{'input': 'January 3, 2018 / 4:48 AM / Updated 12 minutes ago North Korea reopens border hotline as Trump boasts of bigger nuclear button Christine Kim , David Brunnstrom 6 Min Read .SEOUL/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - North Korea reopened a long-closed border hotline with South Korea on Wednesday, hours after U.S. President Donald Trump appeared to mock North Korean leader Kim Jong Un by saying he has a “bigger and more powerful” nuclear button than Kim does. .On Tuesday, Seoul proposed high-level discussions amid a tense standoff over North Korea’s program to develop nuclear-tipped missiles capable of reaching the United States. .That proposal followed a New Year address by the North Korean leader in which he said he was open to speaking with the South and would consider sending a delegation to the Winter Olympics to be held in South Korea in February. .U.S. officials said Washington would not take any talks between North and South Korea seriously if they did not contribute to denuclearizing North Korea. A State Department spokeswoman said North Korea “might be trying to drive a wedge” between Washington and Seoul. .Kim ordered the reopening of the hotline at the truce village of Panmunjom at 0630 GMT on Wednesday, when South Korean officials at the border received a call from the North, the South’s unification ministry said in a text message. .Officials on both sides were checking the line and conducting a conversation for about 20 minutes, the contents of which were not disclosed by the ministry. .There was no immediate U.S. comment, although a State Department spokeswoman, Katina Adams, said Washington remained in close contact with Seoul “about a unified response to North Korea.” .She said that as South Korea President Moon Jae-in had stated, “‘the improvement of relations between North and South Korea cannot advance separately from resolving North Korea’s nuclear program.” .The reopening of the line, which North Korea shut down in February 2016, came only hours after Trump, who has repeatedly mocked Kim as “Little Rocket Man”, ridiculed the North Korean leader again on Twitter. .“Will someone from his depleted and food-starved regime please inform him that I too have a Nuclear Button, but it is a much bigger & more powerful one than his, and my Button works!” Trump tweeted. .Trump and Kim have exchanged insults in recent months, raising alarm worldwide, with Trump at times dismissing the prospect of a diplomatic solution to a crisis in which both sides have threatened to destroy each other. .On Wednesday, U.S. Vice President Mike Pence told the Voice of America Trump was responding to Kim’s New Year comment about having a nuclear button on his desk, and making clear that “America will not be bullied, America will not be threatened.” .Pence said that while all options remain on the table, there was the opportunity for a peaceable solution to the crisis if “North Korea will abandon their nuclear and ballistic missile ambitions, if they will dismantle those programs.” .Former Vice President Joe Biden was quoted as saying by CNN that Trump had shown “really poor judgment” with the tweet. South Korean soldiers patrol near the demilitarized zone separating the two Koreas in Paju, South Korea, January 3, 2018. REUTERS/Kim Hong-Ji .“The only war that is worse than one that’s intended, is one that is not intended,” Biden was quoted as saying. “This is not a game. This is not about, you know, can I puff my chest out.” .“The United States has a role in the world that the world has come to expect. I think the president is much, much too cavalier. And it’s dangerous.” .While appearing to open the door to discussing taking part in the Winter Olympics, Kim also warned he would push ahead with “mass producing” nuclear warheads in defiance of U.N. sanctions. .His New Year’s Day speech came after a steep increase in missile launches in 2017, as well as the North’s sixth and most powerful nuclear test. Slideshow (15 Images) .North Korea visualised - tmsnrt.rs/2ulJhyT .‘SERIOUS AND SINCERE’ .North Korea had shut down the hotline in retaliation for the closing of a border factory town jointly operated by the two Koreas. .North Korea’s KCNA news agency quoted Ri Son Gwon, chairman of North Korea’s Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland, as saying the talks would aim to establish formal dialogue about sending a North Korean delegation to the Olympics. .“We will try to keep close communications with the south Korean side from sincere stand(sic) and honest attitude, true to the intention of our supreme leadership, and deal with the practical matters related to the dispatch of our delegation,” he said. .South Korean presidential spokesman Yoon Young-chan said the decision to open the hotline had “significant meaning” because it could lead to constant communication. .On Tuesday, Nikki Haley, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, said Washington was hearing reports that Pyongyang might be preparing to fire another missile and warned of even tougher steps in response if it did so. .Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said both sides should seize the Olympics as an opportunity to improve ties and make concrete efforts toward alleviating tension. .“All relevant sides should grab hold of this positive trend in the Korean peninsula and move in the same direction,” Geng told a daily news briefing in Beijing. .North Korea regularly threatens to destroy South Korea, the United States and Japan, and says its weapons are necessary to counter U.S. aggression. The United States stations 28,500 troops in the South, a legacy of the 1950-53 Korean War.

{'input': 'January 2, 2018 / 6:03 AM / Updated 2 hours ago Emerging markets sailed through storms in 2017. What next? Sujata Rao 7 Min Read .LONDON (Reuters) - After a year of double-digit returns, one of the key questions for emerging markets in 2018 is whether they will continue to be insulated from one another’s crises. .Contagion, an intrinsic feature of the sector for years, shrank to such an extent that an almost 10 percent drop in Brazil’s currency in a single day in May had little effect on its emerging market peers. .Was that proof investors now treat individual emerging markets on their own merits, rather than as members of a homogenous poor and crisis-prone bloc? Or was it just a function of central bank money-printing and near-zero interest rates? .Both played a part. .Not too long ago, a selloff like that of Brazils real currency BRL= on May 18 last year would have sent central banks in distant Asia and Africa scrabbling to defend their markets via interest rate rises or dollar sales. .Instead, its Latin American neighbor Chile cut interest rates with little weakening in its currency, CLP= while in the Middle East, Oman announced plans for a dollar bond. .Earlier that week, as the corruption scandal which exploded on May 18 brewed in Brazil, “junk”-rated West African state Senegal borrowed $1.1 billion on bond markets. .“Back in 2000, if Philippines sold off in the Asian morning, it meant Russia would sell off in the London morning,” said Steve Cook, co-head of emerging debt at PineBridge Investments. .Cook said his fund did not exit Brazilian markets on May 18, opting instead to shuffle the portfolio towards companies which would benefit from currency weakness. .“Brazil sold off because of political uncertainty but we knew it doesn’t impact Colombia or Peru from a macro perspective.” .But a 2008-style crisis emanating from the United States or China would still spark indiscriminate flight from emerging markets towards “safe” assets such as the Swiss franc, specialists say. .“The single-largest driver of EM performance is and will continue to be - growth. As we are seeing synchronized growth recovery, that’s what is underpinning relatively low contagion,” said Polina Kurdyavko, co-head of emerging markets at BlueBay Asset Management. .Kurdyavko bought Brazilian bonds after the selloff, judging that recovery from economic recession would continue and that “the fundamental story in Brazil is unchanged”. .Around half of the May 18 correction reversed over the following week as local and foreign funds snapped up bargains. STRUCTURAL TRADE .Emerging bonds earned double-digit returns this year, shrugging off Venezuela’s expected default, in a striking contrast to crises in Asia in 1997 or Turkey in 2001, shockwaves from which rippled through the developing world. .Change has been building for a while. There was little contagion from the July 2016 attempted coup in Turkey or Russia’s 2014 meltdown and even in 2013, the so-called Fragile Five developing countries were far worse hit than peers when the United States signaled plans to start unwinding its stimulus. .Russia’s decision on Dec 15 to cut interest rates by half a percent, just two days after the U.S. Federal Reserve raised rates, shows central bank policies are increasingly dictated by their own economic conditions, rather than the Fed. .Mexico and Turkey raised rates a day before Russia’s cut. .Expectations of more U.S. rate rises and the European Central Bank halving its bond buying will test individual emerging economies in 2018, emerging market veterans say. .But the sector as a whole is insulated by sweeping changes within the asset class and its investor base in the past decade. .Improvements made since turn-of-the-century crises are easy to pinpoint - inflation-targeting central banks, floating currencies, and borrowing that is now 80 percent denominated in emerging currencies rather than dollars. .Increasing numbers of investors have also come to view emerging markets as a structural rather than short-term trade. .That includes many Western pension funds which a decade back may have shunned emerging markets as too risky but are now raising exposure to benefit from the high yields on offer. .Thomson Reuters fund research firm Lipper tracks over 13,000 dedicated emerging bond and equity funds, up from about 2,000 back in 2003. And just in emerging debt, the most widely used GBI-EM index is used as a benchmark by funds managing over $200 billion in assets, up ten-fold from 2007, .Because dedicated investors do not tend to bail out wholesale when crisis strikes, “a crisis in one country can be supportive for the other,” said Richard Benson, co-head of portfolio investments at Millennium Global. .Benson recalled when he started his career 15 years ago, most investment firms would have a tiny allocation to developing economies, just to diversify portfolios, whereas now 5-10 percent of total assets are likely in emerging markets .“So if there’s a crisis in Turkey, you underweight Turkey and buy Korea,” Benson added. .Other investors highlight the speed at which developing countries’ own savings pools are growing, allowing governments in the more sophisticated Asian, Eastern European or Latin American countries to meet most of their financing needs from local pension and insurance funds. .And these local investors not only stay put during selloffs, they also usually step up to buy when foreigners flee, limiting market falls. .Chris Perryman, a portfolio manager working with Steve Cook at PineBridge, noted for instance that up to 70 percent of new Chinese bonds are now sold within Asia, versus a fifth when he first started trading emerging debt 14 years ago. .“That’s due to the size of regional asset management capacity,” he said. “The dedicated flow has become more sticky and less likely to run for the hills.” .To view a graphic on Emerging markets performance, click: reut.rs/2Ca59gP .(This version of the story has been refiled with an updated version of the graphic.)

That will provide workers at the bottom of the income ladder with a combined wage increase of more than $5 billion next year, according to figures compiled by the Economic Policy Institute . .Starting Jan. 1, Maine boosted its bottom pay rate by $1, to $10 an hour, an increase that will benefit an estimated 59,000 workers. California increased its minimum wage by 50 cents, to $11 an hour, helping more than 2 million workers. .In most states, the increases are the result of recent laws that raise the pay rates for those at the bottom of the income ladder. Others have laws on the books that automatically boost the minimum wage to keep up with inflation.Thats not the case with the federal minimum wage, which is currently $7.25 an hour. Because its not pegged to inflation, the buying power of a minimum wage paycheck has been falling for the last 50 years, despite periodic increases.In 1968, the statutory minimum wage of $2 an hour was worth about $10.90 an hour in 2017 dollars.

This represents the 356th consecutive monthly dividend since the Trust’s inception in May 1988..The following are annualized distribution rate calculations based on the declared dividend for the month, Net Asset Value (“NAV”) at month-end and the month-end NYSE composite closing price (“Market”)..Annualized Period-end Distribution Rates.DIVIDEND NAV MARKET December 31, 2017 $ .0220 4.60% 5.11% November 30, 2017 $ .0215 4.62% 5.15% October 31, 2017 $ .0220 4.57% 5.05% September 30, 2017 $ .0225 4.84% 5.23% August 31, 2017 $ .0240 4.98% 5.45% July 31, 2017 $ .0250 5.15% 5.51% June 30, 2017 $ .0250 5.34% 5.65% May 31, 2017 $ .0260 5.33% 5.66% April 30, 2017 $ .0260 5.50% 5.78% March 31, 2017 $ .0270 5.51% 5.88% February 28, 2017 $ .0260 5.84% 6.06% January 31, 2017 $ .0270 5.49% 5.70% December 31, 2016 $ .0270 5.50% 5.74% Voya Prime Rate Trust was the first Fund to invest in a portfolio of floating rate senior bank loans. The Trust seeks to provide as high a level of current income as is consistent with the preservation of capital..The Trust is managed by Voya Investments, LLC and sub-advised by Voya Investment Management Co. LLC, and its shares are distributed by Voya Investments Distributor, LLC. The adviser, the sub-adviser and the distributor are indirect, wholly-owned subsidiaries of Voya Financial, Inc. (NYSE: VOYA). The Trust’s operations are based in Scottsdale, Arizona..Distribution Rates are calculated by annualizing dividends declared during the period (i.e., divide the monthly dividend amount by the number of days in the related month and multiply by the number of days in the fiscal year) and then dividing the resulting annualized dividend by the month-ending NAV (in the case of NAV) or the month-end closing price on the NYSE composite (in the case of Market). The distribution rate is based solely on actual dividends and distributions, which are made at the discretion of management. The distribution rate may or may not include all investment income, and ordinarily will not include capital gains..Past performance is no assurance of future results. Investment return and principal value of an investment in the Trust will fluctuate. Shares, when sold, may be worth more or less than their original cost..Principal Risk Factor(s) : The Trust invests primarily in below investment grade, floating rate senior loans that carry a higher than normal risk that borrowers may default in the timely payment of principal and interest on their loans, which would likely cause the value of the Trust’s Common Shares to decrease. Changes in short-term market interest rates will directly affect the yield on the Trust’s Common Shares. If such rates fall, the Trust’s yield will also fall. If interest rate spreads on Trust’s loans decline in general, the yield on the Trust’s loans will fall and the value of the Trust’s loans may decrease. When short-term market interest rates rise, because of the lag between changes in such short term rates and the resetting of the floating rates on loans in the Trust’s portfolio, the impact of rising rates will be delayed to the extent of such lag. Because of the limited secondary market for floating rate senior bank loans, the Trust’s ability to sell its loans in a timely fashion and/or at a favorable price may be limited. An increase in the demand for loans may adversely affect the rate of interest payable on new loans acquired by the Trust, and it may also increase the price of loans purchased by the Trust in the secondary market. A decrease in the demand for loans may adversely affect the price of loans in the Trust’s portfolio, which would cause the Trust’s NAV to decrease. The Trust’s use of leverage through borrowings or issuance of preferred shares can adversely affect the yield on the Trust’s Common Shares. The Trust may invest up to 20% of its assets in loans to borrowers in countries outside of the U.S. and Canada. Investment in foreign borrowers involves special risks, including potentially less rigorous accounting requirements, differing legal systems and potential political, social and economic adversity. The Trust may invest up to 15% of its assets in loans that are denominated in certain foreign currencies, however, the Trust will engage in currency exchange transactions to seek to hedge, as closely as practicable, 100% of the economic impact to the Trust arising from foreign currency fluctuations. Other risks include but are not limited to: Borrowings; Preferred Shares; Diversification Risks; and Concentration Risks. Investors should consult the Trust’s prospectus and Statement of Additional Information for a more detailed discussion of the Trust’s risks..For more complete information, or to obtain a prospectus on Voya Prime Rate Trust, please contact your investment professional or Voya Investments Distributor, LLC at (800) 992-0180 or www.investments.voya.com .

FILE PHOTO: Switzerlands Patrizia Kummer celebrates in the finish area after winning the gold medal in the womens snowboard parallel giant slalom finals at the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympic Games in Rosa Khutor February 19, 2014. REUTERS/Mike Blake/File Photo .Pyeongchang will see no change there but newer events more targeted at millennials and younger audiences may be muscling in on the limelight enjoyed by the traditional blue riband races. .The mixed team event, run already at world championships and featuring male and female skiers in a parallel slalom format with races lasting some 25 seconds, should be a hit on its Olympic debut. .“I think it will be one of the highlights of the Olympics,” women’s Alpine race director Atle Skaardal, a two times men’s Super-G world champion for Norway, said before the season started. .Freestyle skiing, slopestyle and big air snowboarding -- another eye-catching 2018 Olympic newcomer -- have the added appeal of proving more accessible to skiers from non-Alpine nations. .Traditional Alpine skiing has been woven into the fabric of the Games since 1936, even if the men’s downhill did not appear until 1948, and a core element for broadcasters and the commercial sector alike. .That remains the case, despite the increasing range of media platforms and fragmentation of the audience as a whole. .“Alpine is always going to be the blue riband,” Matt Humphreys, winter sports boss at the UK division of ski suppliers Head told Reuters. .”When you look at these other events like slopestyle, skicross, the younger sports, they do capture the imagination probably a little bit better than Alpine because it’s newer and fresher. .“But ... I think it’s always going to be the Alpine that wins out.” DANGEROUS AND DAUNTING .Reflecting its big ticket status, the men’s downhill will be held on the opening Sunday of the Games at the Jeongseong Alpine centre. .About as extreme as it gets, the dangerous and daunting discipline sees racers hurtling in excess of 130kph down the mountain -- and the winner often a surprise from far down the list of favourites. .For U.S. audiences the women’s race on Feb. 21 could be an even bigger deal than the men‘s, with American speed queen Lindsey Vonn and all-rounder Mikaela Shiffrin two of the more recognisable names on the slopes. FILE PHOTO: Croatias Ivica Kostelic goes airborne during the downhill run of the mens alpine skiing super combined event at the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics at the Rosa Khutor Alpine Center February 14, 2014. REUTERS/Stefano Rellandini/File Photo .Vonn, the most successful women’s World Cup ski racer of all-time with a record 78 victories, has a portfolio of sponsors that includes Under Armour, Red Bull and Head and was ranked by Forbes as the third highest earning athlete at the 2010 Vancouver Olympics. .NBC television said Pyeongchang, 14 hours ahead of U.S. Eastern Time (ET), will be their “most live primetime” Winter Games yet and live Alpine skiing will feature on 11 of the 18 nights. .The U.S. network has already reported increased viewing figures for the North American rounds of the World Cup season. .Eurosport Chief Executive Peter Hutton said his broadcaster was also seeing increased viewing figures across snow sports, with all the Olympic competitions to be available on mobile devices. .“Sports such as snowboarding are doing a great job to attract younger audiences,” he added. .Eurosport will also, for the first time, have a dedicated ‘Radical Van’ mobile social media studio at the PyeongChang Snowpark and other venues to cater for new audiences. .The growth of the newer sports, however, was not cannibalising the traditional Alpine events and was in fact benefiting them, according Rob Prazmark, founder and chief executive of 21 Sports and Entertainment Marketing Group. .“That’s a good thing, for the Olympic Winter Games, that they are able to change up the sport to appeal to a younger and a different demographic,” he told Reuters in a telephone interview. .”I think interest in Alpine grows because of the addition of different or extreme sports -- or sports that are really most popular with a younger demographic. The whole business of Alpine is growing. .“Downhill Alpine is still extreme,” added Prazmark, who has been involved in every Olympics since 1984 as a consultant and rights negotiator. .That said, he was aware from his own family how the recreational landscape was changing. .“I’ve got four kids.

{'input': 'January 2, 2018 / 5:41 PM / Updated an hour ago Traumatic events increase headaches and migraines Carolyn Crist 4 Min Read .(Reuters Health) - - Teens exposed to traumatic or terror events may have a higher risk for weekly and daily migraines, according to a study of adolescents who survived a terror attack in Norway. .The findings further the idea that violence and psychological trauma could lead to physical symptoms. .“We have very little systematic knowledge about the physical consequences of terror and violent events, especially since people may not see the association or go to the doctor,” said study author Dr. Synne Stensland of the Norwegian Centre for Violence and Traumatic Stress Studies at the University of Oslo. .“There are people who are not getting the help they need for their physical and psychological complaints, especially when they become more severe or frequent,” she told Reuters Health by phone. .On July 22, 2011, a lone gunman opened fire on the annual Norwegian Labor Party youth summer camp. The man, disguised as a policeman, killed 69 people and severely wounded 33. Many of the 358 survivors saw what happened and risked hypothermia and drowning trying to escape. Most lost friends. .The survivors have been part of several studies to understand how terror and trauma affect adolescents. In this study, published in the journal Neurology, Stensland and colleagues looked at recurrent migraines and tension-type headaches in 213 of the survivors, ages 13 to 20. Trained personnel interviewed the survivors about four months after the attack, again 18 months afterward, and again three years after the attack. .The research team found the terror attack survivors reported many recurring tension-type headaches and migraines, and headaches were generally more common in girls. In particular, the female survivors reported three times more weekly or daily headaches than similar young women in the general population in Norway. .Posttraumatic psychological distress levels were much higher, too. .“We were surprised . . . the link was so strong between terror and headaches, even though we accounted for (many other factors),” Stensland said. .Future studies will continue to observe the physical and psychological symptoms that these teens experience. .“Incidents of terror are unfortunately commonplace worldwide, and although the physical effects are well covered, the invisible scars of psychological trauma receive much less attention,” said Dr. Gretchen Tietjen, director of The Headache Treatment and Research Program at the University of Toledo, Ohio, who wasn’t involved with this study. .“Psychological trauma during critical periods of development affects the brain in ways that alter not only the psyche, but also the metabolic, immune, endocrine and nervous systems,” she told Reuters Health by email. “These changes lead to increased susceptibility to a wide variety of adult diseases that may even be passed on to the next generation.” .These associations extend beyond terror events to childhood maltreatment, emotional abuse and sexual violence, Stensland added. Abuse in peer relationships or social media bullying can have a similar effect. .“They’re keeping a secret and don’t want others to know what happened,” she said. “It’s important for people to know that an increase in headaches could indicate something has happened, and it’s time to talk.” .Stensland would also like to see research on medication and overuse of painkillers. Teens may be able to treat their headaches with over-the-counter medicine, but that doesn’t treat the underlying issues related to the traumatic event, she noted. .“Adolescents medicate themselves, and few go to the doctor, but if you keep medicating like that, it may actually contribute to the chronic behavior,” she said. “Seek help early. That’s the key.” .SOURCE: bit.ly/2A7OdFS Neurology, online December 13, 2017.', 'output': "[['Teens', 'PERSON', 'Experience', 'Traumatic Events', 'EVENT'], ['Teens', 'PERSON', 'Increase', 'Headaches and Migraines', 'CONCEPT'], ['Teens', 'PERSON', 'Exposed', 'Traumatic or Terror Events', 'EVENT'], ['Teens', 'PERSON', 'Risk', 'Weekly and Daily Migraines', 'CONCEPT'], ['Teens', 'PERSON', 'Survived', 'Terror Attack', 'EVENT'], ['Study', 'ORG', 'Author', 'Dr. Synne Stensland', 'PERSON'], ['Dr. Synne Stensland', 'PERSON', 'Affiliation', 'Norwegian Centre for Violence and Traumatic Stress Studies', 'ORG'], ['Norwegian Centre for Violence and Traumatic Stress Studies', 'ORG', 'Affiliation', 'University of Oslo', 'ORG'], ['Lone Gunman', 'PERSON', 'Opened Fire', 'Norwegian Labor Party', 'ORG/GOV'], ['Lone Gunman', 'PERSON', 'Killed', '69 People', 'PERSON'], ['Lone Gunman', 'PERSON', 'Severely Wounded', '33 People', 'PERSON'], ['Survivors', 'PERSON', 'Participates_In', 'Several Studies', 'ORG'], ['Survivors', 'PERSON', 'Ages', '13 to 20', 'GPE'], ['Survivors', 'PERSON', 'Interviewed', 'Trained Personnel', 'PERSON'], ['Survivors', 'PERSON', 'Reported', 'Recurrent Tension-type Headaches and Migraines', 'CONCEPT'], ['Headaches', 'CONCEPT', 'More Common', 'Girls', 'PERSON'], ['Female Survivors', 'PERSON', 'Reported', 'Three Times More Weekly or Daily Headaches', 'CONCEPT'], ['Survivors', 'PERSON', 'Experienced', 'Posttraumatic Psychological Distress', 'CONCEPT'], ['Link', 'CONCEPT', 'Strong', 'Between Terror and Headaches', 'CONCEPT'], ['Future Studies', 'ORG', 'Observe', 'Physical and Psychological Symptoms', 'CONCEPT'], ['Incidents of Terror', 'EVENT', 'Commonplace', 'Worldwide', 'GPE'], ['Physical Effects', 'CONCEPT', 'Well Covered', 'Incidents of Terror', 'EVENT'], ['Psychological Trauma', 'CONCEPT', 'Receive', 'Less Attention', 'CONCEPT'], ['Psychological Trauma', 'CONCEPT', 'Affect', 'Brain', 'ORG'], ['Psychological Trauma', 'CONCEPT', 'Alter', 'Metabolic, Immune, Endocrine and Nervous Systems', 'CONCEPT'], ['Psychological Trauma', 'CONCEPT', 'Lead', 'Increased Susceptibility to Adult Diseases', 'CONCEPT'], ['Abuse', 'CONCEPT', 'Similar Effect', 'Abuse in Peer Relationships or Social Media Bullying', 'CONCEPT'], ['Increase in Headaches', 'CONCEPT', 'Indicate', 'Something has Happened', 'CONCEPT'], ['Increase in Headaches', 'CONCEPT', 'Time to Talk', 'People', 'PERSON'], ['Stensland', 'PERSON', 'Would Like', 'Research on Medication and Overuse of Painkillers', 'CONCEPT'], ['Teens', 'PERSON', 'Treat', 'Headaches', 'CONCEPT'], ['Teens', 'PERSON', 'Medicate', 'Over-the-Counter Medicine', 'CONCEPT'], ['Teens', 'PERSON', 'Few', 'Go to the Doctor', 'ORG'], ['Medicating', 'CONCEPT', 'Contribute', 'Chronic Behavior', 'CONCEPT'], ['Seek Help Early', 'CONCEPT', 'Key', 'People', 'PERSON']]", 'category': 'closed_qa'}

{'input': 'WILMINGTON, Del. (Reuters) - The judge overseeing the bankruptcy of Takata Corp’s ( TKTDQ.PK ) U.S. unit on Wednesday cleared the way for the company’s creditors to vote on its Chapter 11 plan, which critics say limits the legal rights of those injured by its deadly airbags. .Takata and its U.S. entity TK Holdings Inc filed for bankruptcy in June after more than 100 million of its airbags were recalled because they could inflate with too much force and spray metal fragments. .The airbags have been linked to at least 180 injuries and 18 deaths, including one in Louisiana that was identified last month. .During Wednesday’s hearing, the judge reviewed the adequacy of TK Holdings’ disclosures, which attempt to summarize and translate the dense legalese of the company’s proposed reorganization plan. .Critics have said the plan favors automakers over car owners. They used the hearing to test arguments that could be raised again at a Feb. 13 confirmation hearing, when U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Brendan Shannon in Wilmington, Delaware, will decide if the plan is fair and meets other requirements. .Shannon raised the possibility on Wednesday that he might not approve a proposal contained in the reorganization plan to establish a fund to compensate those with personal injury claims caused by airbags in vehicles made by Honda Motor Co Ltd ( 7267.T ). .The trust would pay compensation based on the injury, ranging from $10,000 for bruising to $5 million for death or loss of eyesight, according to court documents. .Car owners would be barred from suing Honda and other car makers could opt to join the trust arrangement. .Sander Esserman, a lawyer representing car owners seeking to recover costs related to the recall, criticized the trust proposal because it limited the rights of consumers by barring punitive damages and paying compensation in installments. .Honda’s attorney, Jessica Boelter of Sidley Austin, said the company was owed $9.4 billion from the recall, which she said was the biggest claim of any automaker. .Takata plans to sell its viable operations to Key Safety Systems, an affiliate of China’s Ningo Joyson Electric Corp ( 600699.SS ), for $1.6 billion. The proceeds will fund restitution claims for automakers and help pay personal injury and wrongful death claims. .Reporting by Tom Hals in Wilmington, Del.; Editing by Matthew Lewis.
