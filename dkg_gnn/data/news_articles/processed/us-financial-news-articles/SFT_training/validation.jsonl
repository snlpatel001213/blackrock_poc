That is what you have to remind yourselves sometimes when you’re older, to go for it. He mixed up the play well, so it was a tough match for me. .“The tiebreak was close, it was good to play that early on in the season, to play those nervy situations with the pulse up high, you’re sweating loads. The match had a bit of everything, so I‘m very happy with the performance.” .Bencic had a tougher outing against world number 15 Pavlyuchenkova but prevailed 6-1 3-6 6-3 before teaming up with Federer to win the mixed doubles dead rubber. .Earlier, the United States scored a 2-1 win over Japan after Naomi Osaka was too ill to participate. Osaka’s withdrawal gave CoCo Vandeweghe a 6-0 6-0 victory in their singles match. .Japan drew level after Jack Sock retired while trailing against Yuichi Sugita but Osaka’s absence meant the Americans were awarded a 4-0 4-0 win in the deciding mixed doubles rubber.

Slideshow (2 Images) .Neither Boeing nor Embraer responded to requests for comment. .On Dec. 21, the two planemakers said they were discussing a “potential combination,” in a move that could consolidate a global passenger jet duopoly. .The talks are widely seen as a way for Boeing to strengthen its position in the regional jetliner market, in which Embraer is strong, thanks largely to its 70- to 130-seat E-Jets. .Less than three months ago, Boeing’s European arch-rival Airbus SE ( AIR.PA ) agreed to buy a majority stake in Bombardier Inc’s ( BBDb.TO ) 100- to 130-seat CSeries jet, putting pressure on the U.S. planemaker to seek a similar partnership. .The Boeing-Embraer talks involve Embraer’s defense business, as well as its passenger business, sources have said. .In the Tuesday report, Valor said Boeing was confident it could convince Brazil’s government that it could safely operate in Brazil’s defense sector, partially by pointing to defense deals the U.S. planemaker has made in countries such as Australia.

{'input': 'January 3, 2018 / 8:26 PM / in 13 hours Trumps ex-campaign manager Manafort sues Special Counsel Robert Mueller Sarah N. Lynch 4 Min Read .WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump’s former campaign manager Paul Manafort sued Special Counsel Robert Mueller on Wednesday, alleging that his office’s investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia exceeds its legal authority. .The lawsuit could be the first legal test of how far Mueller’s mandate extends, a question that is critical to his investigations into Manafort’s and others’ financial, real estate and other dealings. .Under the terms of Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein’s order in May appointing Mueller, the special prosecutor not only can probe links or coordination between Trump’s campaign and Russia but also can look into “any matters that arose or may arise directly” from the investigation. .Mueller’s office indicted Manafort and his business partner Rick Gates in October on charges including conspiracy to launder money, conspiracy against the United States and failing to register as foreign agents of Ukraine’s former pro-Russian government. .Manafort’s civil lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, accuses Rosenstein of exceeding his legal authority to “grant Mr. Mueller carte blanche to investigate and pursue criminal charges in connection with anything he stumbles across.” .“The investigation has focused on Mr. Manafort’s offshore business dealings that date back to as early as 2005 - about a decade before the Trump presidential campaign launched,” the lawsuit said. .It added that Manafort voluntarily disclosed all of the information about his Ukraine work to the Justice Department in July 2014 as part of a since-closed investigation into stolen assets. .In addition to the indictments of Manafort and Gates, Mueller’s office has secured guilty pleas for lying to the FBI from Trump’s former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn and former campaign aide George Papadopoulos. .Both those cases, unlike the Manafort indictment, relate to Flynn and Papadopoulos’ communications with Russians during their work for the Trump campaign. FILE PHOTO: Paul Manafort, former campaign chairman for U.S. President Donald Trump, departs after a bond hearing as part of Special Counsel Robert Muellers ongoing Russia investigation, at U.S. District Court in Washington, U.S., December 11, 2017. .Manafort’s indictment made no reference to any activity related to his work on the Trump 2016 presidential campaign, and the lawsuit asked the court to “set aside all actions” taken so far against him. .A spokeswoman for the Justice Department called the lawsuit “frivolous,” but added that Manafort was “entitled to file whatever he wants.” .A spokesman for Mueller’s office declined to comment. .Manafort’s lawsuit alleges that Rosenstein’s order tapping Mueller violates the Administrative Procedure Act, which governs the government rulemaking process. .At issue is whether the scope of Rosenstein’s order is too broad and runs afoul of the Justice Department’s rules that establish procedures for hiring a special prosecutor. .Stephen Vladek, a law professor at the University of Texas at Austin, said he thinks the lawsuit will fail due to procedural problems as well as on its merits. The case, he said, is a “long shot.” .Manafort’s lawsuit comes as Trump and Republicans in Congress have escalated their attacks on Mueller, the FBI and the Justice Department by accusing them of political bias. .Rosenstein, who appointed Mueller in May shortly after Trump fired former FBI Director James Comey, told Congress last month that he does not think Mueller’s investigation is tainted and sees no reason to have him removed. .Trump has denied that his campaign colluded with Russia, although he has also said he fired Comey because of “this Russia thing.” Moscow has denied meddling in the 2016 U.S. election campaign.

She was 94. .Born in the United States, former journalist Hawley had lived alone in Nepal since 1960 and had become an unofficial arbiter of climbing-related disputes. .Over the years, she became a highly-respected chronicler of mountain climbing in the Himalayan nation, which is home to eight of the world’s 14 highest peaks, including Mount Everest. .Hawley, who was admitted last week to the CIWEC Hospital and Travel Medicine Centre in the Nepali capital, died early on Friday of complications arising from pneumonia, said Prathiva Pandey, a doctor at the hospital. .The global climbing community has lost a “great friend”, said Ang Tshering Sherpa, a former president of the Nepal Mountaineering Association. .“But her memory will live on in the form of her life’s work,” Sherpa told Reuters. .Born in Chicago in 1923, Hawley began reporting for Reuters in 1962, nine years after the pioneering climb of Everest by Sir Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay opened the gates to global tourism in the mountainous nation. .Hawley managed the “Himalayan Database”, a record of major climbs of the Nepali mountains, and a necessary endorsement for climbers to gain global fame by validating their achievements. The database is unofficial, but widely respected by climbers.

{'input': 'The bond markets entering a whole new cycle that would mark the end its decadeslong bull market..Thats according to veteran technician Louise Yamada, whose chart work suggests that a bond breakdown could be in the near future..First, Yamada, managing director of Louise Yamada Technical Research Advisors, pointed to a more-than-200-year chart of U.S. interest rates to explain the longer-term trend for interest rates..The last rising rates cycle was from 1946 to 1981, and from 1981 forward to today, weve been in a falling rate cycle, she said Tuesday on CNBCs Futures Now, making the point that the typical 37-year cycle was over and rates were now beginning to enter a rising rate cycle..This is most obvious with the U.S. two-year Treasury yield, said Yamada. When [the two-year note] went through 1.5 percent, it broke out of a nine-year base, she explained. And weve been suggesting that breakout is indicative of a reversal from a falling rate cycle into a rising rate cycle, which could last one or two decades..In other words, history and current technicals indicate to Yamada that rates will just keep rising, meaning that bond prices themselves could start to fall. But the end result could be positive for the market..If we see tax reform doing better for a lot of companies, I think that you could continue to see a corresponding rise in yields along with an economic improvement, she said. Thats not to say there wouldnt be pullbacks because there will be, we havent seen one in a long time, but I think that you could see rates go easily through 3 percent..And that 3 percent mark, according to Yamada, would be the definitive level indicating that bonds are in a rising rate cycle..On Wednesday, the 10-year Treasury yield hovered at around 2.44 percent..show chapters 200 years of US interest rates in one chart 2:04 PM ET Tue, 2 Jan 2018 | 06:13 Disclaimer', 'output': "[['Bond Market', 'FIN_INSTRUMENT', 'Enter', 'Whole New Cycle', 'CONCEPT'], ['Louise Yamada', 'PERSON', 'Announce', 'Bond Breakdown', 'CONCEPT'], ['Louise Yamada', 'PERSON', 'Operate_In', 'Louise Yamada Technical Research Advisors', 'ORG'], ['US Interest Rates', 'ECON_INDICATOR', 'Relate_To', '200-year Chart', 'CONCEPT'], ['Last Rising Rates Cycle', 'CONCEPT', 'Occur', '1946', 'TIME'], ['Last Rising Rates Cycle', 'CONCEPT', 'End', '1981', 'TIME'], ['Falling Rate Cycle', 'CONCEPT', 'Occur', '1981', 'TIME'], ['Falling Rate Cycle', 'CONCEPT', 'End', 'Near Future', 'TIME'], ['Louise Yamada', 'PERSON', 'Participates_In', 'CNBC Futures Now', 'EVENT'], ['US Two-Year Treasury Yield', 'ECON_INDICATOR', 'Go Through', '1.5%', 'QUANTITY'], ['US Two-Year Treasury Yield', 'ECON_INDICATOR', 'Break Out', 'Nine-Year Base', 'CONCEPT'], ['Louise Yamada', 'PERSON', 'Suggest', 'Reversal', 'CONCEPT'], ['Reversal', 'CONCEPT', 'From', 'Falling Rate Cycle', 'CONCEPT'], ['Reversal', 'CONCEPT', 'Into', 'Rising Rate Cycle', 'CONCEPT'], ['Rising Rate Cycle', 'CONCEPT', 'Last', 'One or Two Decades', 'TIME'], ['Bond Prices', 'FIN_INSTRUMENT', 'Fall', 'With', 'Rising Rates', 'CONCEPT'], ['End Result', 'CONCEPT', 'Positive', 'Market', 'SECTOR'], ['Louise Yamada', 'PERSON', 'Think', 'Tax Reform', 'CONCEPT'], ['Tax Reform', 'CONCEPT', 'Do Better', 'For', 'Companies', 'SECTOR'], ['Louise Yamada', 'PERSON', 'Think', 'Corresponding Rise', 'CONCEPT'], ['Corresponding Rise', 'CONCEPT', 'In', 'Yields', 'ECON_INDICATOR'], ['Corresponding Rise', 'CONCEPT', 'With', 'Economic Improvement', 'CONCEPT'], ['Louise Yamada', 'PERSON', 'Think', 'Rates', 'ECON_INDICATOR'], ['Louise Yamada', 'PERSON', 'Think', 'Rates', 'ECON_INDICATOR'], ['Rates', 'ECON_INDICATOR', 'Go', '3%', 'QUANTITY'], ['3%', 'QUANTITY', 'Definitive Level', 'Indicating', 'CONCEPT'], ['Bonds', 'FIN_INSTRUMENT', 'In', 'Rising Rate Cycle', 'CONCEPT'], ['10-Year Treasury Yield', 'ECON_INDICATOR', 'Hover', 'Around', 'CONCEPT'], ['10-Year Treasury Yield', 'ECON_INDICATOR', 'Hover', '2.44%', 'QUANTITY']]", 'category': 'closed_qa'}

{'input': 'In 2009, 1,400 guests stayed in Airbnb for New Years Eve. On Sunday for 2017, more than 3 million guests did. .Thats according to a recent tweet from co-founder and CEO Brian Chesky..Guests on airbnb over New Years ..The accommodations-rental platform founded by Chesky, Joe Gebbia and Nate Blecharczyk has raised almost $4.5 billion from investors , according to Crunchbase, and is valued north of $30 billion . There are currently 4 million Airbnb rentals across the world in 65,000 cities and 191 countries..The growth of the accommodations-rental, travel platform has been remarkably swift. Just a decade ago, in 2007, the seeds for Airbnb were planted when Chesky and then-roommate Gebbia rented air beds to three guests in their apartment on Rausch Street in San Francisco, because a local design conference had booked up all the rooms in local hotels. The cash the roommates made went toward rent ..It would be easy to say the rest is history, but Airbnb almost wasnt. It took some quick thinking and stunts to build the company users know and love today..Before you head out for the day, its important to check local traffic conditions. Photo cred: @travel_inhershoes .A post shared by Airbnb (@airbnb) on Jan 7, 2017 at 11:59am PST .Saved by Obama .Before Airbnb, there was Airbedandbreakfast.com, which Chesky and Gebbia used to book those first guests in 2007. But hardly anyone else was using the site, says Chesky, in conversation with LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman, on his podcast,  Masters of Scale ..By the fall of 2008, after a year and half of work maybe 50 people a day were visiting the site resulting in about 10 to 20 bookings a day..So for anyone whos worried their company doesnt have enough traction, that was our traction, says Chesky..The co-founders had also gone into major credit card debt for the business — Chesky owed about $25,000 and Gebbia was in for tens of thousands, too. You know those binders that you put baseball cards in? We put credit cards in them, says Chesky ..The bed part of their bed and breakfast model wasnt selling. So, desperate for cash, Chesky and Gebbia decided to distinguish themselves based on the breakfast portion of their business plan..At the time, Presidential candidates Barack Obama and John McCain were squaring off in Denver at the Democratic National Convention. Chesky went to try spread the message about Airbnb..We thought, What would a Barack Obama themed breakfast cereal be called? Obama Os like Cheerios, The breakfast of change. To be nonpartisan, they also came up with Capn McCains, like Capn Crunch: A maverick in every bite..We ended up making a thousand boxes of collectible breakfast cereal by hand, says Chesky. I literally had to hot glue a 1,000 boxes of cereal. .Early Obama Os sketch. pic.twitter.com/4F8y6cRv .— Brian Chesky (@bchesky) November 2, 2011 The cereal sold though — for $40 a box. The co-founders made tens of thousands of dollars with the hail Mary stunt. The money got them through a cash crunch, says Hoffman on the podcast ..Subversive market research .The breakfast incident helped turn the tide. Not long after, the Airbnb founding team was admitted to the start-up accelerator Y Combinator in Silicon Valley. .Y Combinator co-founder and start-up savant Paul Graham gave the co-founders simple and what would turn out to be profound advice: He said, Go to your users. Get to know them. Get your customers one by one, says Chesky..And I said, But that wont scale, recalls Chesky. If were huge and we have millions of customers we cant meet every customer. And he said, Thats exactly why you should do it now because this is the only time youll ever be small enough that you can meet all your customers, get to know them, and make something directly for them..For the duration of the accelerator, Chesky would commute between Mountain View, Calif., and New York City, where most of the sites users were located. In New York, the co-founders would pretend they were professional photographers as a way to meet their customers..I remember we met with a couple hosts. Its winter. Its snowing outside and were in snow boots. We walk up to the apartment and we went there to photograph the home. And were like, Ill upload your photos to the website. Do you have any other feedback? He comes back with a book, its a binder and hes got dozens of pages of notes, says Chesky on  Masters of Scale ..That early adopters notebook of feedback ended up being the inspiration for the companys product road map for what would become Airbnb..Unicorn status .As Airbnb grew in popularity, it launched internationally and built an iPhone app (Nov. 2010)..We had a saying that you would do everything by hand until it was painful. So Joe and I would photograph homes until it was painful, then we get other photographers, says Chesky. Then wed manage them with spreadsheets until it was painful. Then we got an intern..Incredible day yesterday. Joe, Nate and I presented to all 1500 Airbnb employees. 6 years ago, this was the company. pic.twitter.com/KwT6Fgj0kp .— Brian Chesky (@bchesky) February 4, 2015 In 2011, Airbnb raised funding valuing the company at $1 billion, says Chesky. .But things had started to go wrong, too. The apartment of a host was trashed, and Chesky had to make a very public mea culpa . [W]e have really screwed things up, the CEO wrote in a blog post at the time . He alluded to other maladies experienced by hosts, too..The co-founders had to build in 24/7 customer support, a logistics and compliance team and local teams to manage the issues unique to each city. .We are just this little company in our apartment, but as far as the worlds concerned, we have a giant office building and we better be grownups, says Chesky. Airbnb had 50 and then 100 employees, but no professional leadership..Theres no management, theres no company meetings, and theres no communication so no one knows anything, literally nothing. I dont even know how we ran the company. So I instituted some basic things like I have to have an executive team, he says..Its like a video game. You slay a dragon. You think youve completed the board game, and then you have the next level and all of a sudden the dragons get really big..VCs throw money at Airbnb .From the $20,000 seed funding Airbnb received from Y Combinator in January 2009, the accommodations booking company went on to raise a total of 10 rounds of funding. They have raised $4.4 billion in capital from highly esteemed venture houses including Sequoia Capital, Greylock Partners, Andreessen Horowitz and Founders Fund ..Airbnb says it is now more deliberate and measured in its growth..After all, there are some issues: It has to be careful in negotiations with local regulators to do things like collect and remit the appropriate taxes. Airbnbs short-term rentals are also illegal in some places (though Airbnb has been fighting that in court ). And hoteliers that are getting squeezed are not pleased to be losing business. .The pool exerts a subtle gravitational pull on all the guests, so that by the end of the day, everyone seems t', 'output': '[[\'Airbnb\', \'COMP\', \'Operate_In\', \'Accommodations-rental Platform\', \'SECTOR\'], [\'Airbnb\', \'COMP\', \'Introduce\', \'Airbedandbreakfast.com\', \'PRODUCT\'], [\'Airbnb\', \'COMP\', \'Raise\', \'$4.5 Billion\', \'FIN_INSTRUMENT\'], [\'Airbnb\', \'COMP\', \'Valued\', \'$30 Billion\', \'FIN_INSTRUMENT\'], [\'Airbnb\', \'COMP\', \'Has\', \'4 Million Rentals\', \'PRODUCT\'], [\'Airbnb\', \'COMP\', \'Operate_In\', \'65000 Cities\', \'GPE\'], [\'Airbnb\', \'COMP\', \'Operate_In\', \'191 Countries\', \'GPE\'], [\'Brian Chesky\', \'PERSON\', \'Found\', \'Airbnb\', \'COMP\'], [\'Brian Chesky\', \'PERSON\', \'Co-founder\', \'Airbnb\', \'COMP\'], [\'Brian Chesky\', \'PERSON\', \'CEO\', \'Airbnb\', \'COMP\'], [\'Joe Gebbia\', \'PERSON\', \'Found\', \'Airbnb\', \'COMP\'], [\'Joe Gebbia\', \'PERSON\', \'Co-founder\', \'Airbnb\', \'COMP\'], [\'Nate Blecharczyk\', \'PERSON\', \'Found\', \'Airbnb\', \'COMP\'], [\'Nate Blecharczyk\', \'PERSON\', \'Co-founder\', \'Airbnb\', \'COMP\'], [\'Barack Obama\', \'PERSON\', \'Relate_To\', "Obama O\'s", \'PRODUCT\'], [\'John McCain\', \'PERSON\', \'Relate_To\', "Cap\'n McCain\'s", \'PRODUCT\'], [\'Y Combinator\', \'ORG\', \'Admit\', \'Airbnb\', \'COMP\'], [\'Paul Graham\', \'PERSON\', \'Give\', \'Advice\', \'CONCEPT\'], [\'Airbnb\', \'COMP\', \'Negative_Impact_On\', \'Apartment of a Host\', \'PRODUCT\'], [\'Airbnb\', \'COMP\', \'Build\', \'24/7 Customer Support\', \'PRODUCT\'], [\'Airbnb\', \'COMP\', \'Build\', \'Logistics and Compliance Team\', \'PRODUCT\'], [\'Airbnb\', \'COMP\', \'Build\', \'Local Teams\', \'PRODUCT\'], [\'Airbnb\', \'COMP\', \'Has\', \'50 Employees\', \'ECON_INDICATOR\'], [\'Airbnb\', \'COMP\', \'Has\', \'100 Employees\', \'ECON_INDICATOR\'], [\'Sequoia Capital\', \'ORG\', \'Invest_In\', \'Airbnb\', \'COMP\'], [\'Greylock Partners\', \'ORG\', \'Invest_In\', \'Airbnb\', \'COMP\'], [\'Andreessen Horowitz\', \'ORG\', \'Invest_In\', \'Airbnb\', \'COMP\'], [\'Founders Fund\', \'ORG\', \'Invest_In\', \'Airbnb\', \'COMP\']]', 'category': 'closed_qa'}

{'input': 'Taxes White House denies Donald Trump Jr. committed treason The White House on Wednesday pushed back against the claim by Steve Bannon, former White House chief strategist, that Donald Trump Jr.s 2016 meeting with Russians was treasonous. Bannon made the claim in an explosive new book by Michael Wolff, Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House. President Donald Trump responded to the book by saying that Bannon had lost his mind. 37 Mins Ago | 01:42 .White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders on Wednesday called former White House strategist Steve Bannons claim that Donald Trump Jr.s meeting with Russians in June 2016 was treasonous a ridiculous assertion. .Bannon made the claim in an explosive new book by Michael Wolff, Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House, due out January 9. .Even if you thought that this [meeting] was not treasonous, or unpatriotic, or bad s---, and I happen to think its all of that, you should have called the FBI immediately, Bannon told Wolff. .Bannon also said that there was zero chance that Donald Trump Jr. did not bring the Russians — whom Trump Jr. initially believed might have damaging information on Democrat Hillary Clinton — up to his fathers office to say hello after their meeting on June 9, 2016. .Sanders on Wednesday denied that President Donald Trump knew anything about the meeting at the time it happened. As the president has stated many times, no, he wasnt part of that [meeting] or aware of it, she said. .The books revelations have driven a vicious wedge between the president and Bannon, his onetime closest adviser. .Going after the presidents son in an absolutely outrageous and unprecedented way is probably not the best way to curry favor with anybody, Sanders said of Bannons comments about Donald Trump Jr. .Earlier in the day, the president issued a statement saying that when Bannon was fired from the White House last summer, he not only lost his job, he lost his mind. .Speaking to reporters, Sanders said the president was both furious and disgusted by the outrageous claims Wolff reported in the book , copies of which were acquired by news organizations on Wednesday. .Yet Sanders also acknowledged that Trump has kept in touch with Bannon by phone since the former chief strategist left the White House in the summer of 2017. Their most recent conversation, Sanders said, was in early December.

{'input': 'January 2, 2018 / 2:50 PM / Updated 2 hours ago Cricket-Selection headache for South Africa ahead of test Mark Gleeson 3 Min Read .CAPE TOWN, Jan 2 (Reuters) - South Africa have a selection conundrum as they consider their team to face India in the first test on Friday with veteran bowler Dale Steyn far from sure of a place in the side, coach Ottis Gibson said on Tuesday. .“We have to try and pick the best team for the conditions and it is clearly a selection headache, but it is a good headache to have all the best players back and available to play,” he told a news conference. .AB de Villiers has returned after a two-year hiatus from the test arena while Steyn is available again after a year-long lay-off and major shoulder surgery for the three match series against the top-ranked test team. .But Steyn, five wickets shy of becoming South Africa’s top test wicket taker, will only play if South Africa decide to go with an extra bowler on what is expected to be a green, seamer-friendly wicket at Newlands. .“We don’t know just yet whether we will play him in the first test but, depending on the selection, he might well play,” Gibson said. .The 34-year-old Steyn has not had a rigorous examination of his injury since returning to action in November and it is a risk to play him, particularly if he breaks down as he did against England in late 2015 and Australia in 2016. .“I don’t think that if we were to pick a three-man seam attack plus a spinner we would want to put him in, in case something happens and he leaves the team vulnerable if he can’t finish the game,” Gibson added. .“I‘m not saying that will happen, but you don’t want to take that risk with the first test. We have to look at the best combination to try and win the game and he will certainly come into the discussion but it depends on the formation of the team we put on the field.” QUICK WICKET .Gibson, recently appointed South Africa coach after previously serving as England’s bowling coach, said the hosts had asked for a quick wicket to be prepared and that looks likely to be the case at the toss on Friday. But he warned the bowlers they still had to efficiently use the favourable conditions. .“With some grass on the wicket, bowlers sometimes tend to get a bit carried away. You still have to put the ball in the right area. However the wicket looks, you still have to play well on it. We will be playing the best team in the world, so we have to bring our A-game,” he said.

It gave no indication whether the South African government knew of the alleged Iranian activity, or of the Palestinian expatriate’s whereabouts..South Africa, where pro-Palestinian sentiment is strong, has strained relations with Israel, but the Shin Bet statement also suggested the country effectively served as an Iranian spy hub..“It became clear, during the the Shin Bet investigation, that Iranian intelligence used South Africa as a significant arena for locating, recruiting and running anti-Israel agents in the West Bank,” the Shin Bet said, adding that several Iranian officers had traveled there “from Tehran” for the operation..South Africa’s Foreign Ministry and Home Affairs Ministry, and the Iranian embassy in Pretoria, did not immediately respond to the Israeli allegations..DENIAL OF CHARGES The three Palestinians were arrested in November and a trial date has yet to be set, their lawyer, Munther Abu Ahmed, said..“The three young men denied the charges against them,” Abu Ahmed told Reuters. Two of them had been in touch with a relative in South Africa “about business and commercial issues,” he said, adding that their most recent meeting was in July 2016..“We are in 2018 and none of the three men has done anything, and that refutes the charges against them,” Abu Ahmed said..Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told reporters on Wednesday the case showed that “Iran operates in a subversive and terrorist manner ... not just in aiding terror groups like Hamas and Hezbollah and Islamic Jihad, but also in attempts to organize terror activities within the State of Israel against its civilians”..A Shin Bet veteran interviewed by Israel Radio about the case suggested the purported South African link may be unprecedented..“Apparently the Iranians found fertile ground in South Africa,” said ex-officer Adi Carmi, adding: “I do not recall South Africa ever having been used by the Iranians as a terrorist recruiting ground for the aim of carrying out attacks.”.Additional reporting by Nidal al-Mughrabi in Gaza and Ed Stoddard and Mfuneko Toyana in Johannesburg; Writing by Dan Williams; Editing by Gareth Jones.

{'input': 'By Hallie Detrick 9:20 AM EST .There’s a 40% chance that Apple will buy Netflix thanks to U.S. president Donald Trump’s corporate tax cuts, analysts predict. .The Republican tax plan will allow companies a one-time chance to repatriate cash and reduce tax rates for corporate income in the U.S. and abroad . Apple has used overseas tax havens to avoid paying taxes on 94% of its $252 billion in cash . .Bringing some of that money back into the U.S. may allow the company to make major acquisitions. Citi analysts Jim Suva and Asiya Merchant say the company’s ongoing quest to create a viable TV and movie offer made Netflix the most likely acquisition for Apple. Disney was also a top contender for acquisition, albeit before it agreed to acquire 21st Century Fox. .Suva and Merchant say under Trump’s proposed tax holiday on repatriating cash, Apple could have as much as $220 billion for mergers and acquisitions. They estimated the company would only need to spend about a third of that to acquire Netflix.

{'input': 'South Korean President Moon Jae-In has stirred up a decades-old dispute with Japan , a move that risks disrupting the international effort to contain North Korea ..For years, Seoul and Tokyo have been at loggerheads over the matter of comfort women — the thousands of girls and women, many of them Korean, who were forced to work in Japans military brothels during World War II. The two countries reached an agreement in 2015, in which Tokyo shelled out $8.8 million to a fund for victims, but Moon on Thursday criticized that deal , saying it cannot solve the comfort women issue..His comments came after a South Korean panel concluded that the 2015 treaty failed to meet victims demands for compensation. In response to the panels findings, Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Kono warned that any attempt to revise the agreement would make Japans ties with South Korea unmanageable..The matter is a topic of national importance in South Korea, where protesters last week called on the government to nullify the deal, and considered crucial to Moons populist base..Tough on Tokyo, conciliatory toward Pyongyang Seoul and Tokyo are both important U.S. allies and play critical roles in containing Pyongyangs nuclear and missile program .

His administration on Tuesday offered high-level talks to its northern neighbor after Kim said that he was open to sending a North Korean delegation to the upcoming Winter Olympics..Pressing Tokyo on the comfort women issue while attempting to engage Pyongyang has the risks of alienating Tokyo from Seoul, Nagy warned..Kims missile tests, which violate U.N. resolutions, remain a global worry, especially in light of recent hostile rhetoric between the dictator and President Donald Trump ..Pushing Seoul closer to Beijing Tensions between Moon and Abe could also boost Seouls relationship with Beijing , which is currently on shaky footing amid tensions over Seouls decision to install an American-made missile defense system on its soil..China has its own issues with Japan over the latters wartime atrocities, so by antagonizing Tokyo, Seoul pleases Beijing, said Leonid Petrov, a Korea expert at The Australian National University..Tomohiro Ohsumi | Bloomberg | Getty Images Japanese warships at sea. That, in turn, could bother Washington: This will inevitably undermine the regional security posture of the United States that traditionally dwells on the anti-communist unity of South Korea, Japan and Taiwan, Petrov continued. In sum, Moons action creates serious problems for the U.S. security architecture in northeast Asia, he added..Nagy, on the other hand, doesnt expect Beijing will support tensions between Moon and Abe..China will be wary of South Korean efforts to alienate Japan as it could push Tokyo closer to the White House, he said.

{'input': '(Reuters Health) - Among the tiniest preemies, black and Hispanic infants are more likely than white babies to be born at hospitals with worse death and complication rates, a study in New York City suggests..In the study of 7,177 very preterm infants born at 39 hospitals citywide, 28 percent of the babies died or experienced serious complications. Compared to white infants, however, black preemies were almost twice as likely to die or have severe health issues, while the odds were about 50 percent higher for Hispanic babies..This disparity is due at least in part to the fact that white children have a better chance of being born at hospitals that take better care of preemies, researchers report in JAMA Pediatrics..“Nearly 40 percent of the black-white disparity and nearly a third of the Hispanic-white disparity can be attributed to hospital of birth,” said Dr. Elizabeth Howell, director of the Women’s Health Research Institute at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City..“Hospital quality is an important and modifiable cause of racial/ethnic disparities in neonatal outcomes,” Howell said by email..Pregnancy normally lasts about 40 weeks, and babies born after 37 weeks are considered full term. The study focused on the most vulnerable preterm infants, delivered from 24 to 31 weeks’ gestation..During the weeks immediately after birth, preemies often have difficulty breathing and digesting food. They can also encounter longer-term challenges such as impaired vision, hearing and cognitive skills, as well as social and behavioral problems..While black newborns in the U.S. have long had higher mortality rates than white infants, much of this disparity has been attributed to the fact that black women are more likely to have preemies, Howell noted..For the study, Howell and colleagues examined data for infants born in New York City from 2010 to 2014..Over this time, about 8 percent died within four weeks of birth or within one year if they were continuously hospitalized. Almost 23 percent of the babies experienced serious medical complications..Babies were more likely to die or suffer serious health issues when their mothers were born outside the U.S. or had diabetes or high blood pressure..Outcomes varied widely by hospital, with mortality and complication rates ranging from about 10 percent to almost 58 percent..When researchers sorted hospitals into three groups from the lowest to highest death and complication rates, they found black and Hispanic babies were more likely to be born at the worst-performing hospitals..About 43 percent of black preemies and 34 percent of Hispanic preemies were born at the hospitals with the worst mortality and complication rates, compared with 23 percent of white preemies, the study found..The study wasn’t a controlled experiment designed to prove whether or how racial or ethnic disparities might develop among preemies. Researchers also lacked data on some factors that can influence outcomes for these babies, such as neighborhood poverty or exposure to environmental toxins..“Before we make any further inferences, we need to know what is the cause of where these women are delivering,” said Ciaran Phibbs, a researcher at the Stanford University School of Medicine and the VA Palo Alto Health Care System in California, who wrote an editorial accompanying the study..“Once we understand the problem, we can try to take steps to correct it,” Phibbs said by email..Expectant mothers can still try when possible to research the performance of hospitals and choose one that does well for these vulnerable infants, Phibbs advised..“Most deliveries are low-risk, and delivery hospital has no effect,” Phibbs said. “The issue for high-risk deliveries is that they have a limited time of advanced notice.”.SOURCES: bit.ly/2A7msNN and bit.ly/2A7ljpv JAMA Pediatrics, online January 2, 2018..

{'input': 'January 4, 2018 / 8:12 AM / Updated 40 minutes ago Mongolia delays launch of $500-million airport until 2019 Reuters Staff 3 Min Read .ULAANBAATAR (Reuters) - Mongolia has delayed until 2019 the completion of a long-awaited $500-million airport project, originally expected this year, the transport minister said, a setback in efforts to diversify a mining-dependent economy. .To reduce its dependence on commodities such as coal and copper, Mongolia has ambitions to become an air freight hub for northern Asia and wants to develop tourism. .But the new airport is unlikely to open this year as originally scheduled, Roads and Transportation Minister Jadamba Bat-Erdene said, as Mongolia negotiates a management contract with Japanese investors. .“The airport was expected to be operational this year, but plans are for it to be operational within the next year, due to management issues,” he said on the ministry’s official website. .“It is planned to set up a joint management team headed by Japan,” he said in the statement, without elaborating. .The new airport is intended to replace the Chinggis Khan (Genghis Khan) International Airport, and take the name of the country’s 13th-century ruler, regarded as a national symbol. .Mongolia will be able to receive 3 million passengers a year by 2024 at the new airport, about 50 km (31 miles) from Ulaanbaatar, the capital. Its predecessor, a one-way runway built near a mountain range, is prone to disruptions and flight cancellations. .Japan’s Mitsubishi Corp. and Chiyoda are leading construction, with Samsung C&T acting as a subcontractor. .The Chinese Export-Import Bank is providing $140 million to finance a 32.2-km (20-mile) road to the airport. Now under construction, the road is set to be completed by October. .The International Monetary Fund encouraged Mongolia to diversify away from mining as part of a $5.5-billion bailout agreed last year to stabilize its crisis-hit economy. .Coal was the biggest driver of growth in 2017, but exports were hit by transport bottlenecks at the border with China, Mongolia’s biggest customer. .Although the airport could generate non-mining growth, its success could depend on Mongolia allowing more airlines into the market and ending favorable treatment for the state carrier, analysts have said.

{'input': 'January 2, 2018 / 2:41 AM / Updated 5 minutes ago U.S. warns North Korea against new missile test, plays down talks Rodrigo Campos , Christine Kim 5 Min Read .UNITED NATIONS/SEOUL (Reuters) - The U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, warned North Korea on Tuesday against another missile test and said Washington would not take planned talks between North and South Korea seriously if Pyongyang did not take steps to give up its nuclear weapons. .Haley told reporters the United States was hearing reports that North Korea might be preparing to fire another test missile. .“We hear reports that North Korea might be preparing for another missile test,” Haley said. “I hope that doesn’t happen. But if it does, we must bring even tougher measures to bear against the North Korean regime.” .South Korea on Tuesday offered talks with North Korea next week amid a standoff over its weapons programs, a day after North Korean leader Kim Jong Un said he was open to negotiations but that his country would push ahead with “mass producing” nuclear warheads. .Tension has been rising over North Korea’s nuclear and missile programs, which it pursues in defiance of years of U.N. Security Council resolutions, with bellicose rhetoric coming from both Pyongyang and the White House. North Korea sees regular war drills between South Korea and the United States as preparations for war. .Kim said in a New Year’s Day speech he was “open to dialogue” with Seoul, and for North Korean athletes to possibly take part in the Winter Games. He persistently declared North Korea a nuclear power. .Asked about the possibility of talks, Haley said: .“We won’t take any of the talks seriously if they don’t do something to ban all nuclear weapons in North Korea.” .“North Korea can talk to anyone they want, but the U.S. is not going to recognize it or acknowledge it until they agree to ban the nuclear weapons that they have,” she said. .U.S. President Donald Trump, who has led a global drive to pressure North Korea to give up development of nuclear-tipped missiles capable of hitting the United States, held back judgment on Pyongyang’s offer to talk, saying: “Perhaps that is good news, perhaps not - we will see!” A combination of photos, released by the U.S. Department of the Treasurys Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), show what they describe as an attempt by North Korean ship Rye Song Gang 1 to conduct a ship-to-ship transfer, possibly of oil, in an effort to evade sanctions on October 19, 2017, in this pictures released in Washington, DC, U.S. on November 21, 2017. U.S. Department of the Treasurys Office of Foreign Assets Control/Handout via REUTERS .South Korea’s Unification Minister Cho Myong-gyon said the offer for high-level talks next Tuesday had been discussed with the United States. A decision on whether to push back massive joint military drills until after the Winter Olympics which South Korea hosts next month is pending. .Cho suggested the talks be held at the border village of Panmunjom and said they should be focused on North Korea’s participation at the Olympics, but other issues would likely arise, including the denuclearisation of North Korea. .“I repeat: The government is open to talking with North Korea, regardless of time, location and form,” Cho said. .Should the talks be held, it would be the first such dialogue since a vice-ministerial meeting in December 2015. Slideshow (3 Images) .This week’s exchanges follow a year dominated by fiery threats from Kim and Trump, who warned that the United States would have no choice but to “totally destroy” North Korea if forced to defend itself or its allies, even as U.S. diplomats pushed for a diplomatic solution. .North Korea regularly threatens to destroy the United States, South Korea and Japan and tested its most powerful intercontinental ballistic missile in November, which it said was capable of delivering a warhead anywhere in the United States. .Analysts see Kim’s offer as an attempt to weaken the U.S.-South Korean alliance and the U.S. led campaign to raise pressure on Pyongyang through sanctions. .South Korean President Moon Jae-in welcomed Kim’s address and asked his government to move as quickly as possible to bring North Korea to the Olympics, but he stressed that an improvement in inter-Korean relations “cannot go separately with resolving North Korea’s nuclear program”. .Trump said sanctions and other pressures were starting to have a big impact on North Korea. “Rocket man now wants to talk to South Korea for first time,” he said on Twitter, using his nickname for Kim. “Perhaps that is good news, perhaps not - we will see!” .China, which has persistently urged a return to talks to ease tensions, said recent positive comments from North and South Korea were a good thing. .“China welcomes and supports North Korea and South Korea taking earnest efforts to treat this as an opportunity to improve mutual relations, promote the alleviation of the situation on the Korean peninsula and realize denuclearisation on the peninsula,” Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said.

That often means the companies book the majority of their European profits in those countries..DAMIEN MEYER | AFP | Getty Images This photograph taken on September 28, 2017, shows a smartphone being operated in front of GAFA logos (acronym for Google, Apple, Facebook and Amazon web giants) as background in Hédé-Bazouges, western France. When asked whether a projected backlash against the worlds largest technology companies would likely be more of a concern for Europe or the U.S., Franklin replied, I think it is going to be both actually..While lawmakers are expected to put tech giants under the spotlight next year, Franklin said transatlantic companies would also need to watch out for the somewhat unattractively named general data protection regulation (GPDR)..GPDR represents the harmonization of data protection laws throughout the EU. The incoming legislation, which offers greater rights to individuals, aims to apply broader pressure for transparency about the origin and accuracy of content. Failure to comply with GPDR is likely to result in penalties totaling either 4 percent of global turnover or 20 million euros ($23.5 million) — whichever value is greater..The pivotal question: Can global growth continue in 2018? We think yes, UBS analysts said in a research note..Researchers at Switzerlands biggest bank said financial conditions in the U.S. and Europe were easy and most of the adjustments for the global economy were now behind us, leaving the playing field more level and free for growth to catch up..UBS economists forecast global growth to reach 3.8 percent in 2018 — the same level as in 2017 — with all major economies set to participate..Despite the length of the recovery, there is room for global growth to expand amid very few signs of excess in the real economy, the banks analysts said..Elsewhere, PwC projected global economic growth to peak at 3.7 percent next year. The accountancy and professional services firm said a stronger-than-anticipated cyclical recovery in the euro zone and robust growth in the U.S. should be supportive..Trump vs. Macron The next calendar year should also see two competing political ideologies come to the fore, according to The Economists Daniel Franklin..While President Donald Trump focuses on his inward-looking  America First  agenda, Frances President Emmanuel Macron promises a new kind of pro-globalization social contract, one that boosts competition and entrepreneurship while protecting workers who lose out, he said..Trump has been accused of prioritizing national sovereignty over international alliances during his first 12 months in the Oval Office. However, the former New York businessman has insisted he wants to create good, well-paying jobs and his administrations plan includes an America First trade policy alongside corporate tax cuts and an ambitious bid to invest in infrastructure..Nonetheless, Trumps closed world views are in direct contrast to Macrons, Franklin said..The two leaders opposing ideologies have been evident on the international stage before too. Shortly after Trump vowed to withdraw from the Paris climate change agreement, Frances Macron announced an initiative titled  Make Our Planet Great Again  — an apparent rebuke to Trumps campaign pledge to Make America Great Again..Philippe Wojazer | AFP | Getty Images French President Emmanuel Macron holds a sign with the slogan Make our planet great again as he attends the Tech for Planet event at the Station F start-up campus ahead of the One Planet Summit in Paris on December 11, 2017. Meantime, Macron wants to make Frances labor market more flexible in order to improve the countrys economy. He has championed the need for France to become more competitive and made labor reform one of his showpiece policies on the campaign trail.

It seems to be a conservative target, reflecting a slow recovery in China and ongoing U.S difficulties,” Kim Jin-woo, an analyst at Korea Investment & Securities said.

{'input': '* Euro’s 2-1/2 peak against dollar within sights.* Commodity currencies rally again.* MiFID II introduction weighs on volumes.* Graphic: World FX rates in 2017 tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh (Adds details, Quote: ).By Tommy Wilkes.LONDON, Jan 2 (Reuters) - The euro traded close to its highest level in three years against a broadly weaker dollar on Tuesday, the first trading day of 2018, on optimism over a brightening economic picture in the euro zone..It finished 2017 with its best year against the dollar since 2003 as European economies strengthened and expectations the European Central Bank will wind down its monetary stimulus grew, boosting demand for the single currency..The euro started the year by adding to those gains, and climbing as much as 0.6 percent to a four-month high of $1.2081, within sights of the $1.2092 it hit in September, the highest since early 2015..The single currency was also higher against the Japanese yen at 135.64, reaching levels not seen since late 2015..Euro zone manufacturers ended 2017 by ramping up activity at the fastest pace in more than two decades, a survey showed on Tuesday, and rising demand suggests they will start the new year on a high..“It’s a combination of dollar weakness and euro strength. The euro strength is underpinned by some hawkish comments from the ECB’s Coeure,” said Commerzbank currency strategist Thu Lan Nguyen in Frankfurt, referring to comments made by the European Central Bank’s Benoit Coeure.Coeure said on the weekend he saw a “reasonable chance” the bank’s bond purchases would not be extended beyond September..Nguyen said the euro was approaching levels where the ECB might start to signal some discomfort with its rise..The euro gained as the dollar was broadly weak. The dollar’s index against a basket of six major currencies slipped to 91.75, its weakest level since September..For the whole of 2017, the dollar index slid more than 9.8 percent, the greenback’s worst annual performance since 2003..Alvin Tan, an FX strategist at Societe Generale in London, said the end of a dollar funding squeeze typical of December and a rally in commodity prices, had reduced demand for dollars since the holiday season, but that the euro was also gaining because of the better economic performance of its member states..“Fundamentally, what is helping the euro is the brightening economic outlook in the euro area. The momentum should continue,” he said..Tan said Societe Generale forecasts the euro will strengthen to $1.25 by the middle of the year..Some foreign exchange strategists said traders were wary of taking on big positions ahead of the introduction on Wednesday of the wide-ranging EU financial markets directive known as MiFID II, which is aimed at making European markets more transparent and providing better value for investors..For Reuters Live Markets blog on European and UK stock markets see reuters://realtime/verb=Open/url=http://emea1.apps.cp.extranet.thomsonreuters.biz/cms/?pageId=livemarkets (Additional reporting by Jemima Kelly; Editing by Catherine Evans).

{'input': ' 29   UPDATE 1-Brazils Santander rural loans rise to $4 bln in 2017 Reuters Staff .(Adds information and quote from interview) .By Ana Mano .SAO PAULO, Jan 4 (Reuters) - The volume of Banco Santander Brasil’s farm loans rose about 44 percent last year as the Spanish bank’s local unit grew its presence in the country’s booming agribusiness sector, an executive said on Thursday. .Carlos Aguiar, head of agribusiness lending, said the growth catapulted the bank to become the fifth-largest provider of farm loans in Latin America’s biggest economy. .Santander’s loans to farmers and agribusiness companies stood at 13 billion reais ($4 billion) at the end of last year, up from 9 billion reais in 2016. .The bank’s farm lending in Brazil could grow between 10 percent and 15 percent in 2018, Aguiar said, as lower interest rates provide opportunities for private-sector banks to expand in a segment still dominated by state-run banks. .“The fall of the Selic base rate is accelerating our strategy,” Aguiar told Reuters in a telephone interview. .Brazil’s central bank reduced the benchmark interest rate to an all-time low of 7 percent in December, the latest in a long cycle of cuts that began in October 2016 amid government efforts to kick-start the economy. .With loans tailored to farmers and agribusinesses, Aguiar said the bank expects to thrive in the only sector relatively unscathed from Brazil’s deepest recession in decades from 2015 to 2017. .Santander announced plans to open 16 “agro-stores” focused on selling financial products to farmers in the country last year, 14 of which have now been launched. About a third of those will be in the state of Mato Grosso, where recently grain growers have relied more on the barter system to finance their crop. .Under barter, multinational commodities trading firms and agriculture product resellers supply inputs to farmers in exchange for securing future delivery of a portion of their crops. .For the first time since the 2008/2009 crop season, barter represented more than half of crop financing for producers in the state, according to Imea, a research agency based in Brazil’s largest grain producing state. .“Barter is only used in Brazil,” Aguiar said, adding the bank can offer loan options potentially more competitive to producers. .State-run Banco do Brasil SA remains Brazil’s largest rural credit provider, with about 66 percent of farm loans totaling 188 billion reais as of last October, according a ranking compiled by bank association Febraban.

The spread of the disease compounds widespread hunger and one of the worst cholera outbreaks ever recorded. .In a statement to Reuters, the Saudi-led coalition statement did not specifically address diphtheria. .“The Coalition categorically denies blocking any aid or vital provisions from reaching the Yemeni people, and asserts that these claims lack any viable evidence,” a coalition spokesman said in an emailed statement. .A Saudi-led blockade aimed at blocking arms to Houthi militia has ended up isolating a country that was already the poorest in the Middle East, according to the Reuters report and an earlier investigation ( reut.rs/2gzvzjn ). .Vital provisions – food, medicine, fuel, medical equipment, batteries, solar panels and more – are not getting through. .Humanitarian shipments of food and medicine have mostly been allowed into the country, the story said, but Saudi-led forces have delayed both aid and commercial shipments and have also closed ports outright. .The spokesman blamed the Houthis for holding up humanitarian supplies, hurting the supply of medical assistance and interrupting vaccination campaigns by international aid groups.

{'input': 'January 2, 2018 / 5:40 PM / Updated 4 hours ago Traumatic events increase headaches and migraines Carolyn Crist 4 Min Read .(Reuters Health) - - Teens exposed to traumatic or terror events may have a higher risk for weekly and daily migraines, according to a study of adolescents who survived a terror attack in Norway. .The findings further the idea that violence and psychological trauma could lead to physical symptoms. .“We have very little systematic knowledge about the physical consequences of terror and violent events, especially since people may not see the association or go to the doctor,” said study author Dr. Synne Stensland of the Norwegian Centre for Violence and Traumatic Stress Studies at the University of Oslo. .“There are people who are not getting the help they need for their physical and psychological complaints, especially when they become more severe or frequent,” she told Reuters Health by phone. .On July 22, 2011, a lone gunman opened fire on the annual Norwegian Labor Party youth summer camp. The man, disguised as a policeman, killed 69 people and severely wounded 33. Many of the 358 survivors saw what happened and risked hypothermia and drowning trying to escape. Most lost friends. .The survivors have been part of several studies to understand how terror and trauma affect adolescents. In this study, published in the journal Neurology, Stensland and colleagues looked at recurrent migraines and tension-type headaches in 213 of the survivors, ages 13 to 20. Trained personnel interviewed the survivors about four months after the attack, again 18 months afterward, and again three years after the attack. .The research team found the terror attack survivors reported many recurring tension-type headaches and migraines, and headaches were generally more common in girls. In particular, the female survivors reported three times more weekly or daily headaches than similar young women in the general population in Norway. .Posttraumatic psychological distress levels were much higher, too. .“We were surprised . . . the link was so strong between terror and headaches, even though we accounted for (many other factors),” Stensland said. .Future studies will continue to observe the physical and psychological symptoms that these teens experience. .“Incidents of terror are unfortunately commonplace worldwide, and although the physical effects are well covered, the invisible scars of psychological trauma receive much less attention,” said Dr. Gretchen Tietjen, director of The Headache Treatment and Research Program at the University of Toledo, Ohio, who wasn’t involved with this study. .“Psychological trauma during critical periods of development affects the brain in ways that alter not only the psyche, but also the metabolic, immune, endocrine and nervous systems,” she told Reuters Health by email. “These changes lead to increased susceptibility to a wide variety of adult diseases that may even be passed on to the next generation.” .These associations extend beyond terror events to childhood maltreatment, emotional abuse and sexual violence, Stensland added. Abuse in peer relationships or social media bullying can have a similar effect. .“They’re keeping a secret and don’t want others to know what happened,” she said. “It’s important for people to know that an increase in headaches could indicate something has happened, and it’s time to talk.” .Stensland would also like to see research on medication and overuse of painkillers. Teens may be able to treat their headaches with over-the-counter medicine, but that doesn’t treat the underlying issues related to the traumatic event, she noted. .“Adolescents medicate themselves, and few go to the doctor, but if you keep medicating like that, it may actually contribute to the chronic behavior,” she said. “Seek help early. That’s the key.” .SOURCE: bit.ly/2A7OdFS Neurology, online December 13, 2017.', 'output': "[['Teens', 'PERSON', 'Experience', 'Traumatic Events', 'EVENT'], ['Teens', 'PERSON', 'Increase', 'Headaches and Migraines', 'CONCEPT'], ['Teens', 'PERSON', 'Exposed', 'Traumatic or Terror Events', 'EVENT'], ['Teens', 'PERSON', 'Risk', 'Weekly and Daily Migraines', 'CONCEPT'], ['Teens', 'PERSON', 'Survived', 'Terror Attack', 'EVENT'], ['Study', 'EVENT', 'Conducted', 'Norwegian Centre for Violence and Traumatic Stress Studies', 'ORG'], ['Study', 'EVENT', 'Published', 'Journal Neurology', 'ORG'], ['Gunman', 'PERSON', 'Killed', '69 People', 'PERSON'], ['Gunman', 'PERSON', 'Severely Wounded', '33 People', 'PERSON'], ['Survivors', 'PERSON', 'Participates_In', 'Several Studies', 'EVENT'], ['Survivors', 'PERSON', 'Ages', '13 to 20', 'GPE'], ['Survivors', 'PERSON', 'Interviewed', 'Trained Personnel', 'PERSON'], ['Research Team', 'PERSON', 'Found', 'Terror Attack Survivors Reported Many Recurring Tension-Type Headaches and Migraines', 'CONCEPT'], ['Girls', 'PERSON', 'More Common', 'Headaches', 'CONCEPT'], ['Female Survivors', 'PERSON', 'Reported', 'Three Times More Weekly or Daily Headaches', 'CONCEPT'], ['Survivors', 'PERSON', 'Experienced', 'Posttraumatic Psychological Distress', 'CONCEPT'], ['Survivors', 'PERSON', 'Link', 'Strong Between Terror and Headaches', 'CONCEPT'], ['Future Studies', 'EVENT', 'Observe', 'Physical and Psychological Symptoms', 'CONCEPT'], ['Tietjen', 'PERSON', 'Noted', 'Increased Susceptibility to Adult Diseases', 'CONCEPT'], ['Stensland', 'PERSON', 'Added', 'Associations Extend Beyond Terror Events', 'CONCEPT'], ['Stensland', 'PERSON', 'Would Like', 'Research on Medication and Overuse of Painkillers', 'CONCEPT'], ['Teens', 'PERSON', 'Treat', 'Headaches', 'CONCEPT'], ['Teens', 'PERSON', 'Medicate', 'Over-the-Counter Medicine', 'PRODUCT'], ['Teens', 'PERSON', 'Contribute', 'Chronic Behavior', 'CONCEPT'], ['Stensland', 'PERSON', 'Key', 'Seek Help Early', 'CONCEPT']]", 'category': 'closed_qa'}

{'input': '4:43 PM ET Fri, 29 Dec 2017 | 03:24 .By most accounts, shoppers were feeling particularly festive this holiday season . All that spending can leave a nasty financial hangover. .Americans racked up an average of $1,054 of debt over the period, about 5 percent more than last year, according to MagnifyMoneys annual post-holiday debt survey. .Only half of those surveyed said they plan to pay off their holiday-induced debt in three months or less. Of the remaining half, 29 percent said they will need five months or more. .For a shopper making a minimum payment of $25 a month on a $1,054 tab, that means it would take until 2023 to pay down the balance — and youd also be coughing up $500 in interest over that time (assuming an annual percentage rate of 15.9 percent), MagnifyMoney said. The personal finance site surveyed nearly 700 adults from Dec. 21 to 26. .With that kind of burden, its no surprise that about three-quarters, or 74 percent, of Americans said they failed to budget properly for the holidays, according to a separate survey from Varo Money. .Nearly half, or 46 percent, of Americans said they plan to pay off their credit cards within a month after the holidays. Another 16 percent will need one to three months, that survey found. A full quarter of consumers said it will take more than six months to pay off their holiday spending. The mobile banking start-up polled more than 1,000 U.S. adults in November. .Still, Americans continue to take on ever-increasing amounts of debt. Consumer credit card debt now stands at $808 billion, according to recent data from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. .Because of the particularly high interest rates that many credit cards carry, financial advisors recommend focusing on paying down this debt before other types of loans. Here are a few proven strategies for getting started. How to pay off credit card debt .For starters, figure out what you owe. Get balances and interest rates from your latest credit card and loan statements. .If you are juggling several different credit cards, check whether using a debt avalanche or debt snowball payment order would help you pay them off sooner or save you money on interest. .The avalanche method lists your debts from highest to lowest by interest rate. That way you pay off the debts that rack up the most in interest first. .Alternatively, the snowball method prioritizes your smallest debts first, regardless of interest rate. The idea is that youll gain momentum as the debts are paid off and that will motivate you to keep going. .If you need to take further steps to be debt-free, consider consolidating your debt with a personal loan or balance transfer credit card with more favorable terms – just make sure you choose a consolidation strategy with monthly payments you can manage. .More from Personal Finance:', 'output': "[['Americans', 'GPE', 'Raise', 'Holiday-induced Debt', 'ECON_INDICATOR'], ['MagnifyMoney', 'ORG', 'Conduct', 'Post-holiday Debt Survey', 'EVENT'], ['Shoppers', 'GPE', 'Feel', 'Festive', 'CONCEPT'], ['Holiday Season', 'EVENT', 'Relate_To', 'Spending', 'CONCEPT'], ['Spending', 'CONCEPT', 'Negative_Impact_On', 'Financial Well-being', 'CONCEPT'], ['Shopper', 'GPE', 'Make', 'Minimum Payment', 'CONCEPT'], ['Minimum Payment', 'CONCEPT', 'Impact', 'Payment Duration', 'CONCEPT'], ['Payment Duration', 'CONCEPT', 'Relate_To', '2023', 'TIME'], ['Interest', 'CONCEPT', 'Relate_To', '500 Dollars', 'FIN_INSTRUMENT'], ['Varo Money', 'ORG', 'Conduct', 'Separate Survey', 'EVENT'], ['Survey', 'EVENT', 'Find', 'Budgeting Failure', 'CONCEPT'], ['Budgeting Failure', 'CONCEPT', 'Relate_To', '74 Percent', 'PERCENT'], ['Americans', 'GPE', 'Plan', 'Pay Off Credit Cards', 'FIN_INSTRUMENT'], ['Credit Card Debt', 'FIN_INSTRUMENT', 'Control', 'Federal Reserve Bank', 'ORG/REG'], ['Financial Advisors', 'PERSON', 'Recommend', 'Pay Down Credit Card Debt', 'CONCEPT'], ['Debt', 'CONCEPT', 'Has', 'Proven Strategies', 'CONCEPT'], ['Strategies', 'CONCEPT', 'Include', 'Debt Avalanche', 'CONCEPT'], ['Strategies', 'CONCEPT', 'Include', 'Debt Snowball', 'CONCEPT'], ['Strategies', 'CONCEPT', 'Include', 'Consolidating Debt', 'CONCEPT'], ['Consolidating Debt', 'CONCEPT', 'Has', 'Personal Loan', 'FIN_INSTRUMENT'], ['Consolidating Debt', 'CONCEPT', 'Has', 'Balance Transfer Credit Card', 'FIN_INSTRUMENT'], ['Consolidation Strategy', 'CONCEPT', 'Has', 'Manageable Monthly Payments', 'CONCEPT']]", 'category': 'closed_qa'}

{'input': ' 40 AM / Updated 2 hours ago U.S. office vacancy rate rises in fourth quarter: Reis   U.S. office vacancy rate rose to 16.3 percent in the fourth quarter of 2017, from 16.1 percent a year earlier, rising for the first time in at least five years, according to real estate research firm Reis Inc ( REIS.O ). .Asking and effective rents increased 0.6 percent in the quarter, compared with the third quarter, registering the highest quarterly growth rate in six quarters. Rent growth was 1.8 percent for 2017. .“The year-end numbers showed a consistent deceleration in occupancy but somewhat higher rent and employment growth than in previous quarters. We expect this trend to continue at the start of 2018 as more office construction is expected to come on line,” Barbara Denham, senior economist at Reis, said in a statement. .Denham believes businesses may feel renewed confidence in 2018 as the recently passed tax bill should return more profits to their bottom lines. .“This could foster more robust leasing activity. Rent growth will likely increase as well, but we are not likely to see an impact until late 2018 or so,” Denham said. .Net absorption, which is measured in terms of available office space sold in the market during a certain time period, plummeted about 60 percent to 5.21 million square feet in the fourth quarter, compared with a year earlier. .Construction activity slowed, with about 7.00 million square feet of new office construction completed during the quarter, compared with 10.7 million square feet a year earlier.

{'input': '(Reuters Health) - - Teens exposed to traumatic or terror events may have a higher risk for weekly and daily migraines, according to a study of adolescents who survived a terror attack in Norway..The findings further the idea that violence and psychological trauma could lead to physical symptoms..“We have very little systematic knowledge about the physical consequences of terror and violent events, especially since people may not see the association or go to the doctor,” said study author Dr. Synne Stensland of the Norwegian Centre for Violence and Traumatic Stress Studies at the University of Oslo..“There are people who are not getting the help they need for their physical and psychological complaints, especially when they become more severe or frequent,” she told Reuters Health by phone..On July 22, 2011, a lone gunman opened fire on the annual Norwegian Labor Party youth summer camp. The man, disguised as a policeman, killed 69 people and severely wounded 33. Many of the 358 survivors saw what happened and risked hypothermia and drowning trying to escape. Most lost friends..The survivors have been part of several studies to understand how terror and trauma affect adolescents. In this study, published in the journal Neurology, Stensland and colleagues looked at recurrent migraines and tension-type headaches in 213 of the survivors, ages 13 to 20. Trained personnel interviewed the survivors about four months after the attack, again 18 months afterward, and again three years after the attack..The research team found the terror attack survivors reported many recurring tension-type headaches and migraines, and headaches were generally more common in girls. In particular, the female survivors reported three times more weekly or daily headaches than similar young women in the general population in Norway..Posttraumatic psychological distress levels were much higher, too..“We were surprised . . . the link was so strong between terror and headaches, even though we accounted for (many other factors),” Stensland said..Future studies will continue to observe the physical and psychological symptoms that these teens experience..“Incidents of terror are unfortunately commonplace worldwide, and although the physical effects are well covered, the invisible scars of psychological trauma receive much less attention,” said Dr. Gretchen Tietjen, director of The Headache Treatment and Research Program at the University of Toledo, Ohio, who wasn’t involved with this study..“Psychological trauma during critical periods of development affects the brain in ways that alter not only the psyche, but also the metabolic, immune, endocrine and nervous systems,” she told Reuters Health by email. “These changes lead to increased susceptibility to a wide variety of adult diseases that may even be passed on to the next generation.”.These associations extend beyond terror events to childhood maltreatment, emotional abuse and sexual violence, Stensland added. Abuse in peer relationships or social media bullying can have a similar effect..“They’re keeping a secret and don’t want others to know what happened,” she said. “It’s important for people to know that an increase in headaches could indicate something has happened, and it’s time to talk.”.Stensland would also like to see research on medication and overuse of painkillers. Teens may be able to treat their headaches with over-the-counter medicine, but that doesn’t treat the underlying issues related to the traumatic event, she noted..“Adolescents medicate themselves, and few go to the doctor, but if you keep medicating like that, it may actually contribute to the chronic behavior,” she said. “Seek help early. That’s the key.”.SOURCE: bit.ly/2A7OdFS Neurology, online December 13, 2017..

{'input': 'SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Beijing’s crackdown on pollution has put China on track to overtake Japan this year as the world’s biggest importer of natural gas, used to replace dirtier coal..China - already the biggest importer of oil and coal - is the world’s third biggest user of natural gas behind the United States and Russia, but has to import around 40 percent of its total needs as domestic production can’t keep up with demand..Data compiled from the Thomson Reuters Eikon terminal indicates China’s 2017 imports of pipeline gas and liquefied natural gas (LNG) will top 67 million tonnes, up by more than a quarter from a year earlier. LNG imports alone surged more than 50 percent..The data, which includes LNG tanker arrivals to China and pipeline monthly import flow estimates, is preliminary as December figures are not yet available..China still lags Japan, with gas annual imports of around 83.5 million tonnes, all as LNG, but its overall gas imports topped Japan’s in September and again in November, government data and shipping flows show..Analysts say the trend is set and China should top Japan for the full year in 2018..“Both LNG and pipeline imports will continue to increase in the next few years. We expect China to overtake Japan as the world’s largest gas importer in 2018,” said Miaoru Huang, Asia gas and LNG senior manager at energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie..“But Japan will remain as the No.1 LNG importer till around 2028,” she added..China last year started to move millions of households and many industrial facilities from coal to gas as part of efforts to clean its skies, sparking an unprecedented rally in overseas import orders..China’s three biggest LNG suppliers are Australia, Qatar and Malaysia, while pipeline imports come from Central Asia and Myanmar. A pipeline connecting China to Russia is under construction..Unlike established LNG importers which import the bulk of their cargoes under long-term contracts with fixed monthly volumes and a link to the oil market, many Chinese utilities buy LNG in the spot market when they need it at short notice, such as the current peak demand winter season..As a result, Asian spot LNG prices LNG-AS have more than doubled since June to $11.20 per million British thermal units (mmBtu), their highest since November 2014, making LNG one of 2017’s strongest performing commodities..China’s surging demand already pushed it past South Korea in 2017 as the world’s number 2 LNG importer..Reporting by Henning Gloystein; editing by Richard Pullin.

Englands Chris Woakes stretches to field the ball during the fourth day of the fourth Ashes cricket test match.

The company reported net loss from continuing operations of $18.2 million, or $0.02 per diluted share, Adjusted net income from continuing operations of $1.6 million, or $0.00 per share, and Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations of $129.2 million, or 2.4 percent of revenues. Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations in both quarters does not include $24 million of fees that would be earned if all of the stores to be sold to WBA were being supported under the TSA Agreement..“Our pro-forma Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations for the third quarter of $153 million, which includes $24 million in fees that would have been received if all of the divested stores were being managed under the TSA Agreement as of the beginning of the period, was in line with our expectations,” said Rite Aid Chairman and CEO John Standley..“The third quarter was a busy time for our team in preparing for and beginning the transfer of stores and related assets to Walgreens Boots Alliance,” Standley added. “I would like to thank our entire Rite Aid team for their dedication and efforts in accomplishing this important business initiative for our company and our shareholders. To date, we have transferred 357 stores and have received approximately $715 million in proceeds, which we have used to pay down debt. Looking forward, in addition to completing the transfer process, we will continue to focus on our most significant business-building opportunities as we work together to deliver a great experience to our customers and patients.”.As previously announced on November 27, 2017, the company completed the pilot closing and first subsequent closing under the amended and restated asset purchase agreement with Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (Nasdaq: WBA), resulting in the transfer of 97 Rite Aid stores and related assets to WBA during the third quarter. Under the amended and restated agreement, WBA will purchase a total of 1,932 stores, three distribution centers and related inventory from Rite Aid for an all-cash purchase price of $4.375 billion. Rite Aid and WBA expect to continue to transfer ownership of the stores in phases over the coming months. Since the majority of the closing conditions have been satisfied, and the subsequent transfers of Rite Aid stores and related assets remain subject to minimal customary closing conditions applicable only to the stores being transferred in those phases, the company classified the assets and liabilities to be sold to WBA—1,932 stores and three distribution centers— as held for sale and the corresponding operating results and cash flows of those stores as discontinued operations in its financial statements in accordance with GAAP..Third Quarter Summary.Revenues from continuing operations for the quarter were $5.4 billion compared to revenues from continuing operations of $5.7 billion in the prior year’s third quarter, a decrease of $315.9 million or 5.6 percent. Retail Pharmacy Segment revenues were $4.0 billion and decreased 3.0 percent compared to the prior year period primarily as a result of a decrease in same store sales and reimbursement rates. Revenues in the company’s Pharmacy Services Segment were $1.4 billion and decreased 12.2 percent compared to the prior year period, due to an election to participate in fewer Medicare Part D regions and a decline in commercial business..Same store sales from continuing operations for the quarter decreased 2.5 percent from the prior year, consisting of a 3.5 percent decrease in pharmacy sales and a 0.5 percent decrease in front-end sales. Pharmacy sales included an approximate 198 basis point negative impact from new generic introductions. The number of prescriptions filled in same stores, adjusted to 30-day equivalents, decreased 2.4 percent from the prior year period due in part to exclusion from certain pharmacy networks that Rite Aid participated in the prior year. Prescription sales from continuing operations accounted for 66.5 percent of total drugstore sales..Net loss from continuing operations was $18.2 million or $0.02 per diluted share compared to last year’s third quarter net income from continuing operations of $23.6 million or $0.02 per diluted share. The decline in operating results was due primarily to a decline in Adjusted EBITDA, partially offset by a higher income tax benefit..Adjusted net income from continuing operations was $1.6 million or $0.00 per diluted share compared to last year’s third quarter adjusted net income from continuing operations of $26.8 million or $0.03 per diluted share. The decline in Adjusted net income was due to a decline in Adjusted EBITDA, partially offset by a reduction in adjusted income tax expense..Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations (which is reconciled to net loss from continuing operations in the attached tables) was $129.2 million or 2.4 percent of revenues for the third quarter compared to $191.3 million or 3.4 percent of revenues for the same period last year.

French President Emmanuel Macron attends a meeting with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas (unseen) at the Elysee Palace in Paris, France, December 22, 2017. REUTERS/Francois Mori/Pool .According to a Harris Interactive survey for RTL radio, 59 percent of the French were optimistic for 2018, the highest level since 2010 and 15 points higher than a trough in 2012. .Supporters of President Emmanuel Macron’s party were the most optimistic, the poll showed, while those of the far-right National Front were the most pessimistic. .“There’s probably a bit of a Macron effect,” Harris head of political polling Jean-Daniel Levy said, pointing to renewed hope about European integration, one of Macron’s policy priorities. .“There is in particular the feeling of having a presidency that holds water, with good prospects on the economic front,” he told Reuters. .“It’s not only the end of the Hollande years,” Levy added, referring to the broad sense of malaise that marked the 2012-17 tenure of Macron’s Socialist predecessor Francois Hollande. “The French hear a lot about a better outlook for growth, for jobs. There are signs that show France is less depressed.” .For the first time in five years, a majority of 51 percent of the French said the past year was a positive one. .That was in contrast with the 54 percent who thought 2015 and 2016 were negative - years that were marked by deadly Islamist militant attacks. The state of emergency instituted by Hollande over those attacks was lifted by Macron in November.

A Carillion sign can be seen in Manchester, Britain July 13, 2017. REUTERS/Phil Noble .Carillion, which is involved in major infrastructure projects for the British and other governments, has been fighting for its survival after costly contract delays and a downturn in new business. In November it issued its third profit warning in five months. .The investigation by the markets watchdog concerns “the timeliness and content of announcements made by Carillion between Dec. 7 2016 and July 10 2017,” the company said in a brief statement to the London Stock Exchange. .Carillion said it was cooperating fully with the FCA. .In the period under review, Carillion released a full year trading update, its 2016 results, an annual general meeting statement and a 2017 first-half trading update. Its shares fell more than 54 percent over the seven months. .The company announced on July 10 it would undertake a review of its business, suspended its dividend, announced divestments and said it expected overall performance to be below management’s previous expectations. .Carillion also said then that Richard Howson would step down as chief executive and named Keith Cochrane as interim CEO. .Analysts estimate the company is also grappling with debt including provisions, pensions and accounts payable of about 1.5 billion pounds. .Carillion’s shares were down 3 percent at 17.4 pence by 0835 GMT, making up some lost ground after falling more than 8 percent. They have lost 90 percent of their value since the profit warning on July 10. .Carillion’s market capitalisation stands at about 70 million pounds, according to Thomson Reuters data. .Carillion and FCA declined to provide any additional details on the investigation. .Carillion last month moved forward the start date for new chief executive Andrew Davies forward to Jan. 22 from April 2. .Davies, head of family-owned builder Wates Group and formerly with defence company BAE Systems, will replace interim CEO Cochrane.
