Spot gold fell 0.4 percent to $1,312.35 an ounce at 0257 GMT. The precious metal earlier hit $1,321.33, its highest level since Sept. 15. U.S. gold futures were mostly unchanged at $1,315.60 an ounce. Relative strength index shows the metal at overbought levels, which may lead to short term selling, ScotiaMocatta analysts said in a research note. The 14-day relative strength index (RSI) for spot gold touched 75 on Tuesday, it highest since September 2017. An RSI above 70 indicates a commodity is overbought and could lead to a price correction. The dollar index , which measures the greenback against a basket of six major currencies, was up 0.1 percent at 91.964 after falling to a more than three-month low Tuesday. The dollar posted its biggest annual drop since 2003 in 2017, helping gold to an annual increase of more than 13 percent. Bullion surged $55 an ounce in the last three weeks of 2017 alone. Golds medium-term outlook appeared positive, analysts said. At this moment we are expecting some kind of inflationary expectations. People are more optimistic with stock rally are also expecting returns in commodities including gold, said Mark To, head of research at Hong Kongs Wing Fung Financial Group. We should tap the short term opportunities to go long as gold has crossed $1,300 with a momentum. It may act as a support, while $1,340 could be an immediate resistance level and we might reach $1,400 in the first quarter this year. Spot gold may break a resistance at $1,326 per ounce and rise towards the next resistance at $1,380 in three months, according to Reuters technical analyst Wang Tao. Later on Wednesday, investors will turn their attention to the minutes of the Federal Reserves December policy meeting, when it raised interest rates for the third time in 2017. Further cues are likely from U.S. economic data this week, including jobs figures on Friday. Among other precious metals, spot palladium fell 0.1 percent to $1,090.80 an ounce, after hitting a record high on Tuesday at $1,096.50 The metal, which soared 57 percent in 2017, has been surging on fears of short supplies. Analysts expect that about 80 percent of global palladium demand will come from autocatalysts for gasoline-powered cars, which many consumers now prefer over diesel-fuelled vehicles. Spot silver fell 0.8 percent to $17.05 an ounce, after hitting a six-week high at $17.21 earlier in the session. Spot platinum fell 0.8 percent to $936.10 an ounce.

FILE PHOTO - U.S. President Donald Trump speaks during an address from the White House in Washington, U.S., December 6, 2017. REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque/File Picture .Trump said that Washington gives Palestinians “HUNDRED OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS a year and get no appreciation or respect. They don’t even want to negotiate a long overdue peace treaty with Israel ... with the Palestinians no longer willing to talk peace, why should we make any of these massive future payments to them?” .The President’s tweets follow plans disclosed by his U.N. ambassador earlier on Tuesday to stop funding a United Nations agency that provides humanitarian aid to Palestinian refugees. .“The President has basically said he doesn’t want to give any additional funding, or stop funding, until the Palestinians agree to come back to the negotiation table,” Ambassador Nikki Haley told reporters when asked about future U.S. funding for the U.N. Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian refugees. .The U.S. is the largest donor to the agency, with a pledge of nearly $370 million as of 2016, according to UNRWA’s website. .Relations between the Palestinians and Washington soured early last month after Trump recognised Jerusalem as Israel’s capital, generating outrage across the Arab world and concern among Washington’s Western allies. .Weeks later, more than 120 countries defied Trump and voted in favour of a U.N. General Assembly resolution calling for the United States to drop its stance on Jerusalem’s status. .“What we saw with the resolution was not helpful to the situation,” Haley said on Tuesday. .“The Palestinians now have to show to the world that they want to come to the table. As of now, they’re not coming to the table but they asked for aid. We’re not giving the aid, we’re going to make sure that they come to the table and we want to move forward with the peace process,” she said. .Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has called the Trump administration’s decision on Jerusalem the “greatest crime” and a flagrant violation of international law, and said it was unacceptable for the United States to have a role in the Middle East peace process because it was biased in favour of Israel. .On Tuesday, the Israeli Parliament passed an amendment that would make it harder for it to cede control over parts of Jerusalem in any peace deal with the Palestinians.

{'input': 'January 2, 2018 / 9:44 PM / in 15 hours New U.S. tax law could impact paychecks by February Beth Pinsker 4 Min Read .NEW YORK (Reuters) - The first paychecks of 2018 will be dispatched soon, but it may be weeks or months before taxpayers and payroll processors know how the new U.S. tax laws will affect your take-home pay. .The Internal Revenue Service said it expected to issue guidance in January on how much in taxes employers should withhold based on the new tax rates. Employers and payroll services would then implement those changes starting in February. .You might not even notice when it happens because the effect on your paycheck could be relatively small, depending on your income and your tax situation. .“When the taxes are reduced by 1 to 3 percent, that’s not going to be a huge noticeable difference. It’s not going to be hundreds of dollars,” said Pete Isberg, vice president of government relations at ADP, the largest payroll processor in the United States, servicing the paychecks of one out of every six workers. .A difference of $1,000, for instance, would be less than $40 a pop for a worker paid biweekly. .Your paycheck is not actually a clear indicator of whether your overall taxes have gone up or down because of the new tax law. There may be other factors in your tax situation - such as owning a property or having multiple children - that could affect how much you owe Uncle Sam at the end of the year. .Be prepared for tax uncertainty until you do your taxes for 2018 a year or so from now. You cannot even estimate your taxes until tax professionals and do-it-yourself services like TurboTax update their software. And that cannot happen until the IRS releases the new withholding tables and issues more guidance on the specifics of other tax changes. .“We will be ready to help our customers. We just need more information,” said David Williams, executive director of the Intuit Tax and Financial Center. WAITING FOR W-4 FORMS .You may be tempted to get a jump on the IRS and change how much tax is taken out of your paycheck by adjusting your W-4 form, but that may be premature, warned Isberg. .The IRS said in its last note that it would be attempting to work with existing W-4 forms for now. .The standard federal W-4, which all employees fill out, is based on the notion of “allowances,” which you could adjust based on your personal situation. .In the past, a single person with three children and a home in a high-tax state like New York might have listed themselves as married and claim one allowance per person, plus a few extra because they were likely to itemize their deductions and owe less. A married person with a freelance spouse who owes quarterly taxes might have listed themselves as single to have enough taken out to cover both of them. .The goal of people adjusting their withholding was to come as close as possible to paying the correct amount of tax - rather than owing money at the end of the year or ending up with a giant refund. .But it will all be different math for 2018. .“For first few weeks of January stay put, and see what the IRS comes out with,” said Isberg, who also cautioned that employees should keep an eye on tax changes at the state level. .Above all, do not panic, said Farsheed Ferdowsi, president and CEO of Inova Payroll, which handles paychecks for more than 3,000 companies. .“When you have changes in taxes, it usually goes a lot smoother than most people know,” Ferdowsi said. “If the first (paycheck) is wrong, it catches up on the next one.” Editing by Lauren Young and Lisa Shumaker', 'output': "[['New U.S. tax law', 'EVENT', 'Impact', 'Paychecks', 'COMP'], ['New U.S. tax law', 'EVENT', 'Relate_To', 'Taxpayers', 'PERSON'], ['New U.S. tax law', 'EVENT', 'Relate_To', 'Payroll Processors', 'COMP'], ['Internal Revenue Service', 'ORG/GOV', 'Announce', 'Guidance', 'EVENT'], ['Employers', 'COMP', 'Implement', 'Changes', 'EVENT'], ['Employers', 'COMP', 'Operate_In', 'February', 'GPE'], ['Paychecks', 'COMP', 'Has', 'Small Effect', 'CONCEPT'], ['Paychecks', 'COMP', 'Relate_To', 'Take-home Pay', 'CONCEPT'], ['Paychecks', 'COMP', 'Relate_To', 'Income', 'CONCEPT'], ['Paychecks', 'COMP', 'Relate_To', 'Tax Situation', 'CONCEPT'], ['Taxpayers', 'PERSON', 'Prepare', 'Tax Uncertainty', 'CONCEPT'], ['IRS', 'ORG/GOV', 'Release', 'New Withholding Tables', 'PRODUCT'], ['IRS', 'ORG/GOV', 'Issue', 'More Guidance', 'EVENT'], ['Employees', 'PERSON', 'Need', 'More Information', 'CONCEPT'], ['Employees', 'PERSON', 'Adjust', 'W-4 Forms', 'PRODUCT'], ['IRS', 'ORG/GOV', 'Work', 'Existing W-4 Forms', 'PRODUCT'], ['Standard Federal W-4', 'PRODUCT', 'Based_On', 'Allowances', 'CONCEPT'], ['Employees', 'PERSON', 'Adjust', 'Allowances', 'CONCEPT'], ['Employees', 'PERSON', 'Come', 'Close', 'CONCEPT', 'Paying', 'CONCEPT', 'Correct', 'CONCEPT', 'Amount', 'CONCEPT', 'Tax', 'CONCEPT'], ['Employees', 'PERSON', 'Owe', 'Money', 'CONCEPT', 'End_Of', 'CONCEPT', 'Year', 'GPE'], ['Employees', 'PERSON', 'End_Up', 'Giant Refund', 'CONCEPT'], ['IRS', 'ORG/GOV', 'Update', 'Software', 'PRODUCT'], ['Tax Professionals', 'PERSON', 'Update', 'Their Software', 'PRODUCT'], ['Do-it-yourself Services', 'COMP', 'Like TurboTax', 'PRODUCT', 'Update', 'Their Software', 'PRODUCT'], ['Employees', 'PERSON', 'Adjust', 'W-4 Forms', 'PRODUCT'], ['Employees', 'PERSON', 'Premature', 'Warned', 'Isberg', 'PERSON'], ['IRS', 'ORG/GOV', 'Work', 'Existing W-4 Forms', 'PRODUCT'], ['Employees', 'PERSON', 'Stay', 'Put', 'CONCEPT'], ['Employees', 'PERSON', 'See', 'What', 'PRON', 'Comes', 'Out', 'WITH', 'PRON'], ['Employees', 'PERSON', 'Keep', 'Eye', 'On', 'Tax Changes', 'EVENT', 'At', 'CONCEPT', 'State', 'GPE', 'Level'], ['People', 'PERSON', 'Do', 'Not', 'Panic', 'CONCEPT'], ['Changes', 'CONCEPT', 'Taxes', 'CONCEPT', 'Usually', 'CONCEPT', 'Go', 'CONCEPT', 'Smoother', 'CONCEPT', 'Most', 'CONCEPT', 'People', 'PERSON', 'Know', 'CONCEPT'], ['First', 'CONCEPT', 'Pay', 'CONCEPT', 'Wrong', 'CONCEPT', 'Catches', 'CONCEPT', 'Up', 'CONCEPT', 'Next', 'CONCEPT', 'One', 'CONCEPT']]", 'category': 'closed_qa'}

Dr. Jonathan Finder started Oldphones.com 16 years ago when he was a young physician, and the second income helped him pay off student loans. .Now his job as a pediatric lung specialist keeps him from putting in the time to acquire new customers. And a downturn in landline sales has hurt business. .But he keeps at it, in no small part because he’s an unabashed fan of the craftsmanship and history of his merchandise. “How many electromechanical objects that are 50 to 70 years old do exactly what they did when they were first made?” Finder says. “The phones of the ’30s and ’40s outclass anything on the market today.” A new calling .For other entrepreneurs, like Woodbury, retro devices are their sole focus. The market for these phones would seem pretty small to build a business on. Two groups—the Antique Telephone Collectors Association and Telephone Collectors International—have only 1,125 members total. .Don’t miss: This is the vintage technology some companies are using to store your data .Yet buyers have been eager enough not only to keep Woodbury’s operation afloat but allow it to thrive, even enough to support a four-person staff. Revenue, he says, can hit 50,000 Canadian dollars (roughly US$39,000) in a good month, and though he doesn’t track long-term growth, he says that sales have shown a consistent year-to-year increase since the beginning. .When original equipment is unavailable, the company uses reproduction parts—such as cloth-covered cords—manufactured in its own workshop. Additionally, Oldphoneworks.com has the capability to repair and refurbish models that aren’t in its inventory, a service that accounts for about 10% of the company’s revenue. .Woodbury’s customers are both “repeat buyers; people who are going through their collection and want to upgrade, so they’ll come to us to order the one part they need,” he says, and “a lot of one-offs, where someone Googles us because they need parts.” .Typically, Woodbury gets his inventory from individuals or estates looking to liquidate their collections. His average telephone sale is $250, a healthy return on his average investment of $50, not counting the cost of labor for refurbishing. Prices usually range from $100 to as much as $8,000 for a rare model, such as the 1905 Strowger Candlestick, the first commercially available dial telephone. .(A Kansas City undertaker, Almon Strowger, believed that the only local operator was steering business calls to his competitor, who also happened to be her husband. So he invented dial service, bypassing operator intervention.) OldPhoneWorks.com Hello! This Strowger Candlestick dial phone goes for $7,999. .“A phone like that may sit there for five years, but eventually someone will buy it,” Woodbury says. “If people really want something, they’re willing to pay for it. You just have to be patient.” .To build consumer trust, he offers a one-year, repair-or-replace warranty—which gives him an edge over garage sales and flea markets, where the mantra is “Let the buyer beware.” He also says he can offer items in bulk, which is difficult for other dealers. A trunk line .The company doesn’t do much marketing. Mostly it involves making sure customers can find 20th-century technology using 21st-century methods. General manager Matt Jennings, 31, makes updating social media a top priority, trying to land the company at the top of Google rankings in their category. .When he answered a help-wanted ad two years ago, he didn’t know a spit-cup receiver from an F1 handset. “I thought I’d be repairing cellphones. I certainly didn’t think this would be much of a market,” he says. “After my first day, I realized I was wrong.” .Beth Howe, like many buyers, found her way to Oldphoneworks by googling.

{'input': '1 Hour Ago | 02:32 .Federal Reserve officials expect reductions in corporate and personal taxes to boost consumer and business spending, though they remain unsure of the impact of the new tax law, according to minutes released Wednesday from their December meeting. .Members of the Federal Open Market Committee increased their expectations for 2018 GDP growth from 2.1 percent, or about trend since the post-financial crisis recovery, to 2.5 percent. .Most participants indicated that prospective changes in federal tax policy were a factor that led them to boost their projections of real GDP growth over the next couple of years, the minutes stated. .The FOMC is the Feds monetary policymaking arm. The committee at the meeting voted to increase its benchmark interest rate a quarter point to 1.25 percent to 1.5 percent. The rate is tied to most consumer credit rates. .Much of the discussion as reflected in the minutes show strong observations on the economy. The meeting summary points to significant improvements in payrolls as the unemployment rate dipped to 4.1 percent, and noted that industrial production increased briskly. .Holiday spending was strong in several Fed districts, as many participants expected the proposed cuts in personal taxes to provide some boost to consumer spending. In addition, officials observed that stock market prices improved as well, part of a year in which the S&P 500 rose about 20 percent. .At least some of the credit, particularly for the market gains, went to anticipation of the Republican tax overhaul. Congress had not yet passed the measure when the FOMC met Dec. 12-13. The plan, now law, slashes the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent and lowered income tax brackets for most payers. show chapters 9:26 AM ET Tue, 2 Jan 2018 | 03:53 .Broad equity price indexes rose over the intermeeting period, likely reflecting in part investors perceptions of increased odds for the passage of federal tax legislation and an associated potential boost to corporate earnings, the minutes stated. .Looking at conditions more broadly, the document said: Real economic activity appeared to be growing at a solid pace, buttressed by gains in consumer and business spending, supportive financial conditions, and an improving global economy. .However, the minutes on multiple occasions noted that officials remained unsure over just how much a boost in activity would come from the tax plan. For instance, members were quite uncertain about the impact the tax cuts would have on labor supply. .There also was concern, as relayed from business contacts, that the windfall corporations would get from tax cuts would be spent on dividends and share buybacks. .Officials also remained somewhat at loggerheads when it came to inflation. The Fed has consistently missed its 2 percent target for price rises, and members discussed at length the reasons why the reading has remained so low. .Fed officials collectively see inflation likely to meet the target over the medium term, but two members — Neel Kashkari and Charles Evans — voted against the rate hike because theyd like to see more progress on the target. .Most officials judged that much of the softness in core inflation this year reflected transitory factors and that inflation would begin to rise as the influence of these factors waned. However, there was some concern that inflation might stay below the objective for longer than they currently expected. .On other matters, committee members also were largely dismissive about concerns over the yield curve, or the difference in bond yields across various maturities. While an inverted curve — when short-term rates are higher than longer-term rates — often signals a recession, Fed officials said other factors were likely at play that are less ominous. .They generally agreed that the current degree of flatness of the yield curve was not unusual by historical standards. However, several participants thought that it would be important to continue to monitor the slope of the yield curve, the minutes said. .There again were some concerns about market valuations. .While generally looking favorably on the rising stock market indexes, some officials have expressed concern that keeping policy overly accommodative could inflate bubbles. .In light of elevated asset valuations and low financial market volatility, a couple of participants expressed concern that the persistence of highly accommodative financial conditions could, over time, pose risks to financial stability, the minutes said.

Acting German Chancellor Angela Merkel address a news conference at the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) party headquarters in Berlin, Germany, December 18, 2017. REUTERS/Hannibal Hanschke .Merkel, under pressure after failing to form a government three months after national elections, hopes to secure a fourth term in office by persuading the centre-left SPD to join the government despite punishing losses in September’s election. .Party leaders will meet for preliminary talks on Jan. 3 ahead of exploratory talks scheduled for Jan. 7 through Jan. 12, but a growing number of politicians now say Merkel might have to rule with a minority government, or face new elections. .SPD deputy leader Thorsten Schaefer-Guembel said recent comments by some conservatives were “counterproductive for every form of government formation” and said they had sparked doubts about the will of conservatives to govern together. .He said a deal on a new coalition was far from certain and it was unclear if the talks could develop sufficient trust. .“A minority government remains an option, even if Chancellor Angela Merkel doesn’t want to acknowledge that,” he said in an interview published Tuesday in the Passauer Neue Presse newspaper. .Schaefer-Guembel cited differences with conservatives on a range of issues and rejected as “absurd” proposals by some conservatives to cut taxes for high-income earners. .Conservatives and the SPD are also at odds over healthcare, immigration, Europe, work regulations and pensions. .Schaefer-Guembel said he backed calls by SPD parliamentary leader Andrea Nahles to raise taxes for the wealthiest and urge fresh efforts to prevent big companies from evading taxes. .Merkel’s Bavarian sister party, the CSU, has distanced itself from the SPD through policy papers calling for corporate tax cuts, reductions in benefits for asylum seekers, higher military spending and limits on immigration. .The powerful economic council of Merkel’s Christian Democrats (CDU) said it will urge CSU party leaders to push for a minority government when they meet this week, arguing that Germany would face “enormous financial burdens for generations” if the SPD pushed through its spending plans in a coalition. .“A grand coalition will be more expensive in the long term than a minority government,” Wolfgang Steiger, secretary general of the council told the Augsburger Allgemeine newspaper. .The SPD initially wanted to stay in opposition, but agreed to explore the possibility of governing with the conservatives in the interest of political stability after Merkel’s coalition talks with two smaller parties collapsed in November. .Experts say new elections could hand more gains to the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party that entered parliament for the first time in September. Merkel says a new coalition would be more stable than minority government. .Bavarian Interior Minister Joachim Herrmann, a CSU negotiator, told the Funke media group his party would insist on limiting immigration levels. It wanted to extend a temporary ban on family reunifications for migrants who were granted “subsidiary protection”, an asylum status for those not officially classed as refugees. .He said his party viewed it as a democratic responsibility to negotiate a new coalition if policy gaps could be overcome. .“I hope the Social Democrats feel the same sense of responsibility,” he said. “We have an urgent need for action on the legislative front.... We urgently need clear majorities in parliament, we need reliable coalitions.” .A top member of the pro-business Free Democrats, which dropped out of coalition talks with conservatives and Greens in November, said such a coalition remained a future possibility. .Alexander Lambsdorff, deputy leader of the FDP’s parliamentary group, also told the Heilbronner Stimme newspaper that he did not exclude the possibility of new elections or a minority government. “That would not be nice, but it also would not result in a constitutional crisis,” he said.

But if it does, we must bring even tougher measures to bear against the North Korean regime,” Haley said..South Korea on Tuesday offered talks with North Korea next week, amid a tense standoff over Pyongyang’s nuclear and missile programmes, after North Korean leader Kim Jong Un said in a New Year’s Day speech that he was “open to dialogue” with Seoul..Kim also said he was open to the possibility of North Korean athletes taking part in Winter Olympics South Korea hosts next month..At the same time, he stressed that his country would push ahead with “mass producing” nuclear warheads in defiance of U.N. sanctions and that he had a nuclear button on his desk capable of launching missiles at the United States..U.S. President Donald Trump responded to Kim in a Twitter post on Tuesday: “Will someone from his depleted and food starved regime please inform him that I too have a Nuclear Button, but it is a much bigger & more powerful one than his, and my Button works!”.Haley said the United States would not take talks seriously if they did not take steps toward banning North Korea’s nuclear weapons..“North Korea can talk to anyone they want, but the U.S. is not going to recognize it or acknowledge it until they agree to ban the nuclear weapons that they have,” she said..Haley gave no details of the missile test preparations..Another U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said there were indications that could point toward a potential missile launch sooner rather than later, but cautioned that such signs had been seen in the past and no test had resulted..‘Drive a wedge’ U.S. State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said North Korea might be “trying to drive a wedge of some sort” between the United States and South Korea and added that while it was up to Seoul to decide who it talked to: “We are very skeptical of Kim Jong Un’s sincerity in sitting down and having talks.”.Trump, who has led a global drive to pressure North Korea through sanctions to give up development of nuclear-tipped missiles capable of hitting the United States, earlier held back judgment on Pyongyang’s offer to talk, saying on Twitter:.“Rocket man now wants to talk to South Korea for first time..“Perhaps that is good news, perhaps not – we will see!”.Trump has frequently derided Kim as “rocket man.” The U.S. president said sanctions and other pressures were starting to have a big impact on North Korea..Kim and Trump have exchanged fiery barbs in the last year and the U.S. president has warned that the United States would have no choice but to “totally destroy” North Korea if forced to defend itself or its allies..North Korea regularly threatens to destroy the United States, South Korea and Japan and tested its most powerful intercontinental ballistic missile in November, which it said was capable of delivering a warhead anywhere in the United States..For more on North Korea’s nuclear ambitions, watch Fortune’s video:..South Korea’s Unification Minister Cho Myong-gyon said the offer for high-level talks next Tuesday had been discussed with the United States. Nauert said she was not aware if the matter had been discussed in advance of the South Korean response..Cho suggested the talks be held at the border village of Panmunjom and said they should be focused on North Korea’s participation at the Olympics, but other issues would likely arise, including the denuclearisation of North Korea..“I repeat: The government is open to talking with North Korea, regardless of time, location and form,” Cho said..Should the talks be held, it would be the first such dialogue since a vice-ministerial meeting in December 2015..South Korean President Moon Jae-in welcomed Kim’s New Year address and asked his government to move as quickly as possible to bring North Korea to the Olympics, but he stressed that an improvement in inter-Korean relations “cannot go separately with resolving North Korea’s nuclear programme”..China, which has persistently urged a return to talks to ease tensions, said recent positive comments from North and South Korea were a good thing..“China welcomes and supports North Korea and South Korea taking earnest efforts to treat this as an opportunity to improve mutual relations, promote the alleviation of the situation on the Korean peninsula and realize denuclearization on the peninsula,” Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said.', 'output': "[['Nikki Haley', 'PERSON', 'Warn', 'North Korea', 'GPE'], ['North Korea', 'GPE', 'Prepare', 'Missile Test', 'EVENT'], ['United States', 'GPE', 'Impose', 'Tougher Measures', 'ACT'], ['South Korea', 'GPE', 'Offer', 'Talks', 'EVENT'], ['North Korea', 'GPE', 'Open', 'Dialogue', 'COMM'], ['North Korea', 'GPE', 'Open', 'Possibility', 'PRODUCT'], ['North Korea', 'GPE', 'Push', 'Nuclear Warheads Production', 'ACT'], ['North Korea', 'GPE', 'Defy', 'U.N.

{'input': 'By Jeff John Roberts 2:03 PM EST .The new year has already brought some surprises on the cryptocurrency front, but the biggest one is about Ripple: In the last 24 hours, the currency has climbed around 25% to break $3 and lock up second place behind bitcoin. .Ripple’s recent run is remarkable in part because it has eclipsed Ethereum, which was long the number two digital currency, and considered to be the only real rival to bitcoin. .Here is a screenshot from Coinmarketcap that shows the new pecking order as of early Wednesday afternoon ET: .As you can see, Ripple now has a market cap of $120 billion—an amount that is nearly 35% higher than Ethereum, and worth nearly half that of bitcoin. It’s unclear what is driving the price surge, though interest from new hedge funds is likely one big reason. .Ripple’s emergence is also notable because, unlike other digital currencies on the list, it is not created by a decentralized mining process. Instead, Ripple’s currency supply—technically known as XRP—was created in one swoop, and a large portion is held by the company itself as a sort of treasury stock. .As CEO Brad Garlinghouse explained to Fortune this summer , Ripple is able to use its XRP supply as a strategic asset while it builds out its business of supplying banks with a blockchain-based source of liquidity. .The reaction to Ripple’s latest rise has been met with some grousing on Twitter by some who suggest it as a gimmick rather than a real digital currency: The “decentralized computer of the future”™ is overtaken by a fidget spinner. pic.twitter.com/kUf4tCgaXU .— Oleg Andreev (@oleganza) January 2, 2018 .Others note, however, that if Garlinghouse achieves Ripple’s goal of disrupting the existing global financial infrastructure, the consequences would be profound: If we suspend disbelief for a second and $XRP actually becomes a global reserve that is used as a bridge currency which disrupts correspondent banking, then Ripple will be the most successful company of all time. .— Ryan Selkis (@twobitidiot) January 3, 2018 And if we come back to the real world, this statement also shows you that the global financial institutions are not going to adopt someone elses bridge currency. If they do, Ripple will have showcased the negotiating prowess of a nation-state. .Thats mind-bending, so unlikely. https://t.co/57XyRwIHv5 .— Ryan Selkis (@twobitidiot) January 3, 2018 .The question on whether Ripple will ultimately be a world-changer, or simply an also-ran novelty, hinges in large part on whether banks adopt XRP as a so-called bridge currency to move money around. .Skeptics say this is unlikely because it is centralized and cannot provide enough liquidity compared to bitcoin. Garlinghouse, however, has argued that Ripple offers a faster and cheaper ledger system, and comes with less risk for banks than bitcoin. .Meanwhile, one obvious beneficiary of Ripple’s surge is co-founder Chris Larsen, who is now one of the richest men in the world (the $37 billion cited below is based on XRP trading at $2.39 so Larsen’s wealth is now even higher): Ripple co-founder Chris Larsen is now worth $37 billion due to his huge holdings of XRP (Ripples coin), making him the 15th richest American: https://t.co/wBNmLd5NrF pic.twitter.com/VYTOu4RQR4 .— Jeff Kauflin (@JeffKauflin) January 2, 2018 .In response to Ripple’s price surge, a company spokesperson provided the following statement: .In a year punctuated by the dramatic rise of digital assets, XRP has out performed the entire sector and looks likely to end the year up more than 45,000%. XRP’s performance is driven by a keen focus on solving a real global payments problem for real customers – and at fractions of a penny and about 3 seconds per transaction – it is cheaper, faster and more efficient than BTC or ETH. As others have pointed out, Bitcoin isn’t going to solve a payments problem when a transaction costs $40 and takes hours to complete. .The market seems to increasingly understand that there’s real utility for XRP in solving a massive cross-border payments and liquidity problem that is measured in the trillions of dollars. .For those interested in purchasing Ripple—to be clear, Fortune does not endorse buying XRP or any other digital currency— here is a guide for how to do so.

FILE PHOTO - Logo of German tyre company Continental is seen before the annual news conference in Hanover, Germany March 2, 2017. REUTERS/Fabian Bimmer .Germany’s three leading premium automakers BMW, Daimler and Volkswagen’s ( VOWG_p.DE ) Audi bought HERE for 2.8 billion euros (£2.49 billion) in 2015 from Finnish telecoms group Nokia to expand investments in autonomous-driving technology. .The three car companies are spending billions of euros on developing electric cars and software-based mobility services as tougher emission rules and connectivity are transforming the auto industry. .Continental said on Thursday it would sign a collaboration agreement with the Dutch provider of high-definition maps to pave the way for technologies that provide data for the efficient transportation of people and goods. .Software and electronics products are biggest drivers of growth at Hanover-based Continental which also makes fuel-injection systems and vehicle tyres. It plans to boost total sales to more than 50 billion euros by 2020 from 40.5 billion in 2016. FILE PHOTO - The Bosch logo is reflected in a semiconductor wafer in the company manufacturing base in Reutlingen, Germany, June 16, 2017. REUTERS/Michaela Rehle .Bosch’s statement on Thursday referred to plans by HERE to increase its diversification into non-automotive applications - a move that could help to offset risks surrounding the eventual arrival of fully autonomous cars for the mass market. .“Bosch is more than cars,” Chief Executive Volkmar Denner said in the statement. .He said the company saw synergies with data-based services for smart homes and smart cities - terms broadly describing the use of technology to find efficiencies everywhere from the factory floor to road traffic management. .Chip maker Intel also holds a 15 percent stake in HERE. A group of investors led by Chinese mapping firm Navinfo and internet giant Tencent in September cancelled a previously announced plan to buy 10 percent of HERE, after failing to win U.S. approval. .Both Bosch and Conti said they had agreed not to disclose how much they were paying for their stakes.

The London Stock Exchange Group offices are seen in the City of London, Britain, December 29, 2017. REUTERS/Toby Melville .Britains main stock index .FTSE dipped 0.1 percent, weighed down by financials stocks and consumer staples. .Next ( NXT.L ) shone, however, jumping 8 percent to the top of the index after its trading update surprised investors, with a sales beat driving the company to upgrade its full-year profit forecast. .Cheery results from the first UK retailer to report on the crucial Christmas season caused a rally in retail stocks across the market, delivering relief to investors in a sector faced with significant challenges. .Next’s update was in stark contrast to the start of 2017 when the retailer issued a profit warning and its shares sank. Wednesday gain brought it back to November levels before a third-quarter sales miss. .“The Next share price rollercoaster continues,” said Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets. .“Management’s update-by-update tinkering of guidance and sharp share price reactions only goes to reinforce how shareholders remain at the mercy of the UK consumer from one season to the next and exposed to short-termism.” .The main non-food retailers drove the market, with Marks & Spencer ( MKS.L ) up 2 percent while Primark owner ABF ( ABF.L ) gained 2.6 percent. .Mid and small-caps also jumped on the retail rally and the more domestically-focused indexes rose 0.2 percent each. .Fashion retailer N Brown ( BWNG.L ) rose 7 percent to the top of the FTSE 250 .FTMC , and shares in small-cap department store Debenhams ( DEB.L ) rose 3.8 percent. .Oil majors Royal Dutch Shell ( RDSa.L ) and BP ( BP.L ), still feeling the glow from a remarkably strong start to the year for crude prices, also delivered a boost. .But the FTSE 100 stayed negative as the weightier financials and consumer staples sectors wilted. .Heavyweights Diageo ( DGE.L ), Imperial Brands ( IMB.L ) and British American Tobacco ( BATS.L ) fell 0.5 to 1 percent.

But the league’s got to be stronger and say two days is not right,” West Brom manager Alan Pardew said. .West Ham’s televised fixture at Spurs was scheduled for New Year’s eve but moved because of safety concerns over the reduced capacity at underground stations around Wembley Stadium which meant the arena would only accommodate 43,000 spectators. .Asked if he was forced to make changes to his side because of the frequency of games, Pardew said: “Of course I am.

{'input': 'SAN MATEO, Calif., Jan. 03, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Incorta , the enterprise analytics platform that bypasses data modeling to deliver real-time insights straight from operational data, today announced two new executive hires: Karl Meyer as vice president of business development and Aran Nathanson as vice president of product..“2017 truly was a pivotal year for Incorta, and I’m happy to see that momentum carry into 2018 with these critical additions to our executive team,” said Osama Elkady, chief executive officer (CEO) of Incorta. “Karl’s straightforward, down-to-earth approach and broad experience with Silicon Valley startups already are paying dividends for our business development efforts. And, with Aran and his adventurous spirit, we gain a credible, influential product leader our engineers trust to task them with interesting, pertinent analytics challenges and also equip them with whatever means they need to overcome them.”.Meyer is a recognized leader in driving transformational change at Fortune 100 companies, possessing more than 20 years of experience with corporate strategy, business development, and product management at global technology firms as well as venture-backed startups. In this new role at Incorta, Meyer is focused on building a robust, multi-faceted partner ecosystem comprised of technology partners—hardware platforms, existing analytics players, and other large-scale enterprise applications—with whom Incorta’s technology will integrate; system integrators interested in embedding Incorta’s technology within their own solutions; and traditional go-to-market partners, such as resellers and distributors..Immediately prior to Incorta, Meyer founded and grew the enterprise business development function at leading venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins, and before that drove the strategy behind Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s hybrid cloud and advanced analytics transformation areas..“I’ve always believed business users know what they need to do—they just don’t have the data access or tools needed to do it,” said Meyer. “I ran one of the largest strategy teams at Hewlett Packard Enterprise, and one-third of my team’s time was wasted on rudimentary, non-strategic tasks related to locating, accessing, and attempting to understand key business data. Unfortunately, not much has changed since then. Even so-called data analytics innovations pitched to us when I was with Kleiner Perkins were merely companies finding new ways to copy data or hiring flocks of data scientists for increased manpower—they weren’t actually innovating a new concept. Incorta, on the other hand, is true advancement that will make possible a whole new set of analytics capabilities not even envisioned before. I’m excited to help Incorta’s experienced enterprise team develop a robust partner network that more quickly brings Incorta’s unique, game-changing analytics platform to a wider, global audience.”.As vice president of product, Nathanson is responsible for managing and translating stakeholder product requirements into manageable “chunks” that guide Incorta engineers on the strategic iteration of the analytics platform. Before Incorta, Nathanson co-founded, bootstrapped, and built to $5 million in annual revenue the advanced report generation, distribution, and scheduling application Vizubi, which sold for a substantial profit to data analytics platform Qlik in 2014. Post-acquisition, Nathanson led product strategy for the former Vizubi product (renamed QlikView NPrinting), increasing its annual revenue by more than five times in its first year..“I wanted to join a small, dynamic company that solves an interesting business problem, and Incorta met those requirements in spades,” said Nathanson. “The speed at which Incorta users can arrive at interesting insights is simply unheard of in the traditional enterprise analytics space. As an engineering organization, Incorta needs to match that kind of speed and agility via a structured, repeatable development process that efficiently delivers ongoing innovation and ever-expanding ease of use to Incorta customers. I’m extremely pleased to join Incorta’s experienced leadership team and look forward to working with its very talented engineers.”.Meyer holds a Bachelor of Arts in Mathematical Economics from Pomona College and also studied British Economic Policy at Oxford University. Nathanson holds a Bachelor of Arts in Biology from the University of Pennsylvania, and a Master of Business Administration in Finance and International Business from the NYU Stern School of Business..About Incorta.Incorta’s enterprise analytics platform aggregates complex business data in real-time, augmenting—or bypassing—the need for a traditional data warehouse. Powered by the industry’s first Direct Data Mapping TM engine, Incorta provides unprecedented query performance and eliminates costly join operations altogether. Incorta’s powerful software engine allows companies to go from transactional data directly to business analytics at speeds unheard of in the current analytics environment. Incorta reduces from months to days the time required to roll out new analytics applications, and reduces query and reporting times from hours to seconds..Innovative, fast-growth companies—including one of the three largest consumer electronics companies, one of the largest global social media companies, a top 10 private university , Broadcom , Shutterfly, and Toast —rely on Incorta to gain secure, sub-second access to meaningful business insight..Backed by GV (formerly Google Ventures) and Kleiner Perkins, Incorta is deployed in the Fortune 10, and powers analytics for some of the world’s largest and fastest-growing companies..To learn the fastest way to what matters, visit www.incorta.com or join the conversation on Twitter @incorta..Media Contact Emily Lewis emily.lewis@incorta.com.Source:Incorta, Inc.', 'output': "[['Incorta', 'COMP', 'Announce', 'Two New Executive Hires', 'ORG'], ['Incorta', 'COMP', 'Operate_In', 'Silicon Valley', 'GPE'], ['Karl Meyer', 'PERSON', 'Join', 'Incorta', 'COMP'], ['Karl Meyer', 'PERSON', 'Focused_On', 'Building Partner Ecosystem', 'ORG'], ['Karl Meyer', 'PERSON', 'Prior_To', 'Incorta', 'COMP', 'Founded', 'Enterprise Business Development Function', 'ORG', 'At', 'Kleiner Perkins', 'ORG/VENTURE_CAPITAL'], ['Karl Meyer', 'PERSON', 'Drive', 'Strategy', 'ORG', 'At', 'Hewlett Packard Enterprise', 'COMP'], ['Aran Nathanson', 'PERSON', 'Join', 'Incorta', 'COMP'], ['Aran Nathanson', 'PERSON', 'Responsible_For', 'Managing Product Requirements', 'ORG'], ['Aran Nathanson', 'PERSON', 'Co-Founded', 'Vizubi', 'COMP'], ['Vizubi', 'COMP', 'Sold', 'Qlik', 'COMP'], ['Aran Nathanson', 'PERSON', 'Led Product Strategy', 'ORG', 'For', 'Vizubi', 'COMP'], ['Aran Nathanson', 'PERSON', 'Holds', 'Master of Business Administration', 'CONCEPT', 'From', 'NYU Stern School of Business', 'ORG'], ['Incorta', 'COMP', 'Reduces', 'Time Required', 'TIME', 'To Roll Out New Analytics Applications', 'ORG'], ['Incorta', 'COMP', 'Reduces', 'Query and Reporting Times', 'TIME', 'From Hours to Seconds', 'TIME'], ['Incorta', 'COMP', 'Powers', 'Analytics', 'ORG', 'For', 'Some of the World’s Largest and Fastest-Growing Companies', 'COMP']]", 'category': 'closed_qa'}

Members of the Dalit community shout slogans as they block a road during a protest in Mumbai, India, January 3, 2018. REUTERS/Shailesh Andrade .Mumbai police advised people to avoid a number of key roads and intersections. Train services, the life line of the city, stalled throughout the day. .The Dalit call for a general strike across the western state of Maharashtra led to largely peaceful demonstrations. Police said protesters burned a few buses round the state, while dozens of buses and cars were damaged in Mumbai. .The Dalits, who rank at the bottom in India’s ancient caste hierarchy, called the strike in protest against an attack by right-wing groups in the city of Pune, 150 km (95 miles) from Mumbai, on Monday. .The attack came as the community was celebrating the 200th anniversary of a battle they won, fighting alongside British colonial forces, against an upper-caste ruler. A 28-year-old man was killed in the clashes, according to the state government. Policemen stand guard at a traffic junction in Mumbai, India, January 3, 2018. REUTERS/Danish Siddiqui .“The government didn’t arrest the perpetrators of violence in Pune. Hindu group members were beating Dalits and the police were just watching from afar,” said protester Sandeep Kamble. “We are demanding the arrest of the culprits.” .Thousands of Dalits hurled stones and caused traffic disruption across Mumbai on Tuesday. Dalits have been ostracised by upper-caste Hindus for centuries for doing jobs they deemed as impure, such as working in tanneries and as picking garbage.

They can join us or stay away,” said Prakash Ambedkar, a leader of the Dalit community. .In parts of the Mumbai suburb of Thane, officials banned the assembly of crowds, small or large. Schools were closed in some cities, while internet access was also limited. .Fleet taxis, along with cab hailing services like Uber and Ola, were also largely off the roads in Mumbai on Wednesday, while several offices asked employees to work from home.

{'input': 'DUBAI (Reuters) - Iranian authorities are concerned that nationwide unrest will undermine the clerical establishment and want to stamp out the protests quickly, senior government officials say. But the person with the most to lose is President Hassan Rouhani..While several senior officials said there was concern that prolonged unrest would damage the legitimacy and influence of the country’s religious leaders, few insiders see the unrest as an existential threat to that leadership, which has ruled since the 1979 revolution and is now controlled by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the ultimate authority in Iran’s system of dual clerical and republican rule..The biggest loser, they say, is likely to be Rouhani, who is much more closely tied to the country’s economic policies..“Of course Rouhani and his government will have less power afterwards, especially because his economic policy was criticized during the unrest,” said political analyst Hamid Farahvashian..“He will be a lame-duck president and Khamenei will have more power.”.Much of the protesters’ anger has focused on what Rouhani and his government have failed to deliver: an economic boom promised as the payoff for the 2015 deal that curbed Iran’s disputed nuclear program in return for world powers lifting sanctions..Protesters are angry that Iran’s youth unemployment rate is edging towards 30 percent, want higher wages and an end to alleged graft. They have chanted slogans against all of Iran’s leaders, including the clerical elite, and attacked police vehicles, banks and mosques as the unrest widened..“The continuation of the protests will lead to a legitimacy crisis,” said one senior official close to Rouhani, asking not to be named due to the sensitivity of the issue..“People have economic demands ... of course these demands should be taken seriously ... of course the establishment should listen to the people, but all these can be discussed in a calm atmosphere,” the official said..Some conservatives have pushed for a hardline approach, even though bloodshed could fuel more protests in the largest wave of demonstrations since nationwide unrest in 2009..“So far, security forces have not tried to prevent the demonstrations .... but this will change if (Khamenei) calls for an end to the street protests and demonstrators defy his call,” said one former Iranian official from the reformist camp..Even if the unrest is quelled, the demands of tens of thousands of restless working class youths who have taken to the streets are unlikely to dissipate..Khamenei spoke publicly for the first time about the crisis on Tuesday, accusing Iran’s enemies of stirring unrest but saying no more. A statement on his website said he would address the nation about the events “when the time is right”..THE LIMITS OF ROUHANI‘S POWER.Opponents of Iranian President Hassan Rouhani hold a protest outside the Iranian embassy in Rome, Italy, January 2, 2018. REUTERS/Tony Gentile The protesters have little chance of toppling the clerical leaders, who appear to be retaining control of the military, police, and security forces and have no compunction about using them, according to one U.S. official following the developments..Rouhani, who was elected in 2013, is more exposed. He is seen as a pragmatist at odds with Iran’s hardliners and has said in response to the protests that Iranians have a right to criticize the authorities..But he has a fight on his hands because of growing resentment over high prices and allegations of corruption..“His power is limited in Iran’s ruling system. Public discontent is increasing ... people are losing their faith in the establishment system,” a third Iranian official said. “The leaders are well aware of this fact and its dangerous consequences.”.U.S. officials fear the likeliest outcome of the protests is discrediting what one called Rouhani’s “moderate brand of moderation” and a harsher crackdown by the clerical authorities..“It’s an open question whether Rouhani ever intended to keep any of his promises, but he hasn’t delivered, especially on the economic front, and that means he has no popular support and is expendable to Khamenei,” said a second U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence matters..“He’s likely to be one of the casualties, though maybe not immediately.”.Rouhani has blamed his predecessor and the United States, Iran’s long-time adversary, for the economy’s shortcomings..But his government has also backtracked on planned fuel price rises and promised more jobs..Rouhani may need to spend more money to create more employment if he is to ease discontent, and could risk antagonizing powerful interests if he tries to address allegations of corruption..His vulnerability and the deep divisions in Iran’s hierarchy have fueled suspicions among some of his sympathizers that conservative rivals may have played a hand in the crisis..“It was a coup against Rouhani and his achievements ... The aim was to harm Rouhani,” said Saeed Leylaz, a political analyst close to the pro-reform movement..But a fourth official in Tehran said the nationwide protests had united Iran’s leadership..“At this point it is not important whether a political faction initiated the unrest to harm the rival group,” the official said..“The unrest was hijacked by our enemies ... that is why all factions have united to protect the Islamic Republic.”.Additional reporting by John Walcott in Washington and Andrew Torchia in Dubai; Writing by Michael Georgy; Editing by Nick Tattersall.

Mr. Jacobovitz, who most recently served for nearly five years as Chief Executive Officer of the American College of Cardiology (ACC), a 52,000-member non-profit medical society dedicated to transforming cardiovascular care and improving heart health, has also been appointed to serve as a director on CiVi’s Board of Directors. Prior to his role at the ACC, Mr. Jacobovitz was President of Actelion Pharmaceuticals Ltd., a biopharmaceutical company focused on developing treatments for pulmonary arterial hypertension that was acquired by Johnson & Johnson in 2017 for $30 billion, for around 10 years..“We are extremely pleased to welcome Shal to CiVi Biopharma,” said Aaron Davis, Chief Executive Officer of Boxer Capital, and Executive Chairman of CiVi Biopharma. “As CiVi prepares to dose the first patient in January 2018 in its phase I clinical trial for the Company’s lead product candidate, CiVi007, a long-acting PCSK9 inhibitor being developed for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia and the prevention of cardiovascular disease, Shal’s vast knowledge of the treatment landscape for cardiovascular diseases will play a critical role in the Company’s future development plans. In addition, having served in various leadership roles in multiple healthcare-related settings, including as Chief Executive Officer of the ACC and President of Actelion Pharmaceuticals, Shal is uniquely positioned to lead CiVi’s next phase of growth.”.Mr. Jacobovitz served as Chief Executive Officer of the ACC from April 2013 through January 2018. In this role, he supported the development of the society’s strategic vision, led the ACC’s senior executive leadership team to ensure this strategy was appropriately executed on and represented the organization’s interests before key policy making bodies. In addition, Mr. Jacobovitz forged and cultivated strong relationships with other healthcare-related organizations globally to advance the mission of the ACC, and was responsible for the society’s fiscal health and the achievement of its budgetary goals. As President of Actelion, he was a member of the company’s business strategic management operating team responsible for developing and implementing Actelion’s corporate strategy globally. During this time, Mr. Jacobovitz helped grow the company’s revenues from $70 million to $950 million. He was also responsible for the business development and investor relations functions at Actelion. Prior to this, Mr. Jacobovitz served in increasingly senior positions at F. Hoffman LaRoche, from 1996-2003..Mr. Jacobovitz received his B.S. in Biology from the University of Western Ontario, London, ON, Canada..“I am very excited by the significant opportunity for CiVi to transform the treatment of cardiovascular diseases with PCSK9 therapies,” said Mr. Jacobovitz. “While novel PCSK9 inhibitors have generated compelling data to date, patient compliance and prohibitively high pricing remain as significant challenges for this promising class of drugs. Based on the profile of CiVi007 and previously generated pre-clinical data, our lead compound has the potential to lead to less frequent dosing and, therefore, greater patient compliance. In addition, due to the lower cost of goods associated with our third-generation antisense approach, we will have the opportunity to offer a reduced pricing model. We look forward to entering the clinic with CiVi007 very shortly, and to the availability of data from this phase I trial in mid-2018.”.About CiVi Biopharma.CiVi Biopharma Inc. is a US-based, privately-held biopharmaceutical company, founded in 2016. The Companys research and development activities are focused on creating novel therapies against cardiovascular and liver diseases. CiVi’s innovative pipeline includes CiVi007, a long-acting PCSK9 third-generation Locked Nucleic Acid antisense molecule being developed for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia and the prevention of cardiovascular disease.

{'input': 'ARVADA, Colo., Jan. 03, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Minuteman Press International, the worlds largest and #1 rated marketing and printing franchise by Entrepreneur, is proud to welcome the new full-service Minuteman Press center in Arvada, Colorado to its growing franchise family. The Arvada marketing and printing franchise was successfully converted from an independent print shop to Minuteman Press as part of Minuteman Press Internationals ongoing conversion program ..Dwayne Cameron (3rd from left) owns the newly converted Minuteman Press printing franchise in Arvada, Colorado..Our conversion program enables independent printers who are looking to sell a printing business to find a reputable and trusted partner in Minuteman Press International, says Bob Titus, Minuteman Press International President and CEO. He adds, As printing industry leaders for over 40 years, we have the experience to provide a full valuation of independent print businesses as well as provide guidance and expertise in selling their business. In addition, we have the unique ability to attract a wider pool of qualified buyers for sellers because we provide full training and ongoing local support to all of our franchisees. This means that buyers do not have to have printing industry experience since we will be there for them every step of the way..Arvada, Colorado – Meet Dwayne Cameron.Dwayne Cameron owns his new Minuteman Press printing franchise located at 5840 Olde Wadsworth Blvd., Arvada, CO 80003. Prior to becoming a business owner, Dwayne had several professional experiences in sales across various industries that led him to Minuteman Press. Dwayne explains, After graduating college in the mid-1990s, I went to work for Office Depot as a business-to-business sales representative. I worked for Office Depot for about 5 years and spent another 4 years in the industry before I was asked manage a small family-owned commercial plumbing business. I helped grow that business over the course of 3-4 years, and then I went to work as a manufacturers representative in the office furniture industry. I specifically sold furniture to the Federal Government under a government contract. My sales territory covered four states in which I traveled about 50% of the time. The contract was re-negotiated and my position was eliminated in late 2016..Why Minuteman Press? Dwayne answers, Also in late 2016, the Franchise Business Show was in Denver, so knowing I would be going through a change I decided I would look into it. My attitude was wide open as I walked through the show. Seeing many restaurant and bar franchises, I quickly knew that the food industry was not something I was familiar with and not the direction I wanted to go. Minuteman Press caught my eye because the workday was similar to my work experience in both selling and managing a small business..Dwayne also liked Minuteman Press because of their focus on providing outstanding customer service in addition to their longevity in franchising as well as their strong brand identity. He explains, I was tired of working for The Man. Most of the companies I had worked for did not seem to want to take care of their customers and gave poor customer service that made me feel disheartened about going back to represent another company like that. Minuteman Press specifically noted that customer service and sending out a quality product was a key to being successful which was something I truly believe in. I spoke with many different business-to-business concepts, but overall the strength of Minuteman Press internationally, with the overall number of stores reaching close to 1000 and being a franchisor for over 40 years was the main reason I chose Minuteman Press..For more information on Minuteman Press in Arvada, Colorado, contact Dwayne and his team at (303) 940-9779 or visit their website: http://arvada-co.minutemanpress.com.I am thrilled to welcome Dwayne Cameron as a new Minuteman Press franchise owner, says Jack Panzer, Minuteman Press International Regional Vice President for the Colorado region.

A ruling by the court on the case was due this week. .British Airways’ owner IAG said last Friday it would buy Niki for 20 million euros ($24 million) and provide up to 16.5 million euros in additional liquidity to the company. .The sale to IAG, which had been in exclusive talks to acquire the airline, appeared to mark the final chapter in the demise of Air Berlin, the former No.2 German air carrier that earlier owned Niki. .Fairplane argues however that Niki, which is registered in as a company in Austria, had been profitable but had lost access to bridge financing when insolvency proceedings were opened in Germany in December, grounding planes and stranding passengers. .Spokesman Ronald Schmid said that dragging Niki into the German insolvency process was wrong, and that passengers stood a better chance of getting their money back in the Austrian courts. .“We want to ensure that the insolvency is carried out in Austria - where it belongs - so that there are no conflicts of interest,” Schmid told Reuters. .IAG declined to comment. .In appointing Floether to liquidate Air Berlin in December, a German insolvency judge was of the opinion that, although Niki was registered as a company in Austria, its center of main interest was in fact in Germany.

The action, which was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, alleges that the Company violated federal securities laws..In particular, the complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that (1) TIOs data security program was inadequate to safeguard the personally identifiable information of its users; (2) the vulnerabilities threatened continued operation of TIOs platform; (3) PayPal’s revenues derived from its TIO services were thus unsustainable; (4) consequently, PayPal had overstated the benefits of the TIO Acquisition; and (5) as a result, PayPal’s public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times. On November 10, 2017, PayPal suspended its TIO services, pending a security review, stating that it had discovered security vulnerabilities on the TIO platform and that the TIO data security program did not meet PayPal’s standards.

{'input': 'Atkins wants you to think lifestyle, not diet, this new year..The brand that popularized cutting carbs to lose weight wants to tap the growing number of Americans who say theyre focused on improving their health instead of simply shedding pounds. These so-called lifestylers are people who may buy Atkins shakes and bars but dont necessarily follow the plan, said chief marketing officer Scott Parker..Atkins picked actor Rob Lowe, who portrayed health-obsessed Chris Traeger on NBCs Parks and Recreation, as the face of its latest campaign. Hes the first male to represent the brand and someone who has managed his weight with Atkins for years. The ads tout the program as one thats not measured in pounds or ounces, a departure from traditional diet marketing..Atkins, which was acquired last summer by Conyers Park Acquisition to form Simply Good Foods , has already been trying to revamp its image to attract more people. It has added a plan that allowed 40 grams of carbs per day, in addition to the classic 20-grams-per-day regimen. Last month, it introduced a 100-carb-per-day option in its latest book Eat Right, Not Less..I think this is the final step, where we bring in Rob as a spokesman who hasnt had a weight issue or hasnt lost weight but will say its absolutely critical to his energy level and vitality, Parker said. This is the final bold step, and I think it makes sense with the steps weve taken in the last three years..Atkins is one of several traditional diet brands that have tried to reinvent themselves. Weight Watchers introduced a program last month called WW FreeStyle thats more flexible than previous programs. Spokeswoman Oprah Winfrey says on the companys website: WW Freestyle is not a diet. Its a way of living..Wall Street has rewarded Weight Watchers efforts. Shares skyrocketed 300 percent last year and received another boost Tuesday when DJ Khaled became its first social media ambassador..January has historically been a rough month for the company even though its prime health season with people focused on their newly minted New Years resolutions. Over the past 10 years, Weight Watchers has been one of the worst performers of health and fitness related stocks, seeing an average return of minus 10 percent in January and trading negative 60 percent of the time, according to Kensho..Yet even as these brands pivot, they still havent entirely dropped the word diet and their promises to help customers lose weight. Theyre still sprinkled into web materials, alongside more on-trend buzzwords..Nutrisystem s South Beach Diet website advertises losing weight within weeks. Its packaging takes a slightly different approach, saying its designed for clean eating and optimal health..Atkins has also redesigned its packaging on its bars and shakes to make the brand imagery more contemporary, Parker said. Its efforts are all aligned with the goal of casting a wider net beyond dieters..Disclosure: NBC and CNBC are owned by Comcasts NBCUniversal unit..Correction: An earlier version misstated who owns Atkins.

It is also the first time since 2014 that Brent opened a year above $60 a barrel..Traders said Tuesdays prices dips were due to the full return of the 450,000 bpd capacity Forties pipeline system in the North Sea, as well as ongoing repairs at a Libyan pipeline, which had cut output there by 70,000 bpd to 100,000 bpd..Global oil markets have been supported by a year of production cuts led by the Middle East-dominated Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and Russia. The cuts started in January 2017 and are scheduled to cover all of 2018..Strong demand growth, especially from China, has also been supporting crude..Oil inventories have been declining since March 2017 and OPEC have agreed to extend production cuts until the end of 2018 so it is probably uncontroversial to say that the fundamental outlook for oil has improved since the beginning of 2017, said William OLoughlin, investment analyst at Australias Rivkin Securities..On the other hand, the higher prices are expected to stoke U.S. shale output, he said..U.S. commercial crude oil inventories have fallen by almost 20 percent from their historic highs last March, to 431.9 million barrels..U.S. oil production <C-OUT-T-EIA> has risen by almost 16 percent since mid-2016, to 9.75 million bpd at the end of last year..However, consultancy Rystad Energy said U.S. crude oil production capacity has reached 10 million barrels per day..(Reporting by Henning Gloystein; editing by Richard Pullin)', 'output': "[['Brent', 'FIN_INSTRUMENT', 'Begin', '$60', 'ECON_INDICATOR'], ['WTI Crude', 'FIN_INSTRUMENT', 'Begin', '$60', 'ECON_INDICATOR'], ['OPEC', 'ORG', 'Supply_Cuts', 'None', 'None'], ['Russia', 'GPE', 'Supply_Cuts', 'None', 'None'], ['Oil Prices', 'FIN_INSTRUMENT', 'Supported', 'None', 'None'], ['U.S.', 'GPE', 'Production', '10 mln bpd', 'ECON_INDICATOR'], ['Rystad', 'ORG', 'State', '10 mln bpd', 'ECON_INDICATOR'], ['U.S. Production Capacity', 'ECON_INDICATOR', 'Reach', '10 mln bpd', 'ECON_INDICATOR'], ['Forties Pipeline System', 'ORG', 'Return', 'None', 'None'], ['Libyan Pipeline', 'ORG', 'Repairs', 'None', 'None'], ['Global Oil Markets', 'CONCEPT', 'Supported', 'None', 'None'], ['OPEC', 'ORG', 'Production_Cuts', 'All of 2018', 'TIME'], ['Russia', 'GPE', 'Production_Cuts', 'All of 2018', 'TIME'], ['China', 'GPE', 'Support', 'None', 'None'], ['Oil Inventories', 'CONCEPT', 'Decline', 'None', 'None'], ['OPEC', 'ORG', 'Agree', 'Extend Production Cuts', 'ACTION'], ['End of 2018', 'TIME', 'Until', 'None', 'None'], ['Higher Prices', 'ECON_INDICATOR', 'Expected', 'Stoke', 'ACTION'], ['U.S. Shale Output', 'SECTOR', 'Stoked', 'None', 'None'], ['U.S. Commercial Crude Oil Inventories', 'CONCEPT', 'Fall', 'Almost 20%', 'PERCENT'], ['U.S. Oil Production', 'SECTOR', 'Rise', 'Almost 16%', 'PERCENT'], ['U.S. Crude Oil Production Capacity', 'CONCEPT', 'Reach', '10 mln bpd', 'ECON_INDICATOR']]", 'category': 'closed_qa'}

It was not clear whether the three churches provided aid to victims. .The churches that sued are the Rockport First Assembly of God in Rockport, which lost its roof and steeple and suffered other structural damage, and the Harvest Family Church in Cypress and Hi-Way Tabernacle in Cleveland, which were both flooded. .In a complaint filed in federal court in Houston, the churches said they would like to apply for aid but it would be “futile” because FEMA’s public assistance program “categorically” excluded their claims, violating their constitutional right to freely exercise their religion. .They said FEMA’s ban on providing relief where at least half a building’s space is used for religious purposes, a policy also enforced after Hurricane Katrina in 2005 and Hurricane Sandy in 2012, contradicted a recent U.S. Supreme Court decision making it easier for religious groups to get public aid.

The logo of BP is seen at a petrol station in Kloten, Switzerland October 3, 2017. REUTERS/Arnd Wiegmann .The British oil and gas company said on Tuesday the cut in U.S. corporate income tax from 35 percent to 21 percent was expected to positively impact its U.S. earnings in the long run. .But in the short term, lower tax rates would affect its deferred tax assets and liabilities, resulting in a one-off, non-cash charge of $1.5 billion to its fourth quarter results which are due to be announced on Feb. 8, it said. .“The ultimate impact of the change in the U.S. corporate income tax rate is subject to a number of complex provisions in the legislation which BP is reviewing,” BP said in a statement. .Deferred tax assets refer in some cases to a company overpaying taxes in advance and then getting them back in the form of tax relief. .BP has large operations in oil and gas production in the Gulf of Mexico and onshore shale operations as well as refineries that can process up to 746,000 barrels per day of crude oil, according to its website. .Shell ( RDSa.L ) said last week it would incur a one-off charge of $2-$2.5 billion, although the new legislation would have a “favorable” impact on earnings. .On Dec. 22, President Donald Trump signed the $1.5 trillion tax overhaul into law, cutting tax rates for businesses and offering some temporary cuts for some individuals and families.

{'input': 'BETHESDA, Md., Jan. 02, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- India Globalization Capital, Inc. (NYSE-MKT:IGC) provides compelling in vivo data compiled from genetically engineered mice to mimic Alzheimer’s shows marked improvement in spatial memory..Scope of Studies.Transgenic mice with a gene introduced to mimic Alzheimer’s were used to gauge the impact of IGC-AD1 on learning and memory function. A common model used to study learning and memory behavior in mice is the Morris Water Maze (MWM) test, which specifically evaluates spatial learning and memory. As with many of the results previously disclosed, Dr. Chuanhai Cao, IGC’s Senior Advisor and Associate Professor of Pharmaceutical Sciences at USF’s College of Pharmacy conducted the studies..Analysis.The MWM study showed that mice treated with IGC-AD1 at various doses exhibited significantly decreased learning trial errors, and markedly decreased escape latency times as compared with the control groups. For example, normal mice with no Alzheimer’s markers took approximately 2 seconds to resolve the MWM, while mice with Alzheimer’s markers took approximately 8 seconds. Alzheimer’s disease model mice treated with the medication took approximately 4 seconds, an improvement of approximately 50% over the control group of untreated Alzheimer’s model mice. “This is exciting as it holds the potential for improvement in spatial memory and short-term memory among Alzheimer’s patients. “A common endpoint of Alzheimer’s is patients getting lost, or not being able to find their way home,” said Ram Mukunda, CEO of IGC..2018 Key Objectives.“We are preparing the groundwork necessary to get Hyalolex, our lead product formulation for Alzheimer’s ready for Phase 2-B human trials. Independent of this, we expect to make the product available through medical dispensaries in select states of the U.S. In addition, we are working on addressing issues specific to the medical cannabis industry such as transactional difficulties, inadequate product labeling, product identification assurance (PIA) and product origin assurance (POA), using distributed ledgers inherent in blockchain technology. We are ready for an exciting 2018,” concluded Mr. Mukunda..About MWM.MWM evaluates learning, memory and factors that influence visual acuity, motor function, and motivation. In the MWM task, the animal is required to discover a hidden platform to escape from swimming in a pool of water. To accomplish this task, the animal forms a “spatial orientation map” in the brain using visual stimuli from extra-maze cues in the testing room. During training, learning is assessed by the amount of time elapsed before the animal climbs onto the platform to escape the water (escape latency) and by the percentage of time or path length spent in the quadrant housing the platform (target quadrant) as well as a number of errors that occur in each trial. This is a test of cognitive function..About Alzheimer’s Disease.Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is a form of dementia. It is known as America’s most expensive disease, with an estimated cost to the U.S. economy of $236 billion. AD currently affects more than 5.3 million Americans and over 65% of AD patients are women. Over the next 20 years, the number of those afflicted with the disease is expected to double. The forecast is staggering, considering that to date, no effective cure has been found..About IGC.IGC has two lines of business, a legacy infrastructure business and a cannabis pharmaceutical business that has developed a lead product for treating Alzheimer’s patients. The Company recently announced that it is working on using blockchain to address issues specific to the cannabis industry including transactional difficulties, product labeling, product identification assurance (PIA), and product origin assurance (POA).

{'input': 'January 2, 2018 / 9:54 AM / Updated an hour ago Australian IPOs set to rebound this year, raise up to $7.8 billion: bankers Paulina Duran 5 Min Read .SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian IPO fundraising could double this year to around A$10 billion ($7.84 billion) from five-year lows in 2017, with firms such as Deutsche Bank-backed Latitude Financial poised to capitalize on rallying markets and investor craving for big deals. .Bankers around the world are looking to the global stock market rally of the past year to kick-start a series of big floats and spin-offs, following years of caution and balance sheet repair by companies that led to a lackluster market for initial public offerings (IPOs). .New floats in Sydney last year raised just $3.9 billion - the lowest since 2012, Thomson Reuters data shows as debt-fuelled foreign buyers snapped up companies that could otherwise have pursued a listing. .“We could reach the A$8 billion to A$10 billion mark,” said Richard Sleijpen, UBS head of equity capital markets, of the 2018 pipeline. “Speculated, announced and strategic review processes suggest very strong IPO volumes for this year.” .Expected deals include mortgage provider Latitude Financial, partly owned by Deutsche Bank ( DBKGn.DE ) and KKR & Co. LP ( KKR.N ). The company is valued at about A$5 billion and last month appointed lead managers to help raise about A$2 billion, according to two sources who declined to be identified because the plans are private. .Latitude’s senior executives did not immediately reply to an emailed request for comment on the company’s IPO plans. Group Treasurer Paul Varro did not immediately return a voice message left after office hours. .Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) ( CBA.AX ) is also considering an IPO of its asset management business - Colonial First State Global Asset Management (CFSGAM) - as part of a series of divestments. It sold its insurance unit to AIA Group ( 1299.HK ) in September. .CFSGAM has A$219 billion in assets under management and could be listed to raise about A$3 billion this year, the sources said. .Vodafone Group ( VOD.L ) is also planning to spin off its New Zealand subsidiary in a deal expected to raise about A$1 billion, the sources added. .CBA and Vodafone have said previously they are exploring listing their units. A Vodafone spokeswoman said on Tuesday no final decision had been taken on an IPO for the New Zealand unit. A CBA spokesman said the bank continued to review its options for the unit but declined to confirm the size of the potential float. .“The investment community has been starved of IPOs of well established businesses - that is one of the main reasons why we see a very strong demand for listings in 2018,” said one senior banker who declined to be identified because the banker was not authorized to speak with the media. .Origin Energy Ltd ( ORG.AX ) sold its gas assets to Beach Energy for $1.25 billion, after actively exploring a listing of the business last year. .Another disappointment came from TPG Capital Management which was working towards a listing of Alinta Energy but opted to sell to Hong Kong conglomerate Chow Tai Fook Enterprises for nearly A$4 billion. .UBS’s Sleijpen said that in some cases last year, the sellers viewed outright sales as more certain than the IPO market, but added that equity market dynamics had changed. .“Investor sentiment is quite bullish going into 2018, and that has been fueled by a more stable market – as we haven’t seen the kind of volatility that we saw leading into 2017 – and the prospect of synchronized global growth, where most economies are in a reasonably good position to continue to grow this year,” he said. .Australia’s ASX 200 rose 7 per cent last year, its best performance since 2013, as a surge in commodity prices lifted miners, helping offset a subdued performance by the country’s biggest banks and insurers.

{'input': 'SHARES Getty Images | Justin Sullivan .Alphabet s Google is exploring a potential sale of Zagat, the U.S. restaurant review guide which the search giant bought for $151 million in 2011, people familiar with the matter said. .A sale of Zagat would mark a course reversal for Alphabets once ambitious plans for the brand, spearheaded by former Google executive Marissa Mayer, who went on to become Yahoos chief executive. Zagat gradually became less of a priority as Google focused on drawing traffic to its Google+ social network. .Google has held informal talks in recent months with multiple companies about offloading Zagat, the sources said, asking not to be named because the matter is private. Any deal would likely involve the Zagat brand name and website, the sources added. .Googles asking price is not known, and there is no certainty it will agree to sell Zagat, the sources said. .A spokeswoman for Google declined to comment. .Google Maps incorporates Zagat reviews into its restaurant listings, and a small team at the company maintains Zagat.com, which features articles about restaurants in major cities. .The unit makes up just a fraction of Alphabet, a sprawling holding company whose units include Google and an array of unrelated pursuits in areas such as healthcare, self-driving cars and urban planning. .Founded in 1979 by Tim and Nina Zagat, the eponymous service became known for its familiar burgundy pocket-sized guides to restaurants in cities around the world. Many establishments feature Zagat stickers on their doors and windows. .Over the past year, Alphabet has been pruning its portfolio and shedding smaller non-core assets. .Last June, Alphabet agreed to sell two robotics firms, Boston Dynamics and Tokyo-based Schaft to SoftBank. Last February, it announced it would sell the satellite imaging business it acquired in 2014 for $500 million called Terra Bella, to Planet Labs, a San Francisco-based private satellite operator. .Alphabet also explored selling Nest, a maker of Wi-Fi enabled thermostats, in 2016, Reuters reported.

{'input': ' 00 AM / Updated 23 minutes ago U.S. judge orders government to release Iraqis or grant bond hearings Yeganeh Torbati 3 Min Read .WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. judge ordered the government on Tuesday to either release Iraqi immigrants it arrested last year or grant them bond hearings, in the latest judicial curb on the Trump administration’s efforts to tighten U.S. immigration. FILE PHOTO: Protesters rally outside the federal court just before a hearing to consider a class-action lawsuit filed on behalf of Iraqi nationals facing deportation, in Detroit, Michigan, U.S., June 21, 2017. REUTERS/Rebecca Cook/File Photo .Last year the federal government detained hundreds of Iraqi immigrants who had been ordered deported years ago due to criminal convictions. Iraq until recently had refused to take them back, but struck a deal with the United States in March to repatriate its citizens, sparking the immigration sweeps. .The Iraqis and civil rights groups representing them sued the federal government. U.S. District Judge Mark Goldsmith, in Detroit, had previously halted the deportation of the Iraqis, many of whom are Christian, who argued they would face persecution if they were sent back to Iraq. .In his ruling on Tuesday, Goldsmith said that any of the Iraqis held for six months or longer must either be released or granted a bond hearing before an immigration judge within 30 days. .“Our legal tradition rejects warehousing human beings while their legal rights are being determined,” wrote Goldsmith. .The Trump administration has tried to deport the Iraqis as part of its push to increase immigration enforcement and make countries, which have resisted in the past, take back nationals ordered deported from the United States. [nL1N1J91RT] .Since June, immigration enforcement officers have detained approximately 300 Iraqi nationals with final deportation orders, according to information provided to the court by the Iraqis’ lawyers. There are approximately 1,400 Iraqis in the United States with final deportation orders. .The U.S. government said in March that Iraq had agreed to repatriate Iraqi nationals ordered deported from the United States. .But Goldsmith noted in his order that the United States has “no written agreement” with Iraq regarding its cooperation, and that it is therefore unclear whether Iraq had agreed to take back all its nationals, and if so, under what conditions. .Goldsmith said his ruling would apply to Iraqi detainees in similar circumstances nationwide, even if they are not involved in the litigation. .“(Goldsmith) just really reaffirmed the principle that indefinite detention in this country is not acceptable,” said Kary Moss, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Michigan, which is representing the Iraqis. .The Department of Justice, which is arguing on behalf of the government, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

{'input': 'As the leaders of the U.S. and North Korea sparred on whos nuclear button is bigger, there was still hope rare talks between the two Koreas could bring a thaw in relations..Yet, analysts say its unlikely such talks would end the nuclear threat from North Korea. It could, however, ease tensions during the upcoming PyeongChang Winter Olympics in South Korea and reduce the chance of an escalation that might lead to a larger crisis, analysts said..In a New Years Day speech, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un said he was open to dialogue with Seoul and indicated that the North might send a delegation to the upcoming Winter Olympics, which begin Feb. 9..On Tuesday, the Seoul government proposed talks could be held in the inter-Korean truce village of Panmunjom on Jan. 9, according to the Yonhap News Agency ..We should take it seriously partly because he [Kim] is trying to drive a wedge between the United States and South Korea, said Matthew Bunn, a nuclear proliferation expert and professor of practice at Harvard Universitys John F. Kennedy School of Government..Some experts believe the outreach from Pyongyang is ultimately an attempt to cause friction in the Seoul-Washington relationship and undermine sanctions, as well as to disrupt plans for the upcoming Foal Eagle and Key Resolve U.S.-South Korea joint military exercises..The war games, which North Korea has seen over the years as a war rehearsal, involve navy ships, tanks and aircraft as well as live-fire exercises and tens of thousands of troops. They are scheduled to start in March..AFP | Getty Images North Korean soldiers stare at South Korean soldiers at the truce village of Panmunjom in the Demilitarized zone (DMZ) dividing the two Koreas on November 27, 2017. What hes saying, in essence, is something some of us have been expecting for a while: Ive got my deterrent now, so now I am prepared to talk, said Bunn, who worked on nuclear issues in the Bill Clinton administration..Meantime, analysts say Kims message to Washington about having the nuclear button on his desk should be viewed as a sign the regime wont give up its intercontinental ballistic missiles or nuclear weapons. Some believe Kim, who turns 34 years old next week, could have assembly lines going for his new ICBMs this year..Late Tuesday, President Donald Trump tweeted he too has the nuclear button and said it happens to be much bigger and more powerful than one the North Korean leader has on his desk — and Trump boasted my Button works!.https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/948355557022420992.Several times in Kims speech he emphasized the fact that they are a strong nation because of nuclear weapons, said Lisa Collins, a fellow with the Korea Chair at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a defense think tank. She said the North Korean leaders reference to the nuclear button shouldnt be viewed as a threat, but hes making very clear again that he will not be giving up his nuclear weapons..Last year, North Korea test-launched at least three ICBM missiles, including a Hwasong-15 in late November that some experts believe can reach all of the U.S. mainland. Also, the rogue nation conducted its sixth underground nuclear test in September and threatened to do an atmospheric nuclear blast but so far hasnt done so..On Tuesday, NBC News Pentagon correspondent Hans Nichols reported that another missile launch by Pyongyang is possible, if not likely, in the coming days, citing several military officials..Collins said the data theyve collected at CSIS shows that theres usually a downtick in missile testing in the winter months — November, December and January — and then usually in the early spring and summer is when theres an increase in North Korean missile tests. So I would anticipate the same pattern happening again this year in 2018 if there is no fundamental strategic change in the environment..The Pentagon declined to comment..Analysts say the fact Kim delivered the New Years message in a Western-style suit rather than his usual Maoist attire may be an attempt to humanize him, especially to U.S. and Asian audiences. However, one U.S. expert believes that effort was a complete failure..Unfortunately, he came off looking more like a gangster than he did a sort of normal Westernized businessman or presidential leader, said Harry Kazianis, director of defense studies at the Center for the National Interest, a think tank founded by former President Richard Nixon..Regardless, Bunn said Kim probably wants to talk first with the South Koreans because he sees a more cooperative leader in Seoul than in Washington. He also believes its an opportunity to reduce tensions on the peninsula, which were getting to the point where there was a real risk of inadvertently blundering into war..In response to Mondays olive branch from Kim, South Koreas president, Moon Jae-in, said he welcomed the news and possibility to turn the games into a groundbreaking chance to improve South-North relations and establish peace..At the same time, South Koreas prime minister, Lee Nak-yon, was Quote: d as saying North Korea might now demand different treatment in discussions , Yonhap reported..Lee didnt elaborate on what different treatment may mean, but it apparently indicates that the communist nation could demand the South treat it as a nuclear weapons-armed state, the South Korean news agency reported..Talks could involve a North Korean team participating in the upcoming PyeongChang Winter Olympic Games, which will be held about 50 miles from the border that divides the two Koreas..My question is what do the North Koreans want, said Kazianis. Every time North Korea comes to the table, they always want something for it..One possibility is that North Korea may want the U.S. and South Korea to weaken sanctions, although thats unlikely to get any support from the Trump administration..Indeed, Trump on Tuesday morning tweeted: Sanctions and other pressures are beginning to have a big impact on North Korea..https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/948194400114487296.United Nations Security Council sanctions against North Korea are wide-ranging on trade and limit exports on such things as textiles, seafood and coal but also cut back oil and gasoline imports. Even so, Reuters last week reported that there have been at least three cases of Russian tankers in recent months transferring oil at sea for North Korea ..Kazianis said the South Koreans are in a bind with the Olympics. The North Koreans have a lot of ways to make the Olympics go very bad..So, I think Kim Jong Un probably realizes this and probably will go to the South Koreans on Jan. 9 and say, Look, Im looking for sanctions relief or food aid or access to oil or something like that, Kazianis said. The South Koreans might actually give it to him because they dont want to have billions of dollars in investment in the Winter Games be wrecked by, say, a North Korea nuclear test, an ICBM test or even some cyber-strikes..Even if Kim may appear to have the short-term leverage, though, experts say there are plenty of reasons to be wary..Theres good reason to have skepticism about this offer by Kim Jong Un because of the timing,', 'output': "[['U.S.', 'GPE', 'Spar', 'North Korea', 'GPE', 'Nuclear Button'], ['North Korea', 'GPE', 'Indicate', 'Delegation', 'Noun', 'Winter Olympics'], ['Seoul', 'GPE', 'Propose', 'Talks', 'Noun', 'Jan. 9'], ['North Korea', 'GPE', 'Operate_In', 'Demilitarized Zone', 'GPE'], ['Kim Jong Un', 'PERSON', 'Open', 'Dialogue', 'Noun', 'Seoul'], ['Pyongyang', 'GPE', 'Outreach', 'Noun', 'Seoul-Washington Relationship'], ['North Korea', 'GPE', 'Undermine', 'Sanctions', 'Noun'], ['North Korea', 'GPE', 'Disrupt', 'U.S.-South Korea Joint Military Exercises', 'Noun'], ['North Korea', 'GPE', 'Emphasize', 'Nuclear Weapons', 'Noun'], ['North Korea', 'GPE', 'Test-Launch', 'ICBM Missiles', 'Noun'], ['North Korea', 'GPE', 'Conduct', 'Underground Nuclear Test', 'Noun'], ['North Korea', 'GPE', 'Threaten', 'Atmospheric Nuclear Blast', 'Noun'], ['Pyongyang', 'GPE', 'Possible', 'Missile Launch', 'Noun'], ['North Korea', 'GPE', 'Deliver', 'New Year Message', 'Noun'], ['North Korea', 'GPE', 'Humanize', 'Himself', 'Pronoun'], ['Kim Jong Un', 'PERSON', 'Fail', 'Humanize', 'Verb'], ['Kim Jong Un', 'PERSON', 'Want', 'Talk', 'Verb', 'Seoul'], ['Moon Jae-in', 'PERSON', 'Welcome', 'News', 'Noun'], ['North Korea', 'GPE', 'Participate', 'Winter Olympic Games', 'Noun'], ['North Korea', 'GPE', 'Demand', 'Different Treatment', 'Noun'], ['North Korea', 'GPE', 'Treat', 'Nuclear Weapons-Armed State', 'Noun'], ['North Korea', 'GPE', 'Want', 'Weaken Sanctions', 'Verb'], ['Trump Administration', 'ORG', 'Unlikely', 'Support', 'Verb', 'Weaken Sanctions'], ['United Nations Security Council', 'ORG', 'Sanction', 'North Korea', 'GPE'], ['North Korea', 'GPE', 'Access', 'Oil', 'Noun'], ['South Korea', 'GPE', 'Investment', 'Winter Games', 'Noun'], ['North Korea', 'GPE', 'Wreck', 'Winter Games', 'Noun'], ['North Korea', 'GPE', 'Leverage', 'Short-Term', 'Noun'], ['Experts', 'Noun', 'Skepticism', 'Offer', 'Noun', 'Kim Jong Un'], ['Timing', 'Noun', 'Reason', 'Skepticism', 'Noun', 'Offer', 'Kim Jong Un']]", 'category': 'closed_qa'}
{'input': '16 Hours Ago | 04:07 .North Korea called itself a nuclear power on Monday, but the question now is whether U.S. President Donald Trump recognizes the rogue regime as one, a strategist told CNBC Tuesday. .Thats an important development to watch as actions taken by Trump against North Korea will likely result in a cold war between the U.S. and China , said David Roche, president and global strategist at Independent Strategy. Such a turn of events between the two major powers would have global implications, he added, pointing to how it would affect worldwide trade and investment. .Outlining the two likely scenarios that could play out, Roche said the U.S. may try to contain North Korea by having rings of missiles throughout the Asia Pacific region pointing at Pyongyang or it could try to remove the hermit nations leader Kim Jong Un through an attack. .Both those scenarios undermine Chinas influence — they would remove a key strategic ally from Beijings foreign policy plan — and would lead to an almost inevitable cold war between China and the U.S., he said. Jonathan Ernst | Reuters President Donald Trump and Chinas President Xi Jinping leave after an opera performance at the Forbidden City in Beijing, China, November 8, 2017. .One of these two outcomes is pretty likely so what comes out of that is all sorts of things: trade complications, cold wars et cetera. And that, I think, would be a major geopolitical forecast I would make for this year, said Roche. .Kim declared North Korea a peace-loving and responsible nuclear power in his annual New Years Day address on Monday, Reuters reported. The leader also said the U.S. should be aware that his countrys nuclear forces are now a reality, not a threat, but claimed that he was open to dialogue with the South. .Pyongyangs testing of its nuclear weapons escalated tensions throughout 2017 and brewed fiery rhetoric between Trump and Kim. But other than some knee-jerk reactions, financial markets mostly shrugged off those developments. .Roche said it is hard to predict how Trump will react to Kims latest declaration, but any actions by the U.S. will hit equities more than other asset classes. .The major casualty out of this would be equities because equities are now based upon such optimism that any really negative impact will affect the most high-flown asset, he said.', 'output': "[['North Korea', 'GPE', 'Call', 'Nuclear Power', 'CONCEPT'], ['U.S. President Donald Trump', 'PERSON', 'Recognize', 'North Korea', 'GPE'], ['David Roche', 'PERSON', 'Say', 'Important Development', 'CONCEPT'], ['U.S.', 'ORG/GOV', 'Likely Result', 'Cold War', 'CONCEPT'], ['China', 'GPE', 'Participates_In', 'Cold War', 'CONCEPT'], ['U.S.', 'ORG/GOV', 'Try', 'Contain', 'VERB', 'North Korea', 'GPE'], ['U.S.', 'ORG/GOV', 'Try', 'Remove', 'VERB', 'Kim Jong Un', 'PERSON'], ['China', 'GPE', 'Lose', 'Influence', 'VERB'], ['U.S.', 'ORG/GOV', 'Impact', 'Worldwide Trade', 'SECTOR'], ['U.S.', 'ORG/GOV', 'Impact', 'Worldwide Investment', 'SECTOR'], ['Kim Jong Un', 'PERSON', 'Declare', 'Peace-Loving Nuclear Power', 'CONCEPT'], ['North Korea', 'GPE', 'Open', 'Dialogue', 'VERB', 'South', 'GPE'], ['North Korea', 'GPE', 'Test', 'Nuclear Weapons', 'CONCEPT'], ['Trump', 'PERSON', 'Knee-Jerk Reactions', 'Financial Markets', 'SECTOR'], ['David Roche', 'PERSON', 'Say', 'Actions U.S.', 'ORG/GOV', 'Hit', 'Equities', 'SECTOR'], ['Equities', 'SECTOR', 'Major Casualty', 'Out', 'VERB', 'This', 'PRON']]", 'category': 'closed_qa'}
{'input': 'NEW YORK Much of the stock market’s recent boom resided in an acronym: FAANG, for Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google, aka Alphabet. As important as they’ve become, investors tired of this trade can look forward in 2018 to a new set of letters to jumble into a more exciting investment thesis. Call it SLAW..Four of the most highly valued private companies - Spotify, Lyft, Airbnb and WeWork – are in various stages of preparing to go public. Although none may ever match the scale of a FAANG or a BAT – as China’s Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent are known – they’re uniquely disruptive enterprises whose success, or failure, may determine the future of cities, mobility, work and fun..The FAANG components altered the internet, retailing, communications and entertainment businesses. It’s hard to imagine the next debutantes blossoming into $900 billion Apples, but they operate in areas offering extraordinary potential to snatch market share from incumbents and stimulate new demand for their products..Take Lyft. Though second in the United States to Uber in ride hailing, an initial public offering would make it the first pure play for public investors on a future where transportation is sold as a service, not as an automobile. That potential has lured investors, including Google and General Motors, into giving it a $10 billion valuation..Similarly, Airbnb has snagged a $31 billion valuation as the leading home-rental app. Founder Brian Chesky says he’s taking a “get rich slow” approach, but will be ready for an IPO in 2018. That would offer a way to bet on the emerging model for the lodging industry..What Chesky is doing to hotels, Adam Neumann is doing to office space with WeWork. While it sounds grand to suggest Neumann’s company is redefining the future of work, it was credible enough for SoftBank to shell out $4.4 billion, valuing WeWork at some $20 billion..Then there’s Spotify, which has upended the music industry with its streaming service. As if that’s not unruly enough, founder Daniel Ek plans to list Spotify’s shares without an IPO, potentially upsetting Wall Street’s lucrative underwriting cartel..These firms could choose to remain in private hands for another few years. But with investors hankering for ways to capitalize on changes to the way we work, play and travel, the ingredients to make a perfect SLAW will come together nicely in 2018..

{'input': 'January 3, 2018 / 2:00 PM / Updated 31 minutes ago Washington sets example at top of sustainable city ladder Carey L. Biron 6 Min Read .WASHINGTON (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - On a work day, the U.S. capital does not appear much more “sustainable” than any other major city. Its streets are packed with cars, lights flicker in offices long after the occupants have gone home, and stark economic divides persist between neighborhoods. .But beneath the surface, something is working in Washington, D.C., experts say. .In August, the city was the first to receive the top “platinum” certification under a global sustainability program called LEED for Cities, which tracks performance on energy use, waste management, water, transport and even quality of life. .Washington was joined by Phoenix in December. .The LEED for Cities framework, which celebrated its first birthday last month, is an expansion of the world’s most widely used rating system for green buildings. .Places earning top marks with LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) could serve as a model for officials around the world seeking to prove to investors and others that their cities are clean, green and offer a high quality of life, experts say. .Last month Arlington County, across the Potomac River from Washington, received the first top certification under another year-old framework, LEED for Communities, which is similar to the cities’ framework but covers different geographical scales. .With more certifications expected in early 2018, organizers say surging interest stems from the Paris Agreement on climate change – shunned by U.S. President Donald Trump – which has paved the way for local governments to step up as leaders in caring for the planet. .More than 100 cities around the world have expressed interest in the program so far. .Roger Platt, senior vice president at the U.S. Green Building Council, a nonprofit that created LEED, said Asian partners, including China and India, advised that its initial focus on buildings was too narrow for the breadth and speed at which cities are transforming. .LEED for Cities tracks changes in how a city is performing across 14 metrics. It uses an online platform allowing cities to analyze and compare their progress, focusing on outcomes rather than pledges. .“We’re at the point now where there’s a tremendous amount of information on strategies to be cleaner,” said Platt. .“What’s missing - and what we think we can do - is a very disciplined and rigorous system for determining whether the use of these strategies is actually creating measurable improvement,” he said. EARLY MOVER .Washington’s top certification under LEED for Cities shows the rapid progress it has made in recent years, Platt noted. .Between 2006 and 2013, it reduced carbon emissions by almost a third, to 11.9 tonnes per capita. Water consumption fell by more than 13 percent in the past five years. And today the city recycles about half of its waste - more than double New York City’s rate. .Washington even does well under the LEED metrics on social equity, which include a city’s affordability and distribution of wealth. .The U.S. capital was an early adopter of strategic plans around sustainability and the data required to measure progress, experts say. .It has focused for years on efficiency in its buildings, as one of the first cities to pass legislation in 2006 requiring use of the LEED for Buildings standard, said Jay Wilson, an analyst with the city’s Urban Sustainability Administration. .It has also regularly raised minimum standards in regulations and enforced rules such as green construction codes. .Wilson said LEED for Cities will now help Washington put all its sustainability data in one place, highlighting potential synergies - for instance, a gauge of miles driven per capita can double as a measure of emissions and walkability. .He also hopes the city can publicize its data in innovative ways, making residents aware of the shift to sustainability and steps households can take to support it. .As more cities go through the certification process, metrics will evolve in line with needs, and new trail-blazers are likely to emerge, organizers say. .“We look to celebrate what has been accomplished by Washington, but it will be a challenge for them to remain in that leadership role,” Platt said. DATA REQUIRED .Surat, India’s eighth-largest city and among its fastest-growing urban areas, is one city looking to learn from Washington. .A few hours north of Mumbai by car, Surat is working towards the LEED for Cities certification. The city’s expansion has made efficiency in service delivery a key concern, an official said. .M. Nagarajan, deputy commissioner of the Surat Municipal Corporation, said achieving the certification would help Surat create a green image, and attract best practices and technologies from developed countries. .But first it needs to iron out a few “hitches”, he said, particularly around data on greenhouse gas emissions, which is outdated, and on equity, which is not methodically researched for Indian cities. .The data element is also critical for Savona in Italy, another city undergoing LEED certification. .Mayor Ilaria Caprioglio said the short-term goal is to gather data providing a detailed overview of Savona’s levels of sustainability, which can then inform future decisions. .Savona, a town of 62,000 in the country’s northwest, is an important port for Mediterranean cruise lines, and it is now in the midst of a multi-year agreement to bolster sustainable development in the cruise industry. .“Our aim is to give the new generations an increasingly green, smart and environmentally friendly city,” Caprioglio said.

{'input': '(Adds analyst quotes, background).SAN FRANCISCO, Jan 3 (Reuters) - Tesla Inc delayed a production target for its new Model 3 sedan for the second time on Wednesday, disappointing investors even as it claimed major progress overcoming manufacturing challenges that have hampered the vehicles rollout..The electric vehicle maker headed by Elon Musk said it would likely build about 2,500 Model 3s per week by the end of the first quarter, half the number it had earlier promised. Instead, Tesla said it now plans to reach its goal of 5,000 vehicles per week by the end of the second quarter..The delay sent shares of the Palo Alto, California-based company down 2 percent in after-market trading..The Model 3 is critical to Teslas long-term success, as it is the most affordable of its cars to date and is the only one capable of transforming the niche automaker to a mass producer amid a sea of rivals entering the nascent electric vehicle market..Building the car efficiently and delivering it without delays to customers is also critical, as the money-losing company faces high cash burn. Delays increase the risk that reservation-holders will cancel orders..The further delay to (production volume) will leave analysts and investors focused on the implications for cash as we head through the first half of the year, Evercore analyst George Galliers told Reuters..The company burned through $1.1 billion in capital expenditures in its third quarter and said in November that fourth-quarter capex would also be about $1.1 billion..RBC Capital Markets analyst Joseph Spak wrote in a note that he did not believe Tesla will be required to do a capital raise..We have them hovering about $1 billion in cash ... They dont have a ton of wiggle room though in our view, Spak said..In delivering 1,550 of its new Model 3 electric vehicles in the fourth quarter, Tesla fell short of Wall Street expectations. Analysts had expected 4,100 Model 3 sedans to be delivered in the fourth quarter, according to financial data and analytics firm FactSet..The estimates for Model 3 deliveries by different brokerages varied widely. While Evercore analysts estimated 5,800 deliveries, Cowen analysts expected just 2,250..Tesla said 860 Model 3 vehicles were in transit to customers at the end of the fourth quarter..The company said it delivered a total of 29,870 vehicles in the fourth quarter, including 15,200 Model S vehicles and 13,120 Model X cars. Analysts had expected total deliveries of about 30,000..PRODUCTION ACCELERATING.Tesla had initially predicted to reach the milestone of 5,000 vehicles per week in December, but in November deferred the target to the end of the first quarter..Tesla said on Wednesday its production rate had increased significantly despite the delays..In the last seven working days of the quarter, we made 793 Model 3s, and in the last few days, we hit a production rate on each of our manufacturing lines that extrapolates to over 1,000 Model 3s per week, the company said in a statement..That pace of production is still below that of many carmakers. A conventional car factory operating at full speed on two shifts can churn out nearly 1,000 vehicles a day..The Model 3 - which starts at $35,000, or about half the price of its flagship Model S - was met with great enthusiasm when its prototype was first unveiled in early 2016. Tesla said in August it had about 500,000 reservations for the car and demand was not a constraint..Production, however, hit snags during a period of manufacturing hell Musk first warned of in July. Among the issues Tesla faced was its battery module assembly line at its Nevada Gigafactory, which required a redesign..In its third quarter, Tesla built just 260 Model 3s..Although bullish investors have generally waved off early Model 3 problems, instead focusing on the future prospects of Tesla, critics warn that Model 3 issues could sour demand for Teslas mass-market vehicle, delay sorely needed revenue and compromise the companys ability to raise cash in the future..Tesla shares, despite paring some gains from a high of $385 in September, still trade at 46 percent above their price a year ago.

Cricket - Australia v England - Ashes test match - WACA Ground, Perth, Australia, December 17, 2017 - Australias Mitchell Starc celebrates after bowling Englands James Vince during the fourth day of the third Ashes cricket test match. REUTERS/David Gray .Left-arm quick Starc, the leading wicket-taker in the series after claiming 19 in the first three tests as Australia wrested back the Ashes, missed the drawn fourth test in Melbourne with a bruised heel but confirmed his fitness in the nets. .“Starcy’s pulled up pretty well this morning and said he’s ready to go,” Smith told reporters at the Sydney Cricket Ground (SCG). .“The break that he’s had from bowling has helped his heel heal, it’s coming on nicely, he’s confident. You’ve got to take the player’s words sometimes, and hopefully he gets through fine ...” .The Australia skipper, who has accumulated a series-leading 604 runs at an average of 151, left no one in any doubt that he would be leading his side out on Thursday despite missing training on Tuesday because of a bad back. .“It’s a little bit stiff but nothing I haven’t dealt with before,” Smith said. Cricket - Ashes test match - Australia v England - MCG, Melbourne, Australia, December 30, 2017. Australias captain Steve Smith reacts after reaching his century during the fifth day of the fourth Ashes cricket test match. REUTERS/David Gray .”I’ll have a good hit and a good catch today and I’ll be fine tomorrow. .“I love batting out here at the SCG, it’s my home ground and I’ve made a few good scores. So hopefully I can continue the run.” .The side was confirmed after Australia’s training session with Starc returning in place of Jackson Bird, who laboured as a stand-in on an Melbourne Cricket Ground pitch rated as “poor” by the governing International Cricket Council. .Left-arm tweaker Ashton Agar was also brought into the squad to offer Australia the option of going with two spinners if it looked like the SCG was going to offer a lot of turn. .Smith, though, said the state of the pitch made it unlikely that one of the quicks would make way for Agar to play alongside off spinner Nathan Lyon as the hosts look to wrap up the series 4-0. .“The wicket’s got a fair bit of grass and looks to be a pretty good wicket,” he added. “I’d say we’d probably opt for just the one spinner.” .Team: Steve Smith (captain), David Warner, Cameron Bancroft, Usman Khawaja, Shaun Marsh, Mitchell Marsh, Tim Paine (wicketkeeper), Mitchell Starc, Pat Cummins, Nathan Lyon, Josh Hazlewood.

{'input': 'Nobel-winning sleep research shows dangers of phone use in bed .Cobb was referring to the very small spiral tube encased within the inner ear, which contains the nerve endings that transmit sound vibrations from the middle ear to the auditory nerve. Its a poorly understood organ in the middle of one of the hardest bones in the body, Cobb said. Noise-induced damage to the nearly 15,000 tiny hair cells and neurons in the cochlea or to the auditory nerve is by far the leading cause of whats known as sensorineural hearing loss . .In order to develop drugs to accurately target either the auditory nerve or hair cells, Decibels researchers delve into the anatomy of the inner ear, down to the cellular level. If you dont do the fundamental work to understand what youre trying to achieve and actually getting the drug in there, its shooting in the dark in terms of doing clinical development, Cobb said. .In late November, Decibel entered into a partnership with Regeneron, a biotech drug developer in Tarrytown, New York. Besides accessing Regeneron s robust research tools, particularly in genetics, Decibel also will benefit from its financial support. Decibel, however, retains worldwide development and commercialization rights to any products discovered in the collaboration and will pay Regeneron tiered royalties based on net sales. Building a solution that uses the bodys organic design .Just north of Boston, in Woburn, Massachusetts, Frequency Therapeutics was founded in 2015 by biomedical engineers Bob Langer of MIT and Jeffrey Karp of Harvard Medical School. Frequencys focus is on developing small molecule drugs that activate dormant progenitor cells, types of stem cells, to repair damaged cochlear hair cells and restore hearing. Its important to do it in an organic way, as the body had originally designed it to be done, said David Lucchino, co-founder, president and CEO of Frequency. .He likens the process to immunotherapy, which activates the bodys immune system, an increasingly successful approach in treating cancer. We are reactivating the bodys system and letting it do the work, Lucchino said. Boston Globe | Getty Images Frequency Therapeutics founders Bob Langer, David Lucchino, and Jeff Karp in Cambridge, Massachusetts, April 10, 2017. The company is developing disease-modifying treatment for hearing loss. .Delivering its drugs to the hard-to-reach hair cells has been a limiting factor. One of Frequencys key breakthroughs was figuring out how to grow cochlear tissue outside the body to do proper drug screening, thereby allowing researchers to identify the small molecules that have this effect. The challenge is to translate that to inside the body and show you can get the biological response in humans, Lucchino said. Thats what were doing in the clinic now. .In December the company announced the successful completion of a Phase 1 human study of FX-322, Frequencys lead progenitor cell activation drug, demonstrating its safety and tolerability. We expect to start a Phase 2 clinical study in the second half of 2018, Lucchino said. The company has previously raised $32 million in Series A funding from CoBro Ventures, Morningside Ventures, Alexandria Real Estate Equities and other investors, and expects to begin a Series B round later this year. A few small publicly traded firms also pursuing breakthroughs .Two publicly traded companies are making noise in this space. Auris Medical , a Swiss biopharmaceutical firm, is in advanced clinical development of drugs to treat inner-ear hearing loss and tinnitus, the condition of ringing or buzzing in the ears. .San Diego-based Otonomy , founded in 2008, has taken a three-pronged approach in its drug R&D. The first targets chemotherapy-induced hearing loss, a side effect of some cancer-fighting medicines, in particular platinum-based agents. Weve conducted preliminary clinical research in that area and are working to develop a product, said CEO and president David Weber. .Otonomy also concentrates on treating sensorineural destruction of the ribbon synapse connections that connect hair cells to the auditory nerve bundle, which results in earlier-stage hearing loss. That condition might not be profound enough to be detected in a hearing test, Weber said, but is contributing to what Ill call cocktail noise hearing loss: You cant distinguish sounds at a cocktail party where theres a lot of background sound. .Otonomy has developed a drug therapy, which has shown proof of concept in an animal model, to restore synapse connections and functional hearing. Otonomy also is developing medicines to restore the loss of hair cells. All three programs are in the preclinical stages, Weber said, and he declined to predict how soon any would move to the human clinical trial stage. .Although one or more drugs that might temporarily or permanently repair inner-ear damage and restore hearing loss is still several years away from commercial availability, Decibels Cobb offered some sound advice on how to prevent hearing problems. The best way to handle noise damage, she said, is to wear earplugs. .— Bob Woods, special to CNBC.com Bob Woods Special to CNBC.com Related Securities', 'output': "[['Nobel-winning sleep research', 'CONCEPT', 'Show', 'Dangers', 'CONCEPT'], ['Decibel', 'COMP', 'Participates_In', 'Drug Development', 'CONCEPT'], ['Decibel', 'COMP', 'Enter_Into', 'Partnership', 'CONCEPT', 'With', 'Regeneron', 'ORG/REG'], ['Decibel', 'COMP', 'Retains', 'Rights', 'CONCEPT'], ['Decibel', 'COMP', 'Pay', 'Tiered Royalties', 'CONCEPT', 'Based', 'Net Sales', 'CONCEPT'], ['Frequency Therapeutics', 'COMP', 'Founded', 'Biomedical Engineers', 'PERSON', 'In', 'Woburn', 'GPE'], ['Frequency Therapeutics', 'COMP', 'Focus', 'Activating', 'CONCEPT', 'Dormant Progenitor Cells', 'CONCEPT'], ['Frequency Therapeutics', 'COMP', 'Deliver', 'Drugs', 'CONCEPT', 'To', 'Cochlear Hair Cells', 'CONCEPT'], ['Frequency Therapeutics', 'COMP', 'Complete', 'Phase 1 Human Study', 'EVENT', 'Of', 'FX-322', 'PRODUCT'], ['Frequency Therapeutics', 'COMP', 'Expect', 'Start', 'Phase 2 Clinical Study', 'EVENT', 'In', 'Second Half', 'TIME', 'Of', '2018', 'TIME'], ['Frequency Therapeutics', 'COMP', 'Raise', '$32 Million', 'CONCEPT', 'In', 'Series A Funding', 'CONCEPT'], ['Auris Medical', 'COMP', 'In', 'Advanced Clinical Development', 'CONCEPT', 'Of', 'Drugs', 'CONCEPT', 'To', 'Treat', 'Inner-Ear Hearing Loss', 'CONCEPT', 'And', 'Tinnitus', 'CONCEPT'], ['Otonomy', 'COMP', 'Conduct', 'Preliminary Clinical Research', 'EVENT', 'In', 'Chemotherapy-Induced Hearing Loss', 'CONCEPT'], ['Otonomy', 'COMP', 'Develop', 'Drug Therapy', 'CONCEPT', 'To', 'Restore Synapse Connections', 'CONCEPT', 'And', 'Functional Hearing', 'CONCEPT'], ['Otonomy', 'COMP', 'Decline', 'Predict', 'CONCEPT', 'How', 'Soon', 'CONCEPT', 'Any', 'CONCEPT', 'Move', 'CONCEPT', 'To', 'Human Clinical Trial Stage', 'CONCEPT'], ['Cobb', 'PERSON', 'Offer', 'Advice', 'CONCEPT', 'On', 'Preventing', 'CONCEPT', 'Hearing Problems', 'CONCEPT']]", 'category': 'closed_qa'}

Wednesday gain brought it back to November levels before a third-quarter sales miss. .“The Next share price rollercoaster continues,” said Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets. .“Management’s update-by-update tinkering of guidance and sharp share price reactions only goes to reinforce how shareholders remain at the mercy of the UK consumer from one season to the next and exposed to short-termism.” .The main non-food retailers drove the market, with Marks & Spencer up 2 percent while Primark owner ABF gained 2.6 percent. .Mid and small-caps also jumped on the retail rally and the more domestically-focused indexes rose 0.2 percent each. .Fashion retailer N Brown rose 7 percent to the top of the FTSE 250, and shares in small-cap department store Debenhams rose 3.8 percent. .Oil majors Royal Dutch Shell and BP, still feeling the glow from a remarkably strong start to the year for crude prices, also delivered a boost. .But the FTSE 100 stayed negative as the weightier financials and consumer staples sectors wilted. .Heavyweights Diageo, Imperial Brands and British American Tobacco fell 0.5 to 1 percent. The highly U.S.-exposed firms were dented by the decline in the dollar which sank to a near four-month low. .Financials were led lower by HSBC and Standard Chartered, the most internationally-exposed of the UK-listed banks which also suffer from a weaker dollar. .EU regulatory reforms under the MiFID II market directive that came into force on Wednesday had little early impact on the market, traders said. .Some suggested the wide-ranging new rules could distract investors from their trading desks as they adjusted to the change.

Anger soon turned to Iran’s clerical establishment in power since the 1979 revolution. .Some called on Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei to step down and chanted against a government they described as thieves.

A man watches as smoke rises from Harasta area, as seen from Douma, in the eastern Damascus suburb of Ghouta, Syria November 14, 2017. REUTERS/Bassam Khabieh .They said the army was amassing elite forces to prepare for a major assault on the Military Vehicles Administration, which is besieged by rebels. At least 200 troops were believed to be trapped within its sprawling, heavily defended grounds. .Since Sunday, rebels mainly belonging to the Islamist Ahrar al Sham faction widened their control of parts of the army base in Harasta that penetrates the Eastern Ghouta, the last rebel bastion around the capital. .They stormed the base last November in a drive to relieve pressure on Eastern Ghouta’s towns and villages, which have seen escalating aerial attacks in the last week. .State media did not report the assault but said “terrorists” had fired mortars on residential areas in Harasta and the army responded by strikes in Eastern Ghouta that led to losses in the ranks of the insurgents. No further details were given. .Civil defence sources said that in four days of heavy aerial strikes since Friday 38 civilians have been killed and at least 147 people have been injured. Five civilians were killed on Tuesday. .The base has long been used to strike at the densely populated Eastern Ghouta in an attempt to force the rebel enclave to submission. More than 300,000 people there have lived under siege by army troops since 2013. .The advances bring rebels closer to the heart of the capital once again, after they were pushed out of their remaining pockets last year by months of siege and bombardment. .The army setback comes against a backdrop of successive battlefield victories that allowed the Syrian army with heavy reliance on Russia and Iran to regain in the last year large tracts of territory from insurgents. .Residents said at least 30 aerial strikes hit residential areas of Eastern Ghouta on Tuesday. Shelling of a market in the city of Douma, the main urban centre in the Ghouta, left one dead and scores injured. .“The frontlines of Ghouta are witnessing battles and clashes and big losses inflicted on (Syrian President) Assad’s forces and his militias,” said Hamza Biriqdar, the spokesman for Jaish al Islam, a main rebel faction. .Further northwest, rebels ranging from jihadists to mainstream Free Syrian Army (FSA) were retreating from more villages seized by the army in southern Idlib province and the adjoining eastern Hama countryside. .The strikes have escalated in the last week on this major front with at least 50 villages retaken by the Syrian army and its allies in their push into the last major province in rebel hands that borders Turkey. .The intensity of strikes by Russia and the Syrian Air Force has driven tens of thousands of villagers in these areas to flee to the relative safety of the northern part of Idlib province near of the Turkish border, where many families have spread makeshift tents on main roads and agricultural land.

African migrants protest outside Israels Supreme Court in Jerusalem January 26, 2017. REUTERS/Ronen Zvulun - RC1376166BF0 .Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, in public remarks at a cabinet meeting on the payment programme, said a barrier Israel completed in 2013 along its border with Egypt had effectively cut off a stream of “illegal infiltrators” from Africa after some 60,000 crossed the desert frontier. .The vast majority came from Eritrea and Sudan and many said they fled war and persecution as well as economic hardship, but Israel treats them as economic migrants. .The plan launched this week offers African migrants a $3,500 (2,581 pounds) payment from the Israeli government and a free air ticket to return home or go to “third countries”, which rights groups identified as Rwanda and Uganda. .“We have expelled about 20,000 and now the mission is to get the rest out,” Netanyahu said. .An immigration official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said there are some 38,000 migrants living illegally in Israel, and some 1,420 are being held in two detention centres. .“Beyond the end of March, those who leave voluntarily will receive a significantly smaller payment that will shrink even more with time, and enforcement measures will begin,” the official said, referring to incarceration. FILE PHOTO - Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu speaks during a dedication ceremony of the Assuta hospital in Ashdod, Israel December 21, 2017. REUTERS/Amir Cohen .Some have lived for years in Israel and work in low-paying jobs that many Israelis shun. Israel has granted asylum to fewer than one percent of those who have applied and has a years-long backlog of applicants. .Rights groups have accused Israel of being slow to process African migrants’ asylum requests as a matter of policy and denying legitimate claims to the status. .Netanyahu has called the migrants’ presence a threat to Israel’s social fabric and Jewish character, and one government minister has referred to them as “a cancer”. .Teklit Michael, a 29-asylum seeker from Eritrea living in Tel Aviv, said in response to the Israeli plan that paying money to other governments to take in Africans was akin to “human trafficking and smuggling”. .“We don’t know what is waiting for us (in Rwanda and Uganda),” he told Reuters by telephone. “They prefer now to stay in prison (in Israel) instead.” .In his remarks, Netanyahu cited the large presence of African migrants in Tel Aviv’s poorer neighbourhoods, where he said “veteran residents” - a reference to Israelis - no longer feel safe. .“So today, we are keeping our promise to restore calm, a sense of personal security and law and order to the residents of south Tel Aviv and those in many other neighbourhoods,” he said.

{'input': 'DALLAS--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Navigator Energy Services (Navigator), a full-service midstream solutions provider based in Dallas, today provided a company update including additional information surrounding its purchase of Glass Mountain Pipeline, LLC (GMP), changes to the leadership team, and its renewed partnership with a fund managed by BlackRock Real Assets..Glass Mountain Pipeline, LLC.As previously announced by SemGroup Corporation and NGL Energy Partners LP , Navigator, in partnership with BlackRock Real Assets, closed on its purchase of 100% of GMP for a total consideration of $600 million. GMP is an approximately 215-mile, multi-play crude oil transportation system located in the STACK/Merge, Granite Wash and Mississippi Lime plays, delivering crude oil to a one million-barrel GMP-owned storage facility at Cushing, Oklahoma..Navigator is currently expanding the GMP system, constructing approximately 44 miles of additional pipeline further into the STACK play, and an additional 250,000 barrels of storage capacity. The expansion is expected to be operational in February 2018. Once complete, the GMP system will include pipeline capacity of approximately 210,000 barrels of oil per day, and approximately 1.8 million barrels of storage..In support of the significant volume growth within the STACK/Merge and Woodford resources plays, Navigator plans to further expand the footprint and overall capacity of the GMP system. Working with producer partners, substantial new gathering infrastructure is also anticipated. The considerable scale of the existing GMP system and its ability to segregate multiple grades of crude allows Navigator to offer customers a fulsome, differentiated suite of services to transport and store crude oil..Navigator Leadership.Navigator is led by a majority of the same leadership team that successfully guided the company to a full asset sale to NuStar Energy L.P. (NuStar) in 2017. The seasoned management team is led by Matt Vining as chief executive officer, and includes two additions: Nick Kubala as vice president of engineering, and Vidal Rosa as vice president of operations..Kubala brings 10 years of engineering experience in a variety of different roles to the Navigator team.

He was formerly the director of operations for Centurion Pipeline LP, where he was responsible for the management of the entire Centurion pipeline system and terminals..BlackRock Real Assets Commitment and Background.A fund managed by BlackRock Real Assets has provided an equity commitment to Navigator that will support the acquisition of GMP, as well as future expansions and growth opportunities. This is the fund’s second partnership with the Navigator management team. The two organizations previously partnered on the construction of Navigator’s Big Spring Gateway project (BSG) which was sold to NuStar for $1.5 billion in May 2017..The BSG system consisted of more than 500 miles of crude oil gathering and transportation pipelines with deliverability of approximately 550,000 barrels per day; a pipeline gathering system with more than 200 connected producer tank batteries capable of more than 400,000 barrels per day of pumping capacity; and approximately 1 million barrels of crude oil storage capacity..Navigator and BlackRock Real Assets Perspectives.“Navigator is proud to partner with BlackRock Real Assets, a global leader in energy investments,” said Matt Vining, Navigator chief executive officer. “As evidenced by the recent Glass Mountain deal, we are confident that BlackRock’s financial strength paired with our execution capacity and customer-focused approach to crude oil midstream services, will expand our existing competitive advantage in the marketplace and position us to source good investment opportunities across all points in the commodity cycle..“From an operations perspective, we are excited about the Glass Mountain asset and look forward to aggressively building out its footprint under the same customer-focused foundation on which we have built Navigator’s reputation,” continued Vining..“This is our second partnership with the Navigator management team,” said Mark Saxe, managing director in BlackRock’s Global Energy & Power Infrastructure group with BlackRock Real Assets. “They have an outstanding reputation in the producer community as being a responsive, dynamic and creative group that works tirelessly to provide reliable and flexible midstream solutions.

{'input': 'Tesla Model 3 challenges and cash burn worries may overshadow delivery numbers Cowen analyst Jeffrey Osborne slashed his estimate for Model 3 production by 75 percent. Teslas likely healthy delivery numbers for its older models could be pushed aside over concerns about Model 3 production and the money the company continues to burn through, Osborne said. SHARES Mark Ralston | AFP | Getty Images Exterior of the new Tesla Model 3, at the 2017 LA Auto Show in Los Angeles, California on November 29, 2017. .Teslas Model 3 production challenges and continued cash burn will likely steal attention from solid deliveries of Teslas other models, says one analyst. .Tesla early this week could announce deliveries of 2,250 Model 3 sedans, Cowen analyst Jeffrey Osborne estimates in a note Tuesday. That would be 75 percent less than Osborne had previously forecast, and well below the 4,000 to 5,000 consensus estimate held by Wall Street that Osborne cited. .The disappointing pace of the Model 3 production ramp up is likely to distract investors from healthy combined delivery numbers on the Model S and X, Osborne said. He estimates 25,250 Model S and X cars were delivered. .Whats more, Tesla was originally forecasting it would be producing 5,000 Model 3 sedans each week by the end of the fourth quarter. It later pushed that goal back and said it would achieve that pace by the end of the first quarter. .Tesla shares shot sky-high in 2017, rising about 50 percent in part on the enthusiasm over the Model 3. On Tuesday, shares were up about 2.5 percent, trading just under $320. Nevertheless, Osborne has an underperform rating on the stock and a $170 price target as competitive threats loom on the horizon and Tesla continues to burn cash. .Osborne said he thinks Tesla burned through $1.2 billion in cash in the fourth quarter, and that the company will yet again need to raise capital in either the first or early second quarter. .The narrative around high volume manufacturing of the Model 3 and hitting the 25 percent gross margin target will need to be amplified by management in order for investors to digest such a capital raise in our view, he said. We also hope for more transparency on what Elon Musks overall vision will truly cost as we believe investors are overlooking many aspects of his total vision and [are] myopically focused on the upcoming quarter or two. .In particular, Tesla may have to spend further at its current factories and make production investments for the Tesla Semi, Roadster, and the Model Y, and a plant in China. This could all add $15 billion to $20 billion in capital expenditures from 2018-2020, he said.', 'output': "[['Tesla', 'PERSON', 'Produce', 'Model 3', 'PRODUCT'], ['Cowen', 'ORG', 'Raise', 'Estimate', 'PRODUCT'], ['Tesla', 'PERSON', 'Operate_In', 'Automotive Industry', 'SECTOR'], ['Cowen', 'ORG', 'Impact_On', 'Tesla', 'PERSON'], ['Tesla', 'PERSON', 'Decrease', 'Production Estimate', 'PRODUCT'], ['Wall Street', 'ORG', 'Control', 'Consensus Estimate', 'PRODUCT'], ['Tesla', 'PERSON', 'Produce', 'Model S', 'PRODUCT'], ['Tesla', 'PERSON', 'Produce', 'Model X', 'PRODUCT'], ['Tesla', 'PERSON', 'Negative_Impact_On', 'Investor Attention', 'CONCEPT'], ['Tesla', 'PERSON', 'Estimate', 'Delivery Numbers', 'PRODUCT'], ['Tesla', 'PERSON', 'Forecast', 'Production Numbers', 'PRODUCT'], ['Tesla', 'PERSON', 'Push_Back', 'Production Goal', 'CONCEPT'], ['Tesla', 'PERSON', 'Operate_In', 'Stock Market', 'SECTOR'], ['Tesla', 'PERSON', 'Has', 'Underperform Rating', 'CONCEPT'], ['Tesla', 'PERSON', 'Has', 'Price Target', 'CONCEPT'], ['Tesla', 'PERSON', 'Invests_In', 'Competitive Threats', 'CONCEPT'], ['Tesla', 'PERSON', 'Burn', 'Cash', 'FIN_INSTRUMENT'], ['Tesla', 'PERSON', 'Raise', 'Capital', 'FIN_INSTRUMENT'], ['Tesla', 'PERSON', 'Amplify', 'Narrative', 'CONCEPT'], ['Tesla', 'PERSON', 'Invest', 'Factories', 'COMP'], ['Tesla', 'PERSON', 'Invest', 'Production', 'CONCEPT'], ['Tesla', 'PERSON', 'Relate_To', 'Tesla Semi', 'PRODUCT'], ['Tesla', 'PERSON', 'Relate_To', 'Roadster', 'PRODUCT'], ['Tesla', 'PERSON', 'Relate_To', 'Model Y', 'PRODUCT'], ['Tesla', 'PERSON', 'Relate_To', 'China Plant', 'COMP'], ['Tesla', 'PERSON', 'Impact_On', 'Capital Expenditures', 'FIN_INSTRUMENT'], ['Investor', 'PERSON', 'Focus_On', 'Quarterly Results', 'CONCEPT']]", 'category': 'closed_qa'}

But if it does, we must bring even tougher measures to bear against the North Korean regime,” Haley said..South Korea on Tuesday offered talks with North Korea next week, amid a tense standoff over Pyongyang’s nuclear and missile programmes, after North Korean leader Kim Jong Un said in a New Year’s Day speech that he was “open to dialogue” with Seoul..Kim also said he was open to the possibility of North Korean athletes taking part in Winter Olympics South Korea hosts next month..At the same time, he stressed that his country would push ahead with “mass producing” nuclear warheads in defiance of U.N. sanctions and that he had a nuclear button on his desk capable of launching missiles at the United States..U.S. President Donald Trump responded to Kim in a Twitter post on Tuesday: “Will someone from his depleted and food starved regime please inform him that I too have a Nuclear Button, but it is a much bigger & more powerful one than his, and my Button works!”.Haley said the United States would not take talks seriously if they did not take steps toward banning North Korea’s nuclear weapons..“North Korea can talk to anyone they want, but the U.S. is not going to recognise it or acknowledge it until they agree to ban the nuclear weapons that they have,” she said..Haley gave no details of the missile test preparations..Another U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said there were indications that could point toward a potential missile launch “sooner rather than later,” but cautioned that such signs had been seen in the past and no test had resulted..‘DRIVE A WEDGE’.A combination photo shows a Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) handout of Kim Jong Un released on May 10, 2016, and Donald Trump posing for a photo in New York City, U.S., May 17, 2016. REUTERS/KCNA handout via Reuters/Files U.S. State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said North Korea might be “trying to drive a wedge of some sort” between the United States and South Korea and added that while it was up to Seoul to decide who it talked to: “We are very skeptical of Kim Jong Un’s sincerity in sitting down and having talks.”.Trump, who has led a global drive to pressure North Korea through sanctions to give up development of nuclear-tipped missiles capable of hitting the United States, earlier held back judgment on Pyongyang’s offer to talk, saying on Twitter:.”Rocket man now wants to talk to South Korea for first time. “Perhaps that is good news, perhaps not - we will see!”.Trump has frequently derided Kim as “rocket man.” The U.S. president said sanctions and other pressures were starting to have a big impact on North Korea..Slideshow (3 Images) Kim and Trump have exchanged fiery barbs in the last year and the U.S. president has warned that the United States would have no choice but to “totally destroy” North Korea if forced to defend itself or its allies..North Korea regularly threatens to destroy the United States, South Korea and Japan and tested its most powerful intercontinental ballistic missile in November, which it said was capable of delivering a warhead anywhere in the United States..South Korea’s Unification Minister Cho Myong-gyon said the offer for high-level talks next Tuesday had been discussed with the United States. Nauert said she was not aware if the matter had been discussed in advance of the South Korean response..Cho suggested the talks be held at the border village of Panmunjom and said they should be focused on North Korea’s participation at the Olympics, but other issues would likely arise, including the denuclearisation of North Korea..“I repeat: The government is open to talking with North Korea, regardless of time, location and form,” Cho said..Should the talks be held, it would be the first such dialogue since a vice-ministerial meeting in December 2015..South Korean President Moon Jae-in welcomed Kim’s New Year address and asked his government to move as quickly as possible to bring North Korea to the Olympics, but he stressed that an improvement in inter-Korean relations “cannot go separately with resolving North Korea’s nuclear programme”..China, which has persistently urged a return to talks to ease tensions, said recent positive comments from North and South Korea were a good thing..“China welcomes and supports North Korea and South Korea taking earnest efforts to treat this as an opportunity to improve mutual relations, promote the alleviation of the situation on the Korean peninsula and realize denuclearisation on the peninsula,” Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said..Reporting by Christine Kim, Jane Chung and Hyonhee Shin in Seoul, Michael Martina in Beijing, Doina Chiacu, David Brunnstrom, David Alexander and Arshad Mohammed in Washington, and Rodrigo Campos at the United Nations; Editing by Andrew Hay, Alistair Bell and Lisa Shumaker.

This will never go away,” Russi told Reuters. “I will always be nervous because somewhere I am always also a little bit afraid, because I know too good that bad things can happen every moment, every time, every day.”.The run-up to these Olympics has highlighted that danger, with the deaths of Frenchman David Poisson and German teenager Max Burkhart in the space of just several weeks in November and December..While Russi sees the timing as a tragic coincidence, the risk inherent in the sport is a constant..As he talks about the job of designing courses, it’s clear he sees one of his most vital roles as building in a safety margin for the athletes at the same time as guaranteeing a thrilling spectacle..“I think in a good downhill I need at least three good jumps. I have to count that the jumps are probably 50 meters long, so I have to be careful that the landing zone is probably 70, 80 meters,” he said..“If I calculate that with the speed, and the edge and the steepness the racers will jump 50 meters, I have to give them an additional space of 10 to 20 meters for safely landing in case somebody misses the jump completely - then instead of jumping 45 meters he will fly for 70, and I have to make sure that if he makes this mistake he’s not landing on the flat.”.STARTING FROM ZERO The complexity of the course designer’s task varies hugely from one Olympics to the next, depending on whether there is existing ski infrastructure on the mountain..The Jeongseon site in South Korea is one of several where Russi has started from zero - when he first went there in 2001, there was “nothing at all. There was a forest road until maybe half-way up and from there nothing, not even a cat walk.”.It was after the Koreans were finally awarded the Games in 2011, at their third attempt, that the Swiss set to work. Since then, he estimates he has visited about 30 times..FILE PHOTO: A general view from the spectator seating area of the finish area of the Alpine Skiing events of the Sochi 2014 Winter Olympic Games in Rosa Khutor, February 3, 2014. REUTERS/Mike Segar/File photo The first step is to study the maps, assessing the contours and judging the steepness of the various possible descents. The second is to get his hiking boots on..“I always say I walk the mountain in order to be able to listen to what the mountain is telling me... Especially in this case, I felt that here is a mountain which has a lot of changing terrains.”.Through his exploration, Russi gets to know the steep and flatter portions, discover the edges and ridges..“After I know that, I try to build up the story of the mountain. Is it a wild one, or is it a more technical one, or is it more speed or is it more air?”.Sometimes he needs to modify the terrain, for example by filling in a hole or moving some earth to create an adequate landing zone..FILE PHOTO: Bernhard Russi of Switzerland, Olympic Downhill gold medalist of the 1972 Winter Olympic Games of Sapporo and designer of all Olympic Downhill courses since 1988 in Calgary, looks up at his new course in Rosa Khutor near Sochi before the first practice run for the mens Alpine Skiing World Cup Downhill race February 8, 2012. REUTERS/Wolfgang Rattay/File Photo But generally he aims to touch the mountain as little as possible. He’s proud that for these Olympics, in the interest of sustainability, agreement was reached to build a single downhill course for men and women - something that hasn’t been done before, but will be repeated when China hosts the Games in 2022..EXTRA DIFFICULTY After years of work, the time comes to test the course with the world’s best skiers. Norway’s Kjetil Jansrud won a men’s World Cup downhill here in 2016, and Italy’s Sofia Goggia pipped American Lindsey Vonn in a women’s race last March - victories that should boost their confidence heading into the Games..But the course will include some new tweaks for the Olympics..“It has been tested very well but after the test there are always some small changes in course-setting and I think we can add a little bit of difficulty towards the Olympics - so I would say that the course will be more difficult than in 2016,” said Russi..“It’s going to be a very challenging downhill, a very difficult downhill, a very attractive downhill.”.If he’s done his job well, he will have set the stage next month - as he has so many times before - for what many see as the purest, most thrilling form of winter sports competition..“You have the top of the mountain, you have the bottom of the mountain, and in between - that’s the challenge,” he said..“The downhill is the mountain and the man.”.Reporting by Mark Trevelyan; editing by Sudipto Ganguly.

{'input': 'By Robert Hackett January 2, 2018 .A Google Chrome extension with more than 100,000 users has been quietly hijacking people’s computers to mine cryptocurrency. .Complaints first surfaced in early December that “ Archive Poster ,” a browser extension designed to help Tumblr users perform various tasks, had been contaminated with a program that mines the cryptocurrency Monero on unsuspecting users’ PCs. The software, which did not ask for people’s permission to operate, slowed down computers as it diverted computing power to mining, which involves solving math puzzles for cryptocurrency rewards. .The incident is the latest in a string of so-called cryptojacking attacks , in which hackers have hijacked PCs through compromised web servers and apps in order to mine cryptocurrency for themselves. Last year, the websites of Showtime, Politifact, and Pirate Bay at one time all unknowingly ran crypto mining software. .Essence Labs, the developer of Archive Poster, acknowledged the problem in a statement on Friday, as PCMag first reported . (The company did not immediately reply to Fortune’s request for comment.) .“An old team member who was responsible for updating the extension had his Google account compromised,” the company told PCMag reporter Michael Kan in an email, which he excerpted on Twitter . “Somehow the extension was hijacked to another Google account.” .The crypto-mining software that sneaked into Archive Poster was Coinhive , a tool that markets itself as a new, non-ad-based way to make money from websites. .The tainted version of the Archive Poster extension has since been removed from the Google Chrome web store. Essence Labs is now pointing people to a supposedly safer version of the extension, which can be downloaded here . .Google did not immediately reply to Fortune’s request for comment about the incident. Lets notify @Google about the #cryptojacking malware found in Chrome extension Archive Poster .Are you one of the 105,062 users? pic.twitter.com/quhHxZFgyf .— Bad Packets Report (@bad_packets) December 29, 2017 .Troy Mursch, a security researcher who has been at the forefront of investigating the recent rash of cryptojacking incidents and who goes by the online alias “ Bad Packets Report ,” indicated to Fortune that he was disappointed by Google’s response to the burgeoning threat. .“I don’t think Google is treating cryptojacking as a serious security issue,” Mursch said in a direct message on Twitter. “They have not come up with a plan of action to prevent it from happening in Chrome.” .Get Data Sheet , Fortune’s technology newsletter. .Cryptojacking has been gaining in popularity alongside a resurgence of interest in cryptocurrencies . Monero, a privacy-oriented coin that has found favor with the criminal underground, is a popular choice for these campaigns due to its unique mining operation, which is optimized for PCs rather than the specialized equipment required by Bitcoin miners. .If your browser is running Archive Poster, you can remove the extension by clicking the menu icon in the top right corner of your browser window (the button looks like a gray traffic light), selecting “More tools,” and “Extensions.” From there, you can manage extension permissions, enabling, disabling, or deleting them as you see fit.

{'input': 'NEW YORK (Reuters) - Petroleo Brasileiro SA ( PETR4.SA ), Brazil’s state-controlled oil company, said on Wednesday it has agreed to pay $2.95 billion to settle a U.S. class action brought by investors who claim they lost money as a result of a corruption scandal..Petrobras, as the company is known, denied any wrongdoing under the deal, which is one of the largest securities class action settlements in the United States. U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff in Manhattan must approve the accord..The settlement was smaller than what many analysts anticipated and was seen as a net positive for the scandal-plagued company. Preferred shares ticked up 0.3 percent to 16.60 reais by midday, roughly in line with the countrys Bovespa .BVSP equities index. U.S.-traded shares ( PBR.N ) were unchanged at $10.70..Analysts at Brazilian bank BTG Pactual said the market had expected a settlement of $5 billion to $10 billion. Moody’s said in a note that if approved the fine “would remove the uncertainty related to the amount to be paid to plaintiffs.”.The plaintiffs were upbeat, too..“Simply put, this litigation and its ultimate resolution has yielded an excellent result for the class,” said Jeremy Lieberman, an attorney for the investors. He called the deal “historic” and said it was the largest ever involving a foreign securities issuer..Investors had sued Petrobras after prosecutors in Brazil accused executives of accepting more than $2 billion in bribes over a decade, mainly from construction and engineering companies..Petrobras claimed it was itself a victim and denied wrongdoing in a securities filing on Wednesday.

Neither could be reached for comment..The largest securities fraud settlements in U.S. history include $7.2 billion stemming from the collapse of Enron, $6.2 billion over an accounting scandal at WorldCom and $3.2 billion over an accounting scandal at Tyco International, according to Stanford Law School’s Securities Class Action Clearinghouse..Reporting by Brendan Pierson in New York; Additional reporting by Gram Slattery and Flavia Bohone in Sao Paulo; Editing by Jason Neely, Susan Fenton and Jeffrey Benkoe.

The country is the worlds biggest oil producer and one of the key backers, together with the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), in cutting supplies..As part of the supply cut deal, Russia pledged to reduce its output by 300,000 bpd from the 30-year monthly high of 11.247 million bpd hit in October 2016, which it achieved by the second quarter of 2017, according to Russian energy ministry data..For the whole of 2017, however, Russian output rose to an average of 10.98 million bpd, compared with 10.96 million bpd in 2016 and 10.72 million bpd in 2015..Even though they have reduced that astronomical number (from Oct. 2016), they are still producing more (in 2017 than in 2016), said Matt Stanley, a fuel broker at Freight Investor Services (FIS) in Dubai..Saxo Banks Hansen said he also had some concerns about the Chinese economy in 2018 that ultimately could lead to lower than expected demand growth..As a result, he said his bank saw lower crude prices by the end of the year, with Brent at $60 per barrel and WTI at $57..(Reporting by Henning Gloystein; Editing by Richard Pullin and Christian Schmollinger)', 'output': "[['Crude oil prices', 'ECON_INDICATOR', 'Not_Far_Off', 'Mid-2015 Highs', 'CONCEPT'], ['U.S.', 'GPE', 'Expected_To', 'See', 'Its', 'output', 'Pass', '10 mln bpd', 'ECON_INDICATOR'], ['Russia', 'GPE', 'Despite', 'Pledge_To_Cut', 'Russian', 'Daily', 'Output', 'In_2017', 'Rose_VS', '2016'], ['Oil_Prices', 'ECON_INDICATOR', 'Dipped', 'Away_From', 'Mid-2015_Highs', 'Reached_Previous_Session'], ['U.S._West_Texas_Intermediate_WTI_Crude_Futures', 'FIN_INSTRUMENT', 'At', '$60.34', 'A_Barrel'], ['Previous_Day', 'CONCEPT', 'Price', '$60.74', 'Reached_On_Previous_Day', 'Most_Since', 'June_2015'], ['Brent_Crude_Futures', 'FIN_INSTRUMENT', 'At', '$66.49', 'A_Barrel'], ['Tuesday', 'CONCEPT', 'High', '$67.29', 'Most_Since', 'May_2015'], ['Traders', 'PERSON', 'Said', 'Markets', 'Had_Recently_Overshot', 'As', 'U.S._Production', 'Is_Set_To_Rise_Further'], ['U.S._Production', 'ECON_INDICATOR', 'Risen', 'By', 'Almost_16_Percent', 'Since_The_Middle_Of_2016'], ['U.S._Production', 'ECON_INDICATOR', 'Hit', '9.75_Million_Bpd', 'At_The_End_Of_Last_Year'], ['Russian_Output', 'ECON_INDICATOR', 'Rose', 'To_An_Average', 'Of_10.98_Million_Bpd', 'For_The_Whole_Of_2017'], ['Russian_Output', 'ECON_INDICATOR', 'Rose_VS', '2016', 'Production'], ['Russian_Output', 'ECON_INDICATOR', 'Rose_VS', '2015', 'Production'], ['Russian_Energy_Ministry_Data', 'ORG', 'According_To', 'Russian_Energy_Ministry_Data'], ['Russia', 'GPE', 'Achieved', 'Reduction', 'By_The_Second_Quarter_Of_2017'], ['Russia', 'GPE', 'Pledged', 'Reduce', 'Its_Output', 'By_300_000_Bpd'], ['OPEC', 'ORG', 'Led_Efforts', 'Tighten', 'The_Market'], ['U.S._Production', 'ECON_INDICATOR', 'Set_To_Rise_Further'], ['Saxo_Bank', 'ORG', 'Warned', 'Multiple_But_Temporary_Supply_Disruptions'], ['North_Sea_Forties', 'CONCEPT', 'And', 'Libyan_Pipeline_Outages', 'And', 'Protests_Across_Iran'], ['Saxo_Bank', 'ORG', 'Said', 'Potential_For_Price_Upturn_In_Early_2018'], ['Saxo_Bank', 'ORG', 'Said', 'Potential_For_Price_Downturn_In_Early_2018'], ['U.S._Production', 'ECON_INDICATOR', 'Reached', '10_Million_Barrel_Per_Day_Target'], ['Henning_Gloystein', 'PERSON', 'Reporting'], ['Richard_Pullin', 'PERSON', 'Editing'], ['Christian_Schmollinger', 'PERSON', 'Editing']]", 'category': 'closed_qa'}

{'input': 'ENGLEWOOD, Colo.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Liberty Interactive LLC (Liberty), a subsidiary of Liberty Interactive Corporation (Nasdaq: QVCA, QVCB, LVNTA, LVNTB), announced the payment today of a quarterly interest payment to the holders, as of December 15, 2017, of its 0.75% Senior Exchangeable Debentures due 2043 (the Debentures). The amount of the quarterly interest payment is $1.875 per $1,000 original principal amount of Debentures. As of December 30, 2017, 1,116 Debentures remained outstanding in the aggregate adjusted principal amount of $422,542, after giving effect to today’s quarterly interest payment..Under the Indenture for the Debentures, the original principal amount of the Debentures is reduced in an amount equal to each extraordinary distribution that is made to holders of the Debentures. Thereafter, the adjusted principal amount is further reduced on each successive quarterly interest payment date to the extent necessary to cause the quarterly interest payment to represent the payment of an annualized yield of 0.75% of the adjusted principal amount. This latter adjustment, to the extent it is made by reason of a particular extraordinary distribution that results in a reduction to the principal amount of the Debentures, takes effect on the second succeeding interest payment date after the payment of that extraordinary distribution..To date, Liberty has made one extraordinary distribution to holders of the Debentures. On June 16, 2016, Liberty made an extraordinary distribution of $614.4332 per $1,000 original principal amount of the Debentures attributable to the cash distribution made to former holders of common stock of Time Warner Cable, Inc. (“TWC”) on May 18, 2016, in connection with the mergers involving Charter Communications, Inc. and TWC (the “Charter/TWC Merger”). The extraordinary distribution was based on the “average transaction consideration” paid in the Charter/TWC Merger, as that term is defined in the Indenture for the Debentures..Reductions to the principal amount of the Debentures do not affect the amount of the quarterly interest payments received by holders of the Debentures, which will continue to be a rate equal to 0.75% per annum of the original principal amount of the Debentures. Below is a detail of the amount of the quarterly interest payment being made on the Debentures, its allocation between payment of interest and repayment of principal and the revised adjusted principal amount of the Debentures resulting from such payment, per $1,000 original principal amount of the Debentures:.December 30, 2017.Beginning Adjusted.Principal.Payment Interest Payment of.Principal.December 30, 2017.Ending Adjusted.Principal.$379.7849 $1.875 $0.7121 $1.1629 $378.6220 Liberty also announced the payment today, to holders of the Debentures as of December 15, 2017, of an additional distribution of $2.1041 per Debenture, which is attributable to the regular quarterly dividends paid by Time Warner Inc. of $0.4025 on November 1, 2017 and by Time Inc. of $0.0400 on December 15, 2017.

{'input': ' 11 PM / Updated 10 minutes ago Liverpools Van Dijk primed for derby debut in cup Neil Robinson 5 Min Read .(Reuters) - Virgil van Dijk, the world’s most expensive defender, could make his Liverpool debut against local rivals Everton at Anfield in Friday night’s opening FA Cup third-round clash. FILE PHOTO - Soccer Football - Premier League - Liverpool vs Leicester City - Anfield, Liverpool, Britain - December 30, 2017 Former Liverpool defender Virgil van Dijk before the match REUTERS/Phil Noble .The centre back is eligible to play after his registration was finalised following his protracted 75 million pound move from Southampton. .Manager Juergen Klopp has yet to say whether he intends to plunge the Dutchman straight into action, particularly in such a high-profile game, but Van Dijk is likely to feature at least on the bench. .The shape of Klopp’s team is further complicated by British media reports that Barcelona are about to table a bid for Brazilian midfielder Philippe Coutinho. Meanwhile, Mo Salah and Sadio Mane may not feature in Friday’s game after the German agreed to allow them to attend the African Footballer of the Year awards in Ghana on Thursday. .A private plane will fly them back with Klopp seemingly relaxed about the unusual arrangements. “We have two of the three best African players in our squad. We have to show them respect. We are going to sleep in a hotel the night before the match, they are going to sleep on a plane. That is the only difference,” he said. .With Manchester City so far ahead in the Premier League, the FA Cup, which Liverpool last won in 2006, may represent Klopp’s best chance of winning his first trophy at the club, although Everton always represent a formidable barrier. Last month they drew 1-1 at Anfield and have never lost a cup tie against their neighbours there. .All four previous Anfield derbies in the FA Cup, stretching back 116 years, have been drawn, most recently 1-1 in 2009 when Everton won the replay. VAR TECHNOLOGY .Friday’s other tie pits 2016 champions Manchester United against Derby County, who are second in the Championship, while neighbours City play Burnley on Saturday. .To the dismay of purists, the draw has been staggered over four days with Monday’s final game between Brighton & Hove Albion and Crystal Palace marking the first time video assistant referee (VAR) will be used in a major English game. .The technology will be restricted to three “game-changing” situations -- goals, penalties and straight red cards -- at a time when referees have been criticised for getting high-profile decisions wrong. .Last week in the league, Arsenal were on the wrong end of a harsh handball penalty decision which led to a late equaliser for West Bromwich Albion. The FA Cup holders will be hoping for better luck when they begin their defence of a competition they have won three times in the past four years at managerless Nottingham Forest on Sunday. .Shrewsbury are among the lower division teams scenting a traditional third-round upset against higher-ranked opponents. The Shrews, who sit second in the third-tier League One, face a West Ham United side prioritising top-tier survival and playing their third game in six days. .Another Premier League struggler, West Brom, may be troubled at League Two side Exeter City while last season’s losing finalists Chelsea travel to Norwich City from the Championship. .Unusually, no non-league teams have made it through to the third round but the draw has pitted several players against their former teams. .The best known is Leicester City’s Jamie Vardy, who returns to Fleetwood Town, who were a non-league side when the striker left them in 2012 after scoring 31 goals in 36 games. .Fleetwood, who are now managed by former Manchester City striker Uwe Rosler, have progressed in his absence and are now 12th in League One. .Perhaps the third-round’s biggest cheer will be heard at Brentford’s Griffin Park where Republic of Ireland international Alan Judge is slated for his first game in 21 months, against his former side Notts County. .The midfielder has not played since breaking his leg in three places against Ipswich Town in April 2016 but has been told by manager Dean Smith that, after appearing on the Brentford bench for a couple of games, he will play on Saturday. .Judge’s horrific injury required two operations to heal and deprived the 29-year-old of the chance to appear at Euro 2016 and a likely Premier League move. .“I didn’t watch football for a year,” he said ahead of his comeback. “I watched little bits here or there, but I didn’t watch Brentford play for over a year, until I knew I was getting fit and I knew I was getting back”. .On Saturday, the long wait will be over.

{'input': 'January 2, 2018 / 1:27 AM / Updated 4 hours ago Oil hits highest since mid-2015, then dips Dmitry Zhdannikov , Devika Krishna Kumar 4 Min Read .LONDON (Reuters) - Oil prices eased on Tuesday after hitting mid-2015 highs in early trading, as major pipelines in Libya and the UK restarted and U.S production soared to the highest in more than four decades. .It was the first time since January 2014 that the two crude oil benchmarks opened the year above $60 per barrel, buoyed by large anti-government rallies in Iran and ongoing supply cuts led by OPEC and Russia. .U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures CLc1 traded 20 cents lower at around $60.22 a barrel by 11:34 a.m. EST (1634 GMT). In early trading WTI hit $60.74, the highest since June 2015. .Brent crude futures LCOc1, the international benchmark, were down 53 cents, or 0.8 percent at $66.34 a barrel. The session high of $67.29 was the highest since May 2015. .The spread between U.S. crude and Brent WTCLc1-LCoc1 hit the narrowest in nearly two weeks. .The 450,000 barrel per day (bpd) capacity Forties pipeline system in the North Sea returned to full operations on Dec. 30 after an unplanned shutdown. .Repairs have been finished on a Libyan oil pipeline damaged in a suspected attack last week and production is restarting gradually, engineers said. .“The resolution of the North Sea pipeline issue is having the expected result that the Brent-WTI spread is narrowing today,” David Thompson, executive vice-president at Powerhouse, an energy-specialized commodities broker in Washington. .Thompson added that traders have been returning to work from the holidays, boosting volumes. .“Despite the day’s price weakness, both Brent and WTI remain in solid, long-term bullish trends - $58.95 is nearby support on WTI front-month futures and $65.60 is the corresponding support on front-month Brent futures,” Thompson said. .Iran’s Supreme Leader on Tuesday accused the country’s enemies of stirring unrest, as the death toll rose to 21 from anti-government demonstrations that began last week.[nL8N1OX0XY] FILE PHOTO: A view shows the French oil giant Total refinery in Donges, France, November 21, 2017. REUTERS/Stephane Mahe .Iran is OPEC’s third largest crude producer. Iranian oil industry and shipping sources said protests have had no impact so far on oil production or exports. .“Geopolitical risks are clearly back on the crude oil agenda after having been absent almost entirely since the oil market ran into a surplus in the second half of 2014,” Bjarne Schieldrop, chief commodities analyst at SEB, said, also citing Kurdistan and Libya. .Oil markets have been supported by a year of production cuts led by the Middle East-dominated Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and Russia. The cuts started in January 2017 and are scheduled to cover all of 2018. .U.S. commercial crude oil inventories have fallen by almost 20 percent from their historic highs last March, to 431.9 million barrels. .Strong demand growth, especially from China, has also been supporting crude. .However, rising U.S. production, which is on the verge of breaking through 10 million bpd, has tempered the bullish outlook. .“We think U.S. tight oil production growth warrants close monitoring as it could spoil OPEC’s market-balancing efforts, pushing the market into surplus in 2018,” Barclays bank said. .October U.S crude production rose 167,000 barrels per day to 9.64 million bpd, according to the EIA’s monthly production report.

REUTERS/Arnd Wiegmann/File Photo .The massive $1.5 trillion tax overhaul that U.S. President Donald Trump signed into law last month cuts the corporate rate from 35 percent to 21 percent and temporarily reduces the tax burden for most individuals as well. .BP, like many other international companies, said it expected a positive impact to its U.S. earnings in the long run. .But in the short term, lower tax rates will affect its deferred tax assets and liabilities, resulting in a one-off, non-cash charge of $1.5 billion to its 2017 fourth quarter results which are due to be announced on Feb. 8, it said. .“The ultimate impact of the change in the U.S. corporate income tax rate is subject to a number of complex provisions in the legislation which BP is reviewing,” BP said in a statement. .The British company’s shares were down 1.15 percent by 1534 GMT. .The adjustment will not impact BP’s cash flow in the fourth quarter. .Deferred tax assets refer in some cases to a company overpaying taxes in advance and then getting them back in the form of tax relief. .BP has large operations in oil and gas production in the Gulf of Mexico and onshore shale operations as well as refineries that can process up to 746,000 barrels per day of crude oil, according to its website. .Shell said last week it would incur a one-off charge of $2-$2.5 billion, although the new legislation would have a “favourable” impact on earnings. .On Dec. 22, Trump signed the tax overhaul into law, cutting tax rates for businesses and offering some temporary cuts for some individuals and families.

As such, it is interesting that the SEC, after looking at this case for a year without taking any action—including allowing the Company to continue to raise approximately $350 million—now suddenly decides to step in after the new, independent management team has accomplished substantial work to reorganize the business and its financial structure..“We believe the time-tested Chapter 11 process, paired with the business expertise of the new independent management team, best protects the interests of creditors, offers them a voice in the process and will maximize recovery. The SEC’s action could cause irreparable harm to Woodbridge investors and other creditors – dramatically alter the Company’s rights, impair and deplete assets of the estate and hinder the reorganization efforts.”.“The SEC’s current action would erase the extensive efforts the Company’s independent management has taken to bring transparency to the business and maximize recoveries for all the Company’s constituents,” said Sam Newman, partner at Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP and counsel to Woodbridge..Since the appointments of Beilinson Advisory Group and Chief Restructuring Officer, Larry Perkins, new management has focused on protecting investors and maximizing the estate for the benefit all stakeholders..Specific actions include:.Immediately ceased all fundraising, which was the subject of the SEC’s investigation—an action protecting the public good. Commenced Chapter 11 cases to maximize value for the benefit of all stakeholders. Implemented a process to protect the value of the Company’s assets , evaluate the Company’s obligations to its creditors, resolve their claims promptly, and make appropriate use of the Bankruptcy Code to ensure a fair and equitable distribution.

The 32-year-old serial entrepreneur just sold Shipt — the same-day grocery delivery business he founded in Birmingham, Ala. in 2014 — to Target for $550 million . .Here, the self-made millionaire and businessman tells CNBC Make It the two books that have helped him find success. Rich Dad Poor Dad .Before I really started my first business, I read  Rich Dad Poor Dad , Smith tells CNBC Make It. In the book, author Robert Kiyosaki writes about the two father figures in his life and how they shaped his views on personal finance. But the book also had personal significance for Smith. .Its kind of a story about the one dad that has a PhD and this fancy college education, and the guy next door just works hard and goes out and hustles every day, and hes the rich dad. .That kind of made me feel like Hey I dont really need to have to college to go make stuff happen. I can go do this, so that was an important book to me. .Smith dropped out of high school and then after receiving his GED, went to college for a brief stint but never finished. Smith says he thinks education is great, but not necessary to be an entrepreneur. .I think that business is all about getting out there and solving problems, and I dont know if you can really teach entrepreneurship, Smith says. So I just tell people you gotta get out there and start making it happen. .Smith isnt the only successful person who has touted the benefits of the book. NFL wide receiver Ryan Broyles recently revealed that he and his wife lived on roughly $60,000 a year throughout his career, despite having once signed a $3.6 million contract with the Detroit Lions. (He is currently a free agent.) Lessons Broyles learned from the popular book focused on how to make your money work for you. .The Poor Dads philosophy basically reinforced the way I already thought about money: Make money to live, and save some along the way, Broyles wrote in The Players Tribune . But the Rich Dads lessons — making your money work for you by investing it and acquiring income-generating assets — made me realize that I needed to make changes in how I thought about money if I ever wanted to be that Rich Dad. Good to Great: Why Some Companies Make the Leap and Others Dont .I really enjoyed Good to Great, which is a little bit of an older book now, but its a good book about how to build companies that can stand the test of time, Smith tells CNBC Make It of the tome by Jim Collins. .Smith is in good company; Jeff Bezos, founder and CEO of e-commerce behemoth Amazon, has also reportedly credited the book for helping shape his leadership style and way of thinking. Amazon executives were briefed by author Collins on many of the principles laid out in the book before its publication, according to Brad Stone , who wrote a biography on Bezos. .The book analyzes companies that make the leap from good results to great results and then are able to sustain that success.

REUTERS/Carlos Barria “Since taking office I have been very strict on Commercial Aviation.

In remarks to airline executives in February, he did not raise safety but criticized the “regulatory morass” affecting the industry..Sanders said Trump “has raised the bar for our nation’s aviation safety and security,” citing his proposal to privatise air traffic control, which has not been approved, and the Homeland Security Department’s enhanced security measures..In March, the United States imposed restrictions on passengers carrying laptops in cabins on nine primarily Middle Eastern airlines to address the potential threat of hidden explosives. It lifted the restrictions in July after announcing new security requirements..In a tongue-in-cheek thank you to Trump, actor Bryan Cranston, who starred in TV’s ”Breaking Bad,’ tweeted: “Your active participation monitoring the flight patterns and safety regulations was greatly appreciated.

FILE PHOTO: FILE PHOTO: A BP logo is seen at a petrol station in London, January 15, 2015.

It cuts the corporate rate from 35 percent to 21 percent and temporarily reduces the tax burden for most individuals as well. .But BP said that in the short term, lower tax rates will affect its deferred tax assets and liabilities, resulting in a one-off, non-cash charge of $1.5 billion to its 2017 fourth quarter results which are due to be announced on Feb. 8. .“The ultimate impact of the change in the U.S. corporate income tax rate is subject to a number of complex provisions in the legislation which BP is reviewing,” BP said in a statement. .The British company’s shares closed down about 1 percent on Tuesday. .The adjustment will not affect BP’s cash flow in the fourth quarter. .Exxon Mobil Corp, the world’s largest publicly traded oil producer, declined to comment on how the U.S. tax changes would financially affect it. .Chevron Corp said it was studying the changes but still plans to invest $8 billion in the United States this year. .Deferred tax assets refer in some cases to a company overpaying taxes in advance and then getting them back in the form of tax relief. .BP has large operations in oil and gas production in the Gulf of Mexico and onshore shale operations as well as refineries that can process up to 746,000 barrels per day of crude oil, according to its website. .On Dec. 22, Trump signed the tax overhaul into law, cutting tax rates for businesses and offering some temporary cuts for some individuals and families.

{'input': 'McAfee Acquires the Worldwide Leader in the CASB Market Segment.SANTA CLARA, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- McAfee today announced the completion of its previously announced acquisition of Skyhigh Networks. With the close of this deal, Skyhigh Networks becomes part of the McAfee Cloud Security Business Unit..This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180103006074/en/.Chris Young, McAfee CEO (left) and Rajiv Gupta, Skyhigh Networks CEO (right) (Photo: Business Wire).Skyhigh is an ideal complement to McAfee’s strategy – one focused on building and optimizing mission-critical cybersecurity environments for the future. Skyhigh Networks pioneered the cloud access security broker (CASB) market segment that analysts describe as one of the fastest growing areas of information security investments of the last five years. With this technology, McAfee can now offer a cloud portfolio that addresses the three primary challenges of managing multi-cloud environments—visibility into networks, workloads and data, advanced threat protection and pervasive data protection..“Today’s announcement marks a new milestone for the future of our company,” said Chris Young, chief executive officer, McAfee. “With two industry leaders coming together under one company, we will make cybersecurity an enabler to the transformative power of our digital age. We are focused on securing customers from their devices to the cloud, giving customers access to market-leading capabilities in the architectural control points that matter most.”.According to McAfee’s 2017 cloud adoption and security report, Building Trust in a Cloudy Sky , 93% of organizations use some form of cloud services. McAfee cloud security solutions provide visibility, advanced threat protection, and data protection controls across all clouds to secure network traffic, workloads, and data. The multi-cloud security management of Skyhigh Security Cloud (Skyhigh), McAfee Cloud Workload Security (McAfee CWS) and McAfee Virtual Network Security Platform (McAfee vNSP) allows administrators to identify and secure critical cloud resources..Security professionals know the importance of the cloud, but need a way to ensure their networks, workloads and data are all protected. McAfee solutions help in the following ways:.Visibility into the Cloud.McAfee cloud security solutions help organizations identify where their critical resources reside in the cloud. Skyhigh identifies sensitive information using keywords, data patterns, fingerprints, metadata, and file types – and analyzes behavior across all cloud services, users, and devices. McAfee CWS allows administrators to apply security controls across multiple cloud infrastructure environments, to discover and monitor potentially thousands of cloud workloads and virtual networks. Additionally, with McAfee vNSP, administrators can inspect and analyze all traffic to, from, and within cloud environments..Threat Prevention.Threat prevention measures are implemented to layer protection across networks, workloads, and files, so that administrators can take immediate and automated remediative action. McAfee CWS monitors cloud workload configuration profiles, prevents advanced threats with machine learning, and applies application whitelisting to automatically enforce workload compliance policies. In parallel, McAfee vNSP provides the opportunity to visualize threat sources within log flows, and uses sandboxing, dynamic behavioral analysis, and machine learning to stop threats from traversing the network. Skyhigh detects unusual behavior indicative of an insider threat, compromised account, or privileged user threat..Data Protection.Skyhigh helps identify and control access to sensitive information already in, moving to, or originating in the cloud. Administrators can consistently enforce sharing permissions within applications, manage access controls across multiple environments, restrict the ability to download sensitive data to unmanaged devices – controlling the potential for oversharing information – and protect both structured and unstructured data with information rights management and encryption..What customers are saying:.“McAfee’s acquisition of Skyhigh Networks brings two security leaders together,” said Ivaylo Uzunov, manager of Information Security at Carlson Wagonlit Travel. “The integration of their security offerings will provide a holistic data visibility and control for cloud applications, while preserving policy enforcement and compliance.”.What partners are saying:.“One of the main issues our customers are trying to tackle is how to protect their sensitive data in the cloud,” said Darren Carroll, Director Security and Risk Management Practice, SHI. “They need to understand the applications in use, and where their data exists, and how users are interacting with their most critical assets. Through the Skyhigh Cloud Security Platform, we can offer security administrators market leading capabilities to protect their sensitive data by monitoring, orchestrating and managing data security across multiple cloud environments. This allows us to bring end-to-end security from devices to cloud services so that companies can adopt the cloud to accelerate their businesses.”.“As Optiv’s clients continue migrating at an exceptional pace to cloud environments, they need support to make clarity out of the chaos to better secure their cloud data,” said John Turner, senior director, cloud security for Optiv. “CASB technologies are a critical part of any cloud security strategy, and we’re pleased to see one of our key partners, McAfee, expand their product portfolio by acquiring a CASB leader like Skyhigh Networks. These technologies are a critical piece of Optiv’s comprehensive suite of solutions and services that help organizations remove complexity and maximize protection while optimizing their investments.”.Resources:.McAfee Cloud Security Solutions Website Video message from Chris Young and Rajiv Gupta Blog Trust in the Cloud Infographic.About McAfee.McAfee is one of the world’s leading independent cybersecurity companies.

They viewed economic activity as rising at a solid rate, and the labor market as continuing to strengthen..The Fed has forecast three rate hikes for 2018.

{'input': 'January 2, 2018 / 8:11 AM / Updated 8 hours ago Murray fears for Melbourne after Brisbane withdrawal Reuters Staff 3 Min Read .(Reuters) - Former world number one Andy Murray’s lingering hip issues forced him to withdraw from the Brisbane International on Tuesday with the Briton admitting he was unsure whether he could recover in time for the Australian Open later this month. .Murray has not played a competitive match since a Wimbledon quarter-final loss last July due to the complaint and despite coming through a one-set exhibition in Abu Dhabi last week, he was unable to train on Tuesday and announced his withdrawal. .“I‘m very disappointed to be withdrawing from the Brisbane International,” Murray, seeded second in Brisbane, told tournament organizers before going into further detail of his predicament in an emotional post on social media. .“Having been recommended to treat my hip conservatively since the U.S. Open, I have done everything asked of me from a rehab perspective and worked extremely hard to try get back on the court competing,” Murray said on his Instagram account. .”Having played practice sets here in Brisbane with some top players unfortunately this hasn’t worked yet to get me to the level I would like so I have to reassess my options. Continuing rehab is one option and giving my hip more time to recover. .“Surgery is also an option but the chances of a successful outcome are not as high as I would like which has made this my secondary option and my hope has been to avoid that. However, this is something I may have to consider but let’s hope not.” .The world number 16 had been due to play his first tournament match of the season on Thursday with a second-round encounter against American Ryan Harrison at Pat Rafter Arena. He will be replaced by German lucky loser Yannick Hanfmann. .Murray, who said on Sunday that he planned to trim his schedule in 2018 to prevent a recurrence of his injury issues, will remain in Brisbane for the rest of the week before planning his next move. .“In the short term I‘m going to be staying in Australia for the next couple of days to see if my hip settles down a bit and will decide by the weekend whether to stay out here or fly home to assess what I do next,” the 30-year-old added. .“Sorry for the long post but I wanted to keep everyone in the loop and get this off my chest as it’s really hurting inside.” .Brisbane tournament director Cameron Pearson wished the three-times grand slam winner well. .“I‘m really disappointed for Andy, as I know how much he was looking forward to getting his season started in Brisbane,” he said. .“As a two-time former champion, he has great memories of playing on Pat Rafter Arena and thrilling his fans. I wish him all the best to be ready to play the Australian Open.” .Murray’s latest injury setback will also come as a blow to Australian Open organizers ahead of the year’s first major in Melbourne starting on Jan. 15, along with those of fellow “Big Four” members Rafael Nadal (back) and Novak Djokovic (elbow).

{'input': 'FRANKFURT/BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany’s IG Metall labor union called on staff at Volkswagen’s ( VOWG_p.DE ) Porsche sports car brand to walk off their shifts for about an hour on Thursday as part of its campaign for higher pay across the engineering industry..The country’s biggest union is demanding a 6 percent wage rise this year for about 3.9 million workers in the metal and engineering sectors, including the German car industry..It is entitled to stage walkouts after a non-strike period ended on Sunday and many workers usually respond to its calls for action..The union, which also wants a shorter working week, plans to expand stoppages across Germany from next Monday to step up pressure on employers before the next round of pay negotiations, due on Jan. 11..Employers have dismissed the pay claim as excessive and have so far offered only a 2 percent raise as well as a 200 euro ($240.50) one-off payment in the first quarter..Porsche, the second-biggest contributor to Volkswagen (VW) group profit, assembles the 911 and Boxster models at its core factory in Zuffenhausen where the so-called warning strikes have been called..“The current stance of the employers’ lobby is a provocation to workers,” Porsche works council chief Uwe Hueck said in an emailed statement..“The metal and engineering industry has never before made so much profit. That’s why there is only one appropriate response: Warning strikes.”.The Suedwestmetall employers’ lobby in Baden-Wuerttemberg, where Porsche, Daimler ( DAIGn.DE ) and components supplier Robert Bosch [ROBG.UL] are based, denounced the union’s strike plans..“The fact that employees are laying down their work already before the planned warning strikes on Jan. 8 is irresponsible and is placing an unnecessary burden on further talks,” Peer-Michael Dick, managing director of Suedwestmetall said by email..Several hundred workers at companies in Volkswagen’s home-state of Lower Saxony, including Bosch, laid down their tools on Tuesday in support of IG Metall’s calls for higher wages..Reporting by Ilona Wissenbach and Andreas Cremer; Editing by Adrian Croft.

{'input': 'January 4, 2018 / 10:23 AM / Updated 15 minutes ago Labours economic plan is high-risk gamble, says party education chief Reuters Staff 2 Min Read .LONDON (Reuters) - The opposition Labour Party’s proposal for a sharp increase in state-funded investment is a high-risk economic strategy, Labour’s education policy chief said in an interview published on Thursday. Britains Labour Party leader, Jeremy Corbyn (L), speaks with shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer, John McDonnell, at the Labour Party conference in Liverpool, Britain September 26, 2016. REUTERS/Darren Staples .The socialist leadership of Britain’s second largest party has promised a range of sweeping economic reforms if it wrestles power from Prime Minister Theresa May’s Conservatives, including a debt-funded 250 billion pound 10-year investment plan. .“We are in different times, radical times where we need to have a real investment in Britain’s future. Genuinely. I don’t mean that as a slogan, I mean it as an economic strategy,” Angela Rayner, Labour’s would-be education minister told the Spectator magazine. .“It’s a high-risk strategy. But all of Britain’s great advancements in the past have been because we’ve had the gumption to take a risk.” .Labour performed much better than expected in a June national election, depriving May of an outright majority in parliament. That has pushed investors to seriously consider the prospect of Labour taking power sooner than the next scheduled election in 2022. .Morgan Stanley cautioned investors on Nov. 26 that political uncertainty in Britain was a bigger threat than Brexit given the risk of Corbyn winning power and then dismantling what was once seen as one of the world’s most stable free-market economies. .Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn later hit back at the bank, saying: “They’re right: We’re a threat to a damaging and failed system that is rigged for the few.” .Asked about Rayner’s remarks, a Labour Party spokeswoman said: “Angela was saying that we have a once in a generation opportunity, with historically low interest rates, to invest in our infrastructure, new technologies and our people, underpinned by our Fiscal Credibility Rule - and that we must take it.” .Labour’s proposed Fiscal Credibility Rule is designed to ensure it only borrows to invest in capital projects which will, over time, pay for themselves.

{'input': 'January 1, 2018 / 11:33 PM / Updated 2 hours ago Hyundai Motor, Kia Motors flag slow sales growth in 2018 Hyunjoo Jin , Joyce Lee 3 Min Read .SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea’s Hyundai Motor and Kia Motors on Tuesday flagged only modest sales growth in 2018, suggesting a slow recovery from a slump linked to their lack of SUVs in the United States and diplomatic tensions with China. Hyundai Motor Group Vice Chairman Yoon Yeo-chul speaks during the companys New Year ceremony in Seoul, South Korea, January 2, 2018. REUTERS/Kim Hong-Ji .Hyundai and smaller affiliate Kia, which together make the world’s fifth-largest automaker, said demand was expected to soften in the U.S. and Chinese markets as they unveiled a combined sales target of 7.55 million vehicles this year. .Analysts said that would be a slight increase on 2017, when the automakers are estimated to have sold about 7.3 million vehicles, their lowest in five years. .“The target for Hyundai and Kia is lower than expected. It seems to be a conservative target, reflecting a slow recovery in China and ongoing U.S difficulties,” Kim Jin-woo, an analyst at Korea Investment & Securities said. .The 2017 sales figures are due out later on Tuesday but analysts expect the South Korean duo to fall well short of their target of 8.25 million vehicles, marking their third consecutive annual miss. .Hyundai Motor shares declined 2.2 percent after falling as much as 4.5 percent on Tuesday morning, and Kia Motors stocks were down more than 1.6 percent. The broader market rose 0.2 percent. .The firms’ sales tumbled last year in China, the world’s largest auto market, amid a chill between Beijing and Seoul over South Korea’s deployment of a U.S. anti-missile system. Employees of Hyundai Motor walk past a Hyundai Genesis G70 after the companys New Year ceremony in Seoul, South Korea, January 2, 2018. REUTERS/Kim Hong-Ji .Sales in China and the United States were also hurt by a failure to capitalize on surging demand for sports utility vehicles (SUVs). .While Hyundai Motor has plans to offer more SUVs in the United States and China, analysts said new models such as the redesigned Santa Fe SUV may come too late in the year to significantly impact sales. FILE PHOTO: Hyundai Motors vehicles are displayed at a Hyundai Motorstudio in Goyang, South Korea May 29, 2017. REUTERS/Kim Hong-Ji .The expiration of a tax cut on small-engine cars in China also would be a negative for Hyundai’s sedan-heavy line-up, they said. .Hyundai Motor Group Chairman Chung Mon-koo said in a statement the South Korean automakers would launch 12 new or refreshed models this year. .They would “actively venture into” new markets like Southeast Asia, as protectionism was expected to grow elsewhere, he added. .South Korea and the United States will hold talks on a trade deal on Jan. 5 although U.S. President Donald Trump has threatened to withdraw from the pact. .Chung, 79, skipped his annual New Year speech to employees for a second year in a row.

{'input': 'As the first trading day of 2018 wrapped up on a rosy note for the averages , CNBCs Jim Cramer noticed a hint of discord in the market layout..I swear people are bored with whats going on with stocks, the  Mad Money  host said. Either they dont want to say anything good about the market because of politics, as the president has done a very good job of linking himself with the performance of the averages, or theyre just prone to sleep..Whatever the reason, the 54 percent of U.S. citizens who do own stocks should be entering the year on a high note, Cramer said..With the S&P 500 having gained nearly 20 percent overall for 2017, investors have likely benefited from the monster rallies that rocketed nearly every sector higher, he said..Thats what progress is all about. Is it related to President Trumps policies? Look, love him or hate him, the answer is yes, Cramer said. The president has created a pro-growth environment and along with a new tax code that will take money from the government ... and give it to the corporations..President Donald Trumps Twitter posts echo, if not embolden, this very message. On Sunday, he tweeted:.If the Dems (Crooked Hillary) got elected, your stocks would be down 50% from values on Election Day. Now they have a great future - and just beginning!.But for those in states like New York, New Jersey and California, Cramer said the new tax law (and its alleged burdens on blue states ) might overshadow the markets impressive 2017 gains..Still, Cramer argued that individual stock-picking will benefit red- and blue-state investors alike in the new year, particularly in the technology sector..After brushing off Apples battery gate problems as a momentary lapse with an easy fix, Cramer turned to the semiconductor space for investing ideas..After being under pressure for most of December, semiconductor stocks seem to be revitalized and some of the key contributors to the rally, the Mad Money host said..The highest multiple tech stocks — the Adobes , the Salesforces , the VMwares — are finally on the move after being stuck in the mud, he said. I think that theyre all buys. VMwares really way too low given that blowout quarter ..Oil and retail stocks are also coming back to life thanks to rising crude prices and a robust holiday shopping season , respectively, and transports seem to be riding the holiday trend with them as e-commerce grows, Cramer said..Commodities are on the come-up, and even biotechnology stocks like Celgene and Gilead caught wind on Tuesday, securing some buyers after a difficult end to 2017 ..I could go on and on, Cramer said. But the bottom line is simple: for whatever reason, the animal spirits triggered by the presidents focus on deregulation , the bonuses being given to workers after the tax cut , the weaker dollar going into the earnings, the boom in the Southeast because of a glut of natural gas , the coming boost in earnings estimates thanks to the slashing of corporate taxes , weve got an incredible rally, and this kind of move is never boring. Its not a bull; its a beast. And right now, its in beast mode..WATCH: Cramer discusses Trumps effect on the beast market show chapters Cramer reflects on how Trumps actions are fueling the beast market rally 20 Hours Ago | 12:19 Disclosure: Cramers charitable trust owns shares of Apple..Questions for Cramer?.Call Cramer: 1-800-743-CNBC.Want to take a deep dive into Cramers world?

{'input': 'President Donald Trump signaled his willingness on Thursday to provide protections for Dreamers but only if a deal includes a border wall with Mexico and tightens immigration restrictions..Trump made his comments to reporters during a meeting with Republican senators to discuss immigration policy, including a March deadline to restore protections under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program..Any legislation on DACA must secure the border with a wall, it must give our immigration officers the resources they need to stop illegal immigration, and also to stop these overstays, Trump said..Crucially, this legislation must stop chain migration, and it must end the visa lottery, he added, and I think many of the Democrats agree with us on that..Trump then described, incorrectly, how the green card lottery system works. He implied that other countries get to decide who can enter the lottery, which is in fact administered by the U.S. State Department.

{'input': 'BOSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- resTORbio, Inc., a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of novel therapeutics for the treatment of aging-related diseases, today announced that Lynne Sullivan, Senior Vice President of Finance for Biogen, Inc. has joined the resTORbio board of directors as an independent director. Ms. Sullivan will serve as the chair of the Audit Committee..“We are excited to have Lynne join our board of directors at such an important stage in resTORbio’s growth,” said Chen Schor, President and CEO of resTORbio. “We are fortunate to benefit from Lynne’s extensive experience in finance, accounting, financial planning and strategy, as we grow a sustainable company with novel therapeutics for aging-related diseases.”.Lynne Sullivan said, “I am enthusiastic to be joining resTORbio’s board of directors, and I believe the company’s approach is well-suited to address aging-related diseases. As a first indication, the potential to address the important public health issue of respiratory tract infections in the elderly is significant on many levels.”.Ms. Sullivan is currently the Senior Vice President of Finance for Biogen, Inc., where she has worked since 2008. Ms. Sullivan has global responsibility for Biogen’s Financial Planning & Analysis, Corporate Tax, and Corporate Finance groups, which includes ownership of long-range planning, capital allocation projects and the financial aspects of Mergers & Acquisitions/Business Development. Previously, Ms. Sullivan was the Vice President of Tax for Biogen, Vice President Tax for EMD Serono and the Vice President of Tax North America at Merck KgaA. She was also a Tax Partner at Arthur Anderson, where she led the North East Region’s Tax Consulting Practice for the firm. Ms. Sullivan is on the Board of Solid Biosciences LLC, where she has chaired the Audit Committee since 2015. Ms. Sullivan holds a B.S. in Accounting from Suffolk University and a M.S. in Taxation from Bentley College..About Respiratory Tract Infections (RTIs) in the Elderly.The decline in immune function that occurs during aging, or immunosenescence, increases susceptibility to a variety of diseases, including respiratory tract infections, or RTIs, that significantly contribute to morbidity and mortality in the elderly. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, RTIs are the fifth leading cause of death in people age 85 and over and the seventh leading cause of death in people age 65 and over. RTIs also result in high healthcare costs for the elderly population and burden the healthcare system. The majority of RTIs are caused by viruses for which there are no FDA-approved therapies. As the elderly represent the fastest growing population in the world, there is significant unmet medical need for innovative therapeutic options to reduce the incidence of RTIs by enhancing the function of the aging immune system..About TORC1.Mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a protein serine/threonine kinase that regulates the process of aging and aging-related diseases and conditions, via two complexes: TORC1 and TORC2. TORC1 inhibition has been found to have many beneficial effects on aging-related diseases and conditions, while TORC2 inhibition has been associated with adverse events including hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia. The TORC1 inhibitor program being developed by resTORbio may, therefore, have therapeutic potential to ameliorate multiple aging-related diseases without the undesirable side effects associated with TORC2 inhibition..About resTORbio.resTORbio, Inc. is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of novel therapeutics for the treatment of aging-related diseases. resTORbio’s lead program is targeting the target of rapamycin complex 1 (TORC1) pathway to treat aging-related diseases and conditions with an initial focus on conditions caused by immunosenescence, the decline in immune function that occurs during aging. resTORbio’s lead product candidate, RTB101, alone or in combination with everolimus, is in a Phase 2b clinical trial to evaluate its potential in reducing the incidence of respiratory tract infections (RTI) in elderly subjects at increased risk of RTI-related morbidity and mortality. resTORbio’s lead program is supported by two Phase 2a clinical studies from which promising safety and efficacy signals were observed in almost 500 elderly subjects. resTORbio is pursuing a pragmatic clinical development plan to address areas of key unmet medical need in the aging population.

{'input': 'January 3, 2018 / 3:10 AM / Updated 7 hours ago Cricket-Smith fine, Starc set to return for fifth Ashes test Nick Mulvenney 3 Min Read .SYDNEY, Jan 3 (Reuters) - Australia captain Steve Smith suggested Mitchell Starc would be back to spearhead their pace attack against England on Thursday and brushed off concerns about his own fitness on the eve of the fifth and final Ashes test on Wednesday. .Left-arm quick Starc, the leading wicket-taker in the series after claiming 19 in the first three tests as Australia wrested back the Ashes, missed the drawn fourth test in Melbourne with a bruised heel but was back bowling in the nets on Tuesday. .“Starcy’s pulled up pretty well this morning and said he’s ready to go so I guess that’s a good indication,” Smith told reporters   Ground (SCG). .“The break that he’s had from bowling has helped his heel heal, it’s coming on nicely, he’s confident. You’ve got to take the player’s words sometimes, and hopefully he gets through fine, if he gets the opportunity.” .The Australia skipper, who has accumulated a series-leading 604 runs at an average of 151, did not name a side but left no one in any doubt that he would be leading it despite missing training on Tuesday because of a bad back. .“It’s a little bit stiff but nothing I haven’t dealt with before,” Smith said. .”I’ll have a good hit and a good catch today and I’ll be fine tomorrow. .“I love batting out here at the SCG, it’s my home ground and I’ve made a few good scores. So hopefully I can continue the run.” .Starc looks likely to return in place of Jackson Bird, who laboured as a stand-in on an Melbourne Cricket Ground pitch rated as “poor” by the governing International Cricket Council. .Left-arm tweaker Ashton Agar was also brought into the squad to offer Australia the option of going with two spinners if it looked like the SCG was going to offer a lot of turn. .Smith, though, said that it was unlikely that one of the quicks would make way for a second slow bowler in addition to off-spinner Nathan Lyon as the hosts look to wrap up the series 4-0. .“The wicket’s got a fair bit of grass and looks to be a pretty good wicket,” he added. .“I’d say we’d probably opt for just the one spinner. Nathan has done a terrific job throughout this series and I’d say we’d go that way.” (Editing by Amlan Chakraborty)', 'output': "[['Steve Smith', 'PERSON', 'Is_Member_Of', 'Australia', 'ORG/TEAM'], ['Mitchell Starc', 'PERSON', 'Participates_In', 'Ashes test', 'EVENT'], ['Mitchell Starc', 'PERSON', 'Control', 'Heel', 'BODY'], ['Australia', 'ORG/TEAM', 'Introduce', 'Starc', 'PERSON'], ['Australia', 'ORG/TEAM', 'Operate_In', 'SCG', 'GPE'], ['Starc', 'PERSON', 'Positive_Impact_On', 'Australia', 'ORG/TEAM'], ['Jackson Bird', 'PERSON', 'Participates_In', 'Ashes test', 'EVENT'], ['Ashton Agar', 'PERSON', 'Participates_In', 'Ashes test', 'EVENT'], ['Australia', 'ORG/TEAM', 'Control', 'Nathan Lyon', 'PERSON'], ['Australia', 'ORG/TEAM', 'Control', 'One spinner', 'PRODUCT'], ['SCG', 'GPE', 'Operate_In', 'Ashes test', 'EVENT']]", 'category': 'closed_qa'}

{'input': 'By Alan Murray 6:00 AM EST .After a restful holiday break I’m ready for what is sure to be an eventful New Year. .Here are five big business trends I’ll be watching: .1: Recession Watch. Apologies for being contrary; all signs point to a solid economy in 2018, with tax cuts boosting growth. But that’s precisely the reason to start worrying. The economic expansion is eight and a half years old, and this spring, it becomes the second longest on record. Unemployment is at all-time lows in 13 states . Wages are (finally) starting to rise. As a result, there’s a steadily growing danger that something will happen to end the streak—a spike in interest rates powered by the Fed; a collapse in the stock market caused by a re-valuation of tech companies; a trade war sparked by the President; or a nuclear standoff with Kim Jong-un, to name a few. None of these, by themselves, is a likely event; but together they represent an impressive flock of potential black swans circling an aging economic expansion. .2: AI advances. 2017 was the year AI leapt to the forefront of CEO consciousness. 2018 may be the year that the hype starts to become reality. At CEO Daily, we believe the explosion of connected devices spewing out data that can be transformed into intelligence by ever smarter machine-learning algorithms eventually will spark a new industrial revolution. But we also recognize there are long and variable lags. If you missed this smart piece by Greg Ip of the Wall Street Journal last week, take time to read it now. A belated burst of business productivity in 2018, if it happened, could help prolong the expansion and provide a much-needed boost to living standards. .3: The tech backlash builds. Expect to see this on multiple fronts in 2018, as retailers worry about Amazon’s growing dominance, media companies struggle in the Facebook-Google-Netflix vice grip, Congress continues its quest for information on how Russia, ISIS and other bad actors benefit from social networks, and concerns about cyber security and data privacy grow. One area to watch is antitrust enforcement, where the government’s suit to block the AT&T-Time Warner merger could presage a new approach to vertical integration that could ultimately threaten the FAANG firms. .4: The CEO Statesman is on the rise. For a host of reasons, CEOs are increasingly taking on social issues. Driving the trend: socially-conscious millennial workers, ineffective governments, and the need to build public trust in business. Expect to see more CEOs stepping up in 2018 . With the labor market tight, they need to show that their companies are doing good in the world to attract the best talent. .5: A changing workplace for women. The #MeToo movement has caused an abrupt shift in acceptable workplace behavior. Some worry that could result in a backlash, but I’m betting 2018 will mark a turning point for women in the workplace. .This essay was originally published in CEO Daily, Fortune’s morning newsletter for must-read business news.

Steinhoff said the timeline for the completion of the investigation remained uncertain..The company had reported a 1.4 billion euros ($1.69 billion) net profit in 2016 while its 2015 accounts showed earnings of 959 million euros, according to Steinhoff’s annual reports..“The latest information confirms what we’ve suspected all along (about the reliability of the results for 2015 and beyond),” one hedge fund manager said, declining to be named. “What we’re eagerly waiting for is the outcome of the PwC investigation.”.The accounting scandal marks a fall from grace for the retailer which has grown rapidly via an international M&A spree that began in 2011 with the acquisition of Conforama, Europe’s second biggest furniture retailer..It has also tainted the reputation of Steinhoff’s chairman and biggest shareholder Christo Wiese, considered one of South Africa’s most respected stewards of shareholder capital..Shares in Steinhoff, once dubbed Africa’s IKEA, have fallen around 90 percent since news of the accounting irregularities broke in early December, wiping 185 billion rand ($14.99 billion) off its market value..It warned then that there was a 2 billion euro ($2.4 billion) hole in its balance sheet and has since said that some credit facilities have been suspended or withdrawn as it grapples with more than 10 billion euros in outstanding debt..Separately, the company has been under investigation for suspected accounting fraud in Germany since 2015. It moved its primary share listing from Johannesburg to Frankfurt late that year..Four current and former managers are under suspicion of having overstated revenue at subsidiaries, prosecutors said..Steinhoff has said the German investigation relates to whether revenue was booked properly, and whether taxable profits were correctly declared..Steinhoff shares were up nearly 8 percent in Johannesburg at 1256 GMT..Editing by Ed Stoddard and Jane Merriman.

Soccer Football - Premier League - Stoke City vs Newcastle United - bet365 Stadium, Stoke-on-Trent, Britain - January 1, 2018 Stoke Citys Charlie Adam Action Images via Reuters/Carl Recine .Stoke are in danger of dropping into the relegation zone after Monday’s 1-0 home defeat by Newcastle United left the hosts two points ahead of 18th-placed West Ham United, having played two games more. .The Potters’ perilous position has piled the pressure on manager Mark Hughes, with some fans calling for him to be sacked. However, Adam believes it is the players that must take responsibility for the team’s record of five defeats in their last seven league games. .”We’re in the mix now,“ Adam told the club’s website (www.stokecityfc.com). ”We are down there fighting for survival, and we need to find some character to get us out of this mess. .“We need to stand up and be counted, because as a group of players, we are the ones who have put ourselves in the situation we’re in.” .The Scot said that Stoke should prioritise the league over FA Cup fixtures but urged the team to get a much-needed morale boost by beating Coventry City in the cup competition on Saturday. .“League form must take priority, but when you’re in this situation, you just have to win games. We have to look at ourselves, and get a win in the next game,” Adam added. .”The players have to keep going, and keep up the fight... As a team, we need to pick up points as soon as possible, and come the end of the season, hopefully it will be enough. .“Coventry City on Saturday is not going to be an easy test. They are going OK in League Two (fourth tier), so it is going to be a difficult game.” .Stoke return to league action with a trip to Manchester United on Jan. 15.

The funding, made under the EU’s programme for poorer EU regions, was meant for small business and Babis’s Agrofert would not qualify. It was however owned by Agrofert entities earlier and is now owned by Agrofert again. .Babis has been charged with subsidy fraud in the case but won parliamentary immunity in the election. The lower house is expected to vote on lifting his immunity in the coming weeks. .The EU’s OLAF has completed its investigation of the case and sent recommendations to the Czech authorities. The report has not been released so far, with a Czech state attorney saying it could impede investigation. .It is up to regional Czech authorities to decide on the European Commission and the Finance Ministry recommendation. Officials there were not immediately available for comment.

Varlitinib is currently being studied in gastric, biliary tract, breast and colorectal cancers.

{'input': 'January 3, 2018 / 6:20 AM / Updated 27 minutes ago Cricket-Englands punt on leggie Crane not a short position Nick Mulvenney 4 Min Read .SYDNEY, Jan 3 (Reuters) - Mason Crane’s introduction to test cricket for   clash with Australia is perhaps a sign that England are finally prepared to invest the time it takes to develop a decent leg-spinner, whatever the short-term cost. .At 20, Crane will be the youngest England spinner for 90 years to make a test debut when he wins his first cap   on Thursday in a series that England trail by an irretrievable 3-0. .In the corresponding fixture on the 2013-14 Ashes series, when England were 4-0 down, Scott Borthwick, Boyd Rankin and Gary Ballance were all handed debuts with only the latter going on to play a second test. .Crane’s elevation after taking 75 wickets at 44 in 29 first class matches could be seen in the same vein but for Joe Root’s assertion to the contrary as he plots a win that he thinks is vital to England’s success on their next trip Down Under. .“I want us to be the best side in the world ... and it’s not going to happen by chucking guys in for the last game of a series,” he said. .“So it’s really important that we do it in a way which, over the next four years, gets us in the best place to perform well here, but throughout that period being as successful as we can be.” .The art of spinning the ball away from a right-handed batsman using the fingers and a full flick of the wrist can produce spectacular results but also be difficult to control. .It has provided two of the most memorable moments in Ashes cricket - the Eric Hollies googly that bowled Don Bradman in the great Australian’s final innings and the “Ball of the Century” with which Shane Warne dismissed Mike Gatting in 1993. .It can also be an expensive, though, as Warne had discovered on his test debut at the SCG the previous year when he took 1-150 against India. .While Warne was the greatest in a long line of top class Australian “leggies” also including Bill “Tiger” O‘Reilly, Richie Benaud and Stuart MacGill, the English have often been accused of lacking the patience to develop the skill. .Borthwick’s return of 4-82 from his leg spin in a losing cause at the SCG in 2014 was decent enough but he never played another test, while Adil Rashid has since ended up on the test scrapheap after 10 matches, all abroad. .Crane’s development may mark a sea change to this attitude and, while still not a regular for his county Hampshire, he has already played two T20 internationals. .He linked up with MacGill when he came over to Australia in 2016-17 to play for Sydney’s Gordon club and three seven-wicket hauls earned him a New South Wales call-up, the first for a foreigner since Imran Khan in 1984-85. .He took 5-116 in his only Sheffield Shield game against South Australia, a match played at the SCG where he will make his debut on Thursday after once again working with MacGill. .Leg-spinners have to be aggressive and confident and it has been Crane’s attitude that has most impressed his captain. .“He showed in the T20 matches that he’s right up for international cricket and he’s not someone who’s going to back down,” Root said on Wednesday. .“On this surface, he’s going to be a really good option. It looks like it’s going to give a bit of turn throughout.” (Editing by Amlan Chakraborty)', 'output': "[['Mason Crane', 'PERSON', 'Introduce', 'test cricket', 'ORG/GOV'], ['Mason Crane', 'PERSON', 'Operate_In', 'England team', 'ORG'], ['Mason Crane', 'PERSON', 'Elevation', 'debut', 'EVENT'], ['England team', 'ORG', 'Plot', 'win', 'EVENT'], ['Leg-spinner', 'CONCEPT', 'Produce', 'spectacular results', 'CONCEPT'], ['Leg-spinner', 'CONCEPT', 'Control', 'difficult', 'CONCEPT'], ['Eric Hollies', 'PERSON', 'Bowl', 'googly', 'CONCEPT'], ['Don Bradman', 'PERSON', 'Get out', 'googly', 'CONCEPT'], ['Shane Warne', 'PERSON', 'Dismiss', 'Mike Gatting', 'PERSON'], ['Shane Warne', 'PERSON', 'Take', '1-150', 'ECON_INDICATOR'], ['Australia', 'GPE', 'Have', 'top class leg-spinners', 'CONCEPT'], ['England', 'GPE', 'Lack', 'patience', 'CONCEPT'], ['Scott Borthwick', 'PERSON', 'Take', '4-82', 'ECON_INDICATOR'], ['Adil Rashid', 'PERSON', 'End up', 'test scrapheap', 'CONCEPT'], ['Mason Crane', 'PERSON', 'Link up', 'Stuart MacGill', 'PERSON'], ['Mason Crane', 'PERSON', 'Take', '5-116', 'ECON_INDICATOR'], ['Mason Crane', 'PERSON', 'Work', 'Stuart MacGill', 'PERSON'], ['Leg-spinners', 'CONCEPT', 'Be', 'aggressive', 'CONCEPT'], ['Mason Crane', 'PERSON', 'Impress', 'Joe Root', 'PERSON'], ['Mason Crane', 'PERSON', 'Be', 'good option', 'CONCEPT'], ['Surface', 'CONCEPT', 'Give', 'turn', 'CONCEPT']]", 'category': 'closed_qa'}

The survival of the cub or cubs will not be fully confirmed until March, when bears emerge after winter. .The polar bear breeding season began in March last year, during which time Victoria mated with Arktos, one of the park’s two males. .“While we are absolutely thrilled, we are not celebrating prematurely as polar bear cubs have a high mortality rate in the first weeks of life due to their undeveloped immune system and the mother’s exaggerated need for privacy, with any disturbance risking the cub being killed or abandoned,” Richardson said. .Polar bears are born about 30 cm long and weigh roughly the same as a guinea pig. They emerge blind and do not open their eyes until they are about a month old, depending entirely on their mother’s milk.

A pharmacy employee dumps pills into a pill counting machine as she fills a prescription while working at a pharmacy in New York December 23, 2009. REUTERS/Lucas Jackson .Soaring U.S. prices for both branded and generic drugs have sparked public outrage and government investigations over the past few years. .“Drug price increases are somewhat more constrained in 2017 and 2018 than they have been previously,” Cowen and Co analyst Eric Schmidt said. .Allergan Inc ( AGN.N ) raised prices on 18 different drugs, including dry eye treatment Restasis and irritable bowel syndrome drug Linzess, by 9.5 percent, according to a research note released by Jefferies on Tuesday. .Jefferies cited data collected by Medi-Span Price Rx and refers to list price increases, before potentially significant discounts and rebates that drugmakers provide to win preferred coverage by insurers. Medi-Span did not respond to requests to confirm the data. .Allergan’s chief executive, Brent Saunders, in late 2016 pledged to keep price increases below 10 percent as part of what he called the company’s “Social Contract with Patients.” .Allergan spokesman Mark Marmur said the increases will be the only ones taken on those brands in 2018, adding that discounts to various payers should bring the actual increases to consumers down to the low single digits. .Other drugmakers raising prices include Amgen Inc ( AMGN.O ), Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Inc ( TEVA.TA ) ( TEVA.N ) and Horizon Pharma ( HZNP.O ), according to Jefferies and Cowen. Amgen raised the price on its blockbuster rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis drug Enbrel by 9.7 percent and Teva increased prices on its ProAir HFA and ProAir RespiClick asthma inhalers by 6 and 3 percent, respectively. .Drug price increases are coming under more scrutiny from states. California Governor Jerry Brown in October signed legislation requiring drug manufacturers to give 60-day notice if prices are raised more than 16 percent over a two-year period. .Shares of Allergan rose 4.1 percent on Tuesday, while Teva and Horizon Pharma shares were up 0.8 percent and 2.9 percent, respectively.

REUTERS/Aly Song The yearly average concentrations of particulate matter with a length of 2.5 microns or less, known as PM2.5 and which damage the lungs when inhaled, dropped by 35.6 percent in 2017 from 2012 to 58 micrograms per cubic metre, the Beijing Municipal Environmental Protection Bureau said..The figures were in line with Reuters estimates made last week..The Chinese capital was ordered to cut PM2.5 concentrations to less than 60 micrograms as part of a 2013 action plan designed to head off public anger about rising pollution..The city has since closed nearly 2,000 factories in the cement, foundry and furniture-making sectors, shut down coal-fired power plants and eliminated over 2 million high-emission vehicles over the past five years..Beijing, along with 27 other northern Chinese cities, is part of a government campaign that started in October to ensure the 2017 targets were met..As the region prepared to switch on residential winter heating systems, it started phasing out coal-fired boilers and switching to gas- or electric-powered equipment. It has also shut or curbed production at heavy industrial plants to limit smog build-ups..But the city’s environment agency acknowledged that drier and windier weather conditions played a role in meeting air quality targets for the year, especially in the fourth quarter..The government blamed bad weather for the near-record levels of smog last January and February, which saw PM2.5 readings spike by 26.7 percent in the key Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region in the first quarter of 2017..The province of Hebei, which surrounds Beijing and is a major source of smog drifting over the capital, also saw PM2.5 concentrations decline 7.1 percent from a year ago to 65 micrograms in 2017, the province’s environmental protection bureau said on Tuesday..But the region is still some distance away from meeting its official PM2.5 standard of 35 micrograms. The World Health Organization recommends levels of no more than 10 micrograms..“Current air pollutant levels remain a lot higher than the national air quality standard, indicating the improvement in air quality will still be a long-term process,” Beijing’s environment agency said..Reporting by Muyu Xu in Beijing and David Stanway in Shanghai.

FILE PHOTO - Soccer Football - Premier League - West Bromwich Albion vs Arsenal - The Hawthorns, West Bromwich, Britain - December 31, 2017 Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger reacts Action Images via Reuters/Jason Cairnduff .Forward Alexis Sanchez and midfielders Mesut Ozil and Jack Wilshere will be out of contract in June and while the England international is keen to stay at Arsenal, both Sanchez and Ozil look unlikely to sign new deals to stay at the Emirates. .“We are open in any position for the exceptional player who can give us a plus,” Wenger told a news conference on Tuesday. .”It depends a little bit on the injuries as well and, on the other hand, I must say it depends on who will manage to extend the contracts of the players who are on the end of their contracts in June. .“We will have to take the consequences of these decisions and respond to them.” .Sanchez and Ozil have been vital to Arsenal’s success in recent years but could leave in the ongoing window to avoid becoming free agents later in the year. .Media reports have linked the Chilean forward with a move to league leaders Manchester City while several clubs are linked with the German playmaker, including Manchester United and La Liga side Barcelona. .Wenger believes that even if the duo leave this month, Arsenal have the resources to compensate with quality signings of their own as they have done in the past. .“We have not lost anybody yet and, secondly, we will respond to that by bringing in players of top quality. We have not been contacted by anybody (about Sanchez or Ozil),” Wenger added. .“This club has lost many, many big players and has always responded well. Massive players have left this club and the club will always be in a strong position (afterwards). You want to keep your best players, yes.” .Defenders Sead Kolasinac and Nacho Monreal are out of Wednesday’s league game against champions Chelsea with ankle problems while Ozil and Laurent Koscielny are doubtful due to a knee and Achilles injury, respectively. .Chelsea drew with Arsenal in September’s league match at Stamford Bridge and are currently seven points ahead of the fifth-placed north London club.

FILE PHOTO: Alpine Skier Mikaela Shiffrin poses for a portrait at the U.S. Olympic Committee Media Summit in Park City Utah, U.S. September 25, 2017. REUTERS/Mike Blake/File photo .The 22-year-old Alpine ski racer heads to her second Olympic Games oozing with confidence after notching 37 World Cup wins, including the first ever in downhill late last year which stunned the skiing world. .Her torrid pace at World Cup events puts her on track to top Swedish legend Ingemar Stenmark’s all-time record of 86 wins. .But the slalom specialist will soon be ready to shift her focus from racking up World Cup wins to claiming medals on the sport’s biggest stage. .In a statement that should strike fear into the hearts of her competitors, she told Reuters that she was a better skiier now than she was when the then 18-year-old from Colorado won gold in slalom in Sochi, becoming the youngest women’s slalom champion in Olympic history. .“Being four years older I feel like I have more experience and knowledge under my belt,” she said. .“But especially since I have improved my skiing a lot since Sochi and I have had more success in events other than slalom, I feel like I‘m going into Pyeongchang with the unique opportunity to be a multiple event medal threat, which is super cool.” .Despite her success in downhill, where she earned her maiden World Cup victory in the discipline at Canada’s Lake Louise in early December, she is resisting the urge to stretch herself too thin in South Korea.

{'input': 'January 2, 2018 / 7:51 PM / Updated 29 minutes ago Passenger rights group takes legal action that could block Niki sale to IAG Reuters Staff 3 Min Read .FRANKFURT, Jan 2 (Reuters) - A group representing airline passengers has taken legal action to shift insolvency proceedings for budget airline Niki to Austria from Germany, in a move that could endanger the sale of the Air Berlin unit to Britain’s IAG. .Fairplane, seeking to recover more than 1 million euros ($1.2 million) it says Niki owes to passengers, filed separate legal cases on Tuesday to block insolvency proceedings in Berlin and to open them instead in Austria. .Although the sum sought is relatively small, a spokesman for Air Berlin liquidator Lucas Floether said the complaint could derail the sale of Niki to IAG’s low-cost Vueling operation that was agreed last week. .“If the complaint before the Charlottenburg Court (in Berlin) succeeds, the sale of Niki to IAG would be greatly endangered,” the spokesman said. A ruling by the court on the case was due this week. .British Airways’ owner IAG said last Friday it would buy Niki for 20 million euros ($24 million) and provide up to 16.5 million euros in additional liquidity to the company. .The sale to IAG, which had been in exclusive talks to acquire the airline, appeared to mark the final chapter in the demise of Air Berlin, the former No.2 German air carrier that earlier owned Niki. .Fairplane argues however that Niki, which is registered in as a company in Austria, had been profitable but had lost access to bridge financing when insolvency proceedings were opened in Germany in December, grounding planes and stranding passengers. .Spokesman Ronald Schmid said that dragging Niki into the German insolvency process was wrong, and that passengers stood a better chance of getting their money back in the Austrian courts. .“We want to ensure that the insolvency is carried out in Austria - where it belongs - so that there are no conflicts of interest,” Schmid told Reuters. .An IAG spokesman could not immediately be reached for comment. .In appointing Floether to liquidate Air Berlin in December, a German insolvency judge was of the opinion that, although Niki was registered as a company in Austria, its centre of main interest was in fact in Germany.

As recently as 2005, there were 1,015 deaths aboard commercial passenger flights worldwide, the Aviation Safety Network said. .For more on air travel, see Fortune’s video: .The United States last recorded a fatal airline passenger jet crash in February 2009, when Colgan Air Flight 3407 crashed short of the runway in Clarence Center, New York, killing 49 onboard and one person on the ground. .In 2016, 412 people were killed in the United States in aviation accidents – nearly all in general aviation accidents and none on commercial passenger airlines. .The last fatal passenger jet airliner accident worldwide took place in November 2016 near Medellin, Colombia and the last commercial passenger aircraft crash to kill more than 100 people occurred in October 2015 in Egypt.

It is also rewarding to see our progress reflected in our recent stock price. Over $126 million of cannabis-related products have been sold in Nevada since adult use went into effect on July 1, 2017. People dont realize that Nevada had more sales than Colorado experienced in their first four months of adult-use cannabis. We anticipate a continued significant increase in demand for cannabis lab testing services in 2018. In addition, with recreational cannabis now legal in California, we continue to work with our previously announced joint venture partner to launch an independent testing lab in California during 2018 as we seek to replicate our successful Nevada operations in other legal jurisdictions..Adjusted EBITDA.We define Adjusted EBITDA as net earnings (loss) before (i) other income (expense), (ii) interest income, (iii) interest expense, (iv) bad debts, (v) depreciation and amortization, (vi) impairment of securities available-for-sale costs, (vii) non-cash expenses relating to share based payments recognized under ASC Topic 718, (viii) gain on early extinguishment of debt, and (ix) equity in losses of unconsolidated entity. We believe the use of this non-GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors regarding our current financial performance; however, Adjusted EBITDA does not represent, and should not be considered an alternative to GAAP measurements. Specifically, we believe Adjusted EBITDA results provide useful information to both management and investors by excluding certain income and expenses that our management believes are not indicative of our core operating results, we believe that non-GAAP financial measures have limitations and do not reflect all of the amounts associated with our results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP and that Adjusted EBITDA should only be used to evaluate our results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP financial measures.

On January 4, 2016, Capitala Finance announced that Capitala Investment Advisors agreed to voluntarily waive its quarterly incentive fee. Throughout the class period, Capitala Finance emphasized in its Securities and Exchange Commission filings that the companys success depends on the ability of Capitala Investment Advisors to attract and retain qualified personnel in a competitive environment.

The next day, Capitala Finance revealed that Capitala Investment Advisors had been losing professional talent in underwriting and portfolio management due to the waiving of its incentive fee. Capitala Finance further acknowledged that the rising number of nonaccrual investments was connected to the loss in talent, causing the company’s stock to fall nearly 30% over the next three trading days to close at $8.99 per share on August 10, 2017.

The survival of the cub or cubs will not be fully confirmed until March, when bears emerge after winter..The polar bear breeding season began in March last year, during which time Victoria mated with Arktos, one of the park’s two males..“While we are absolutely thrilled, we are not celebrating prematurely as polar bear cubs have a high mortality rate in the first weeks of life due to their undeveloped immune system and the mother’s exaggerated need for privacy, with any disturbance risking the cub being killed or abandoned,” Richardson said..Polar bears are born about 30 cm long and weigh roughly the same as a guinea pig.

A week ago Egypt hanged 15 men accused of deadly attacks in the Sinai peninsula, believed to be the largest number of people executed in a single day since President Abdel Fateh al-Sisi took power. .The latest executions were carried out in the Borg al-Arab prison, west of the coastal city of Alexandria, after the military appeals court rejected appeals by the defendants, the sources said. .The four were hanged for their role in a bombing in the Nile Delta town of Kafr al-Sheikh that took place during violence that followed the ouster of President Mohamed Mursi of the Muslim Brotherhood. Sisi, then the military chief, removed Mursi in mid-2013 after mass protests against Mursi’s rule. .The court also sentenced three others in absentia to death, and jailed eight others, including Salah al-Feki, head of the Muslim Brotherhood’s administrative office in Kafr al-Sheikh. .Authorities banned the Brotherhood and declared it a terrorist organisation after Mursi was deposed, arresting thousands of its members and supporters. .Since then, Egypt has faced a growing insurgency from Islamic State fighters in the Sinai Peninsula. .(This story corrects date of attack to 2015 not 2014.)

{'input': 'LONDON Bitcoin was a hot topic at this year’s seasonal parties. Financially ignorant people asked what is going on. The most authoritative answers often came from those with little previous interest in investment. It is a familiar pattern..In financial bubbles, the end is likely near when amateurs become experts. As speculator Bernard Baruch reminisced about the late 1920s: “An old beggar who regularly patrolled the street in front of my office now gave me tips and, I suppose, spent the money I and others gave him in the market.”.In one important way, though, this time is different. While the stock market was undoubtedly overvalued before the 1929 crash, almost all the companies were quite profitable. In contrast, there is little of substance supporting electronic tokens such as bitcoin..All right, there is a story. In some future time, government-backed currencies will be discredited, but computer networks will still be standing strong. Then people who are desperate for sound money will turn to the software elixir of monetary security, the self-regulating blockchain. Bitcoin and other tokens based on this wondrous technology will be immensely valuable, so much so that no current price is too high..After three decades of global disinflation with almost no consumer losses on bank deposits, that story is nonsensical. Even counting the appeal of anonymous crypto-transactions to criminals, this may well be the weakest justification for an investment craze since the Albanian bubble of 1996..In that year the Balkan state was swept up in a mania for “investment funds”. These were actually classic Ponzi schemes. They promised extravagant returns of up to 30 percent a month, and could keep going as long as they collected enough new cash to repay the few who wanted to sell out..The growth was dramatic. Over a few months, the funds sucked in the equivalent of almost half of the nation’s gross domestic product, according to an International Monetary Fund study published in 2000. People sold houses and slaughtered their herds to raise funds to invest..It all unravelled in early 1997, creating a popular uproar. The government fell, armouries were looted and fighting broke out. The IMF estimates that 2,000 people died. A new government restored civil and monetary order, but Albania’s GDP fell 11 percent in 1997, and did not recover fully for five years. The compound annual GDP growth rate for the previous five years did not return to the pre-mania level of 5 percent until 2001..Albanian fund buyers were certainly greedy and foolish. Still, after 40 years of isolationist Communist rule, residents could be forgiven for not understanding how financial markets work. Besides, the post-Communist government did nothing to dispel popular illusions during those manic months..Buyers of bitcoin and its peers have more to be ashamed of. They are certainly not desperately poor, and any ignorance is wilful. The key drawback of crypto-currencies – that they lack any legal function – is glaringly obvious. With a little more digging, potential buyers could also see this market is like a Ponzi promoter’s dream. Almost nobody sells, and new buyers do not care about the price..Bitcoin’s rise in 2017 – its value increased by the equivalent of 24 percent a month – has overpowered such concerns. Like the Albanians before them, crypto-currency speculators have responded to signals of future wealth with a blind, instinctual frenzy. Technically they remain rational creatures, but greed has overcome their judgement..There are two differences between Albania then and crypto-world now. First, the current frenzy has stimulated the creation of a complex trading infrastructure with a speed and sophistication that the hucksters of Tirana could hardly have imagined. Newly minted financial experts can dabble in futures contracts, while drawing on dedicated websites, technical analysts and a burgeoning public relations industry..Second and more happily, the crypto-collapse is set to be much less damaging. The current market capitalisation of the leading 30 pretend monies was more than $640 billion on Jan. 3, according to coinmarketcap.com. That is a lot to pay for almost nothing, but it is well below 1 percent of global GDP..The speed of the recent ascent should ensure that the amount of borrowing secured by the value of these essentially valueless assets is only a tiny fraction of their nominal worth. When financial prices collapse, bad loans tend to cause most of the damage. The bonfire of the cryptos should therefore hardly cause an economic ripple – as long as it comes fairly soon..Still – like the Albanian craze of 1996 – this episode provides further evidence of the failures of market-based finance.

{'input': 'January 3, 2018 / 5:11 PM / Updated 18 minutes ago Spotify makes confidential filing for U.S. IPO: source Greg Roumeliotis , Liana B. Baker 3 Min Read .NEW YORK/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Music streaming service Spotify has filed confidentially with U.S. regulators for an initial public offering and is targeting a direct listing in the first half of 2018 that would allow some longtime investors to cash out, a source familiar with the matter said on Wednesday. Earphones are seen on a tablet screen with a Spotify logo on it, in Zenica, Bosnia and Herzegovina, February 20, 2014. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/File Photo .If Spotify, which was valued at as much as $19 billion last year, goes ahead with its plans, it would be the first major company to carry out a direct listing, an unconventional way to pursue an IPO without raising new capital. .A direct listing mainly eliminates the need for a Wall Street bank or broker to underwrite an IPO along with many associated fees and could change the way companies approach selling shares to the public. .The confidential filing was initially reported by news outlet Axios. .The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission now allows all companies, regardless of revenue, to file a draft IPO registration statement confidentially before they unveil their financials. .Spotify is the biggest global music streaming company and counts Apple Inc ( AAPL.O ) and Amazon.com Inc ( AMZN.O ) as its main rivals. Reuters had previously reported Spotify was aiming to file for an IPO in late 2017 and list with the New York Stock Exchange early this year. .Spotify declined to comment. .Spotify was sued by Wixen Music Publishing Inc last week for allegedly using thousands of songs without a license and compensation to the music publisher. Wixen is seeking damages worth at least $1.6 billion. .Spotify intends to proceed with a U.S. direct listing in the first half of 2018 despite the lawsuit, according to a source familiar with the matter. Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Allen & Co are helping arrange the listing, the source added. .The lawsuit is unlikely to have a major impact on Spotify’s IPO, said Luke DeMarte, a copyright lawyer at Michael Best & Friedrich not involved. DeMarte said he expects Wixen to settle its case for far less than the damages it is seeking and that it is unlikely any of the publisher lawsuits go to trial. .“It is not in Wixen’s interests or its constituents’ interests to stop Spotify or really inflict harm on them because it is the main game in town for streaming,” DeMarte said. .The company said in June it had more than 140 million active users while listing more than 30 million songs. Spotify last reported more than 60 million paid users, twice that of Apple Music, its closest rival. Reporting by Greg Roumeliotis in New York and Liana B.

BP logo is seen at a fuel station of British oil company BP in St. Petersburg, October 18, 2012. REUTERS/Alexander Demianchuk/Files .BP’s rival Royal Dutch Shell ( RDSa.L ) said last week it would incur a one-off charge of $2-$2.5 billion for the U.S. tax changes. .Like BP, Shell and many other international companies said they expected a long-term positive impact to U.S. earnings from the massive $1.5 trillion tax overhaul that U.S. President Donald Trump signed into law last month. It cuts the corporate rate from 35 percent to 21 percent and temporarily reduces the tax burden for most individuals as well. .But BP said that in the short term, lower tax rates will affect its deferred tax assets and liabilities, resulting in a one-off, non-cash charge of $1.5 billion to its 2017 fourth quarter results which are due to be announced on Feb. 8. .“The ultimate impact of the change in the U.S. corporate income tax rate is subject to a number of complex provisions in the legislation which BP is reviewing,” BP said in a statement. .The British company’s shares closed down about 1 percent on Tuesday. .The adjustment will not affect BP’s cash flow in the fourth quarter. .Exxon Mobil Corp ( XOM.N ), the world’s largest publicly traded oil producer, declined to comment on how the U.S. tax changes would financially affect it. .Chevron Corp ( CVX.N ) said it was studying the changes but still plans to invest $8 billion in the United States this year. .Deferred tax assets refer in some cases to a company overpaying taxes in advance and then getting them back in the form of tax relief. .BP has large operations in oil and gas production in the Gulf of Mexico and onshore shale operations as well as refineries that can process up to 746,000 barrels per day of crude oil, according to its website. .On Dec. 22, Trump signed the tax overhaul into law, cutting tax rates for businesses and offering some temporary cuts for some individuals and families.

A building had been reduced to rubble, with only a few sections of wall left standing. .Nobody claimed responsibility for the attack, but it bears the hallmarks of Boko Haram, a jihadist group which frequently uses suicide bombers, often women and girls, to attack crowded public spaces such as mosques and markets. .Despite repeated government and military assertions that the insurgency has been defeated, Boko Haram continues to carry out lethal attacks on the military and civilians. .Last week four civilians were killed in an attack by suspected Boko Haram militants on Maiduguri, the Nigerian city at the centre of the conflict with the Islamists. .In November a suicide bomber killed at least 50 people in an attack on a mosque, in one of the deadliest bombings of recent years.

{'input': '- US$7.0 million purchase price funded from existing cash -.- Immediately accretive acquisition -.MISSISSAUGA, ON, Jan. 2, 2018 /PRNewswire/ - Nuvo Pharmaceuticals Inc. (Nuvo or the Company) (TSX: NRI; OTCQX: NRIFF), a commercial healthcare company with a portfolio of commercial products and pharmaceutical manufacturing capabilities, today announced it has acquired the global, ex-U.S. (the Territory) rights to Resultz ® (50% isopropyl myristate, 50% cyclomethicone D5 topical solution lice and egg removal kit) from Piedmont Pharmaceuticals LLC (Piedmont). The transaction includes existing royalty streams in the Royalty Markets (as defined below) and all product and intellectual property (IP) rights in the Territory..Resultz is a commercial-stage, best-in-class, clinically proven, safe, non-pesticide, over-the-counter (OTC) treatment for head lice. This market-leading product is currently sold in several European markets, including France, Spain, Portugal, Belgium, Ireland and the United Kingdom, as well as Canada, Russia, Australia and Israel (collectively the Royalty Markets), through a network of existing license agreements and partners that will be assumed by Nuvo. Aggregate net sales of Resultz in the Royalty Markets, for the twelve months ending September 2017, were approximately US$16.0 million generating royalty payments of approximately US$1.5 million. Resultz is currently approved for sale under its European Conformity (CE) mark as a class 1 medical device, but not yet partnered or launched in all remaining E.U. territories, including the key markets of Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Scandinavia and Greece. The current head lice market in the remaining E.U. territories was valued at approximately US$150 million in 2016. Resultz has not been partnered or approved in most rest of world markets, including the Middle East and Africa, Latin America and Asia Pacific (outside of Japan and Australia). However, the European CE mark is recognized in many of these markets and may facilitate class 1 medical device registration procedures via local partners. With a global head lice prevalence of approximately 6%, the market opportunity for Resultz in all non-Royalty Markets is attractive and growing. This transaction is immediately accretive and provides Nuvo with an additional global product that, alongside existing manufacturing partners, can be produced at Nuvos Varennes, Québec manufacturing site..This is an exciting day for Nuvo, said Jesse Ledger, Nuvos President & CEO. The addition of the Resultz brand to our global product portfolio is an example of the disciplined transactions we are pursuing to make Nuvo a more diversified and profitable company. Resultz checks all of the boxes for an ideal new Nuvo product: it is approved, has commercialized-generating royalty revenue, broad global IP protection, provides significant opportunity for global geographic expansion and revenue growth and can be manufactured in our Varennes, Québec facility..Purchase Agreement Details.Under the terms of the agreement, Nuvo has paid US$7.0 million on close to Piedmont. The transaction also includes a single-digit royalty payable by Nuvo on net sales generated from non-Royalty Markets through 2023 and potential added future consideration in the form of payments for achieving certain aggregate annual net sales-based milestones..Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated acted as exclusive financial advisor to Piedmont Pharmaceuticals LLC in this transaction..About Resultz.Resultz is a pesticide-free pediculicide rinse which was originally developed by Piedmont that addresses the challenge of increasing pesticide resistance in lice and concerns about patient safety through exposure to pesticides. In as little as a 5-minute application (the shortest treatment time for head lice products), Resultz acts to disrupt the wax covering of the head louse resulting in their dehydration and death. Resultz lice and egg removal kit facilitates removal of lice, nymphs and nits with efficacy of up to 100%. If necessary, a second application approximately 7-10 days later will eliminate any remaining lice. The Resultz lice and egg removal kit and its unique physical mechanism of action allows Resultz to work even with pesticide resistant super lice. Resultz is indicated for treating both children and adults. It has an excellent safety profile and contains active ingredients commonly found in many cosmetic products. Resultz was first launched as a medical device in the United Kingdom and Ireland in 2005 and more than ten million patients have been treated globally to-date. Current global licensees include Reckitt Benckiser Group PLC, Aralez Pharmaceuticals Inc. and Lapidot Medical. Resultz is also pending registration in Japan, where the local license is held by Sato Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd. Resultz is protected by a robust portfolio of 40 issued patents globally..About Piedmont Pharmaceuticals LLC.Piedmont Pharmaceuticals is committed to continuing to grow the Resultz Brand globally. It is closely affiliated with Piedmont Animal Health LLC which at one time was a wholly owned subsidiary.

{'input': 'January 3, 2018 / 12:00 PM / Updated 36 minutes ago RPT-YOUR MONEY-New U.S. tax law could impact paychecks by February Reuters Staff .(Repeats story published Tuesday with no changes) .By Beth Pinsker .NEW YORK, Jan 2 (Reuters) - The first paychecks of 2018 will be dispatched soon, but it may be weeks or months before taxpayers and payroll processors know how the new U.S. tax laws will affect your take-home pay. .The Internal Revenue Service said it expected to issue guidance in January on how much in taxes employers should withhold based on the new tax rates. Employers and payroll services would then implement those changes starting in February. .You might not even notice when it happens because the effect on your paycheck could be relatively small, depending on your income and your tax situation. .“When the taxes are reduced by 1 to 3 percent, that’s not going to be a huge noticeable difference. It’s not going to be hundreds of dollars,” said Pete Isberg, vice president of government relations at ADP, the largest payroll processor in the United States, servicing the paychecks of one out of every six workers. .A difference of $1,000, for instance, would be less than $40 a pop for a worker paid biweekly. .Your paycheck is not actually a clear indicator of whether your overall taxes have gone up or down because of the new tax law. There may be other factors in your tax situation - such as owning a property or having multiple children - that could affect how much you owe Uncle Sam at the end of the year. .Be prepared for tax uncertainty until you do your taxes for 2018 a year or so from now. You cannot even estimate your taxes until tax professionals and do-it-yourself services like TurboTax update their software. And that cannot happen until the IRS releases the new withholding tables and issues more guidance on the specifics of other tax changes. .“We will be ready to help our customers. We just need more information,” said David Williams, executive director of the Intuit Tax and Financial Center. WAITING FOR W-4 FORMS .You may be tempted to get a jump on the IRS and change how much tax is taken out of your paycheck by adjusting your W-4 form, but that may be premature, warned Isberg. .The IRS said in its last note that it would be attempting to work with existing W-4 forms for now. .The standard federal W-4, which all employees fill out, is based on the notion of “allowances,” which you could adjust based on your personal situation. .In the past, a single person with three children and a home in a high-tax state like New York might have listed themselves as married and claim one allowance per person, plus a few extra because they were likely to itemize their deductions and owe less. A married person with a freelance spouse who owes quarterly taxes might have listed themselves as single to have enough taken out to cover both of them. .The goal of people adjusting their withholding was to come as close as possible to paying the correct amount of tax - rather than owing money at the end of the year or ending up with a giant refund. .But it will all be different math for 2018. .“For first few weeks of January stay put, and see what the IRS comes out with,” said Isberg, who also cautioned that employees should keep an eye on tax changes at the state level. .Above all, do not panic, said Farsheed Ferdowsi, president and CEO of Inova Payroll, which handles paychecks for more than 3,000 companies. .“When you have changes in taxes, it usually goes a lot smoother than most people know,” Ferdowsi said. “If the first (paycheck) is wrong, it catches up on the next one.” (Editing by Lauren Young and Lisa Shumaker)', 'output': "[['Internal Revenue Service', 'ORG/GOV', 'Impact', 'Paychecks', 'COMP'], ['Internal Revenue Service', 'ORG/GOV', 'Issue', 'Guidance', 'CONCEPT'], ['Employers', 'ORG', 'Implement', 'Changes', 'CONCEPT'], ['Paychecks', 'COMP', 'Operate_In', 'Take-home Pay', 'CONCEPT'], ['Employers', 'ORG', 'Withhold', 'Taxes', 'CONCEPT'], ['Taxpayers', 'PERSON', 'Affect', 'Take-home Pay', 'CONCEPT'], ['Payroll Processors', 'ORG', 'Affect', 'Take-home Pay', 'CONCEPT'], ['New U.S. Tax Laws', 'CONCEPT', 'Impact', 'Take-home Pay', 'CONCEPT'], ['Employers', 'ORG', 'Operate_In', 'February', 'TIME'], ['Employees', 'PERSON', 'Fill Out', 'W-4 Forms', 'CONCEPT'], ['IRS', 'ORG/GOV', 'Attempt', 'Work', 'CONCEPT'], ['Existing W-4 Forms', 'CONCEPT', 'Attempt', 'Work', 'CONCEPT'], ['Employees', 'PERSON', 'Adjust', 'Withholding', 'CONCEPT'], ['Employees', 'PERSON', 'Come', 'Close', 'CONCEPT'], ['Employees', 'PERSON', 'Pay', 'Correct Amount', 'CONCEPT'], ['Employees', 'PERSON', 'Owe', 'Money', 'CONCEPT'], ['Employees', 'PERSON', 'End Up', 'Giant Refund', 'CONCEPT'], ['Employees', 'PERSON', 'Adjust', 'W-4 Forms', 'CONCEPT'], ['IRS', 'ORG/GOV', 'Release', 'New Withholding Tables', 'CONCEPT'], ['Employees', 'PERSON', 'Update', 'Software', 'CONCEPT'], ['Tax Professionals', 'ORG', 'Update', 'Their Software', 'CONCEPT'], ['Do-it-yourself Services', 'ORG', 'Update', 'Their Software', 'CONCEPT'], ['Employees', 'PERSON', 'Prepare', 'Tax Uncertainty', 'CONCEPT'], ['Employees', 'PERSON', 'Do', 'Their Taxes', 'CONCEPT'], ['Employees', 'PERSON', 'Estimate', 'Their Taxes', 'CONCEPT'], ['Employees', 'PERSON', 'Keep', 'Eye', 'CONCEPT'], ['Tax Changes', 'CONCEPT', 'Keep', 'Eye', 'CONCEPT'], ['Employees', 'PERSON', 'Not Panic', 'CONCEPT'], ['Paychecks', 'COMP', 'Catch Up', 'CONCEPT'], ['Next One', 'TIME', 'Catch Up', 'CONCEPT'], ['Changes', 'CONCEPT', 'Go', 'Smoother', 'CONCEPT'], ['Most People', 'PERSON', 'Know', 'CONCEPT'], ['First Paycheck', 'COMP', 'Wrong', 'CONCEPT'], ['Next One', 'TIME', 'Catch Up', 'CONCEPT']]", 'category': 'closed_qa'}
{'input': 'North Korean leader Kim Jong Un reopened a key cross-border communication channel with South Korea for the first time in nearly two years Wednesday as the rivals explored the possibility of sitting down and talking after months of acrimony and fears of war..Even among the sudden signs of easing animosity, however, President Donald Trump threatened Kim with nuclear war..In his New Years address Monday, Kim said he was willing to send a delegation to next months Winter Olympics in South Korea . But he also said he has a nuclear button on his desk and that all U.S. territory is within striking distance of his nuclear weapons, comments Trump latched onto Tuesday when he boasted of a bigger and more powerful nuclear button than Kims..The two leaders exchanged crude insults last year, after the North received new U.N. sanctions over its sixth and most powerful nuclear test explosion and a series of intercontinental ballistic launches..The recent softening of contact between the rival Koreas may show a shared interest in improved ties, but theres no guarantee tensions will ease. There have been repeated attempts in recent years by the rivals to talk, but even when they do meet, the efforts often end in recriminations and stalemate..Getty Images In this handout image provided by the South Korean Unification Ministry, A South Korean government official checks the direct communications hotline to talk with the North Korean side at the border village of Panmunjom on January 3, 2018 in Panmunjom, South Korea. Outside critics say Kim may be trying to use better ties with South Korea as a way to weaken the alliance between Washington and Seoul as the North grapples with toughened international sanctions over its nuclear and missile programs..Kims latest announcement, which was read by a senior Pyongyang official on state TV, followed a South Korean offer on Tuesday of high-level talks with North Korea to find ways to cooperate on next months Winter Olympics in the South and discuss other inter-Korean issues..Ri Son Gwon, chairman of the state-run Committee for the Peaceful Reunification, cited Kim as welcoming South Koreas overture and ordering officials to reopen a communication channel at the border village of Panmunjom. Ri also Quote: d Kim as ordering officials to promptly take substantial measures with South Korea out of a sincere stand and honest attitude, according to the Norths state TV and news agency..South Korea quickly welcomed Kims decision and later confirmed that the two Koreas began preliminary contacts on the channel..Since taking office last May, South Koreas liberal President Moon Jae-in has pushed hard to improve ties and resume stalled cooperation projects with North Korea. Pyongyang had not responded to his outreach until Kims New Years address..Relations between the Koreas soured under Moons conservative predecessors, who responded to the Norths expanding nuclear program with hard-line measures. All major rapprochement projects were put on hold one by one, and the Panmunjom communication channel has been suspended since February 2016..Moon has pushed for more pressure and sanctions on North Korea, but he still favors dialogue as a way to resolve the nuclear standoff. The Trump administration says all options are on the table, including military measures against the North. Moon has repeatedly said he opposes any war on the Korean Peninsula..Some observers believe these differences in views may have led Kim to think he could drive a wedge between Seoul and Washington as a way to weaken their alliance and international sanctions..Talks could provide a temporary thaw in strained inter-Korean ties, but conservative critics worry that they may only earn the North time to perfect its nuclear weapons..After the Olympics, inter-Korean ties could become frosty again because the North has made it clear it has no intention of accepting international calls for nuclear disarmament and instead wants to bolster its weapons arsenal in the face of what it considers increasing U.S. threats, analysts say.', 'output': '[[\'Kim Jong Un\', \'PERSON\', \'Reopen\', \'key cross-border communication channel\', \'CONCEPT\'], [\'Kim Jong Un\', \'PERSON\', \'Explore\', \'sitting down and talking\', \'CONCEPT\'], [\'Donald Trump\', \'PERSON\', \'Threaten\', \'Kim\', \'PERSON\'], [\'Kim Jong Un\', \'PERSON\', \'Say\', \'willing to send a delegation\', \'CONCEPT\'], [\'Kim Jong Un\', \'PERSON\', \'Say\', \'nuclear button on his desk\', \'CONCEPT\'], [\'Kim Jong Un\', \'PERSON\', \'Say\', \'all U.S. territory is within striking distance\', \'CONCEPT\'], [\'Donald Trump\', \'PERSON\', \'Boast\', \'bigger and more powerful "nuclear button"\', \'CONCEPT\'], [\'Kim Jong Un\', \'PERSON\', \'Exchange\', \'crude insults\', \'CONCEPT\'], [\'North Korea\', \'GPE\', \'Receive\', \'new U.N. sanctions\', \'CONCEPT\'], [\'North Korea\', \'GPE\', \'Test\', \'sixth and most powerful nuclear\', \'CONCEPT\'], [\'North Korea\', \'GPE\', \'Launch\', \'intercontinental ballistic\', \'CONCEPT\'], [\'Rivals\', \'CONCEPT\', \'Attempt\', \'recently to talk\', \'CONCEPT\'], [\'Kim Jong Un\', \'PERSON\', \'Order\', \'officials to reopen\', \'CONCEPT\'], [\'Kim Jong Un\', \'PERSON\', \'Order\', \'substantial measures\', \'CONCEPT\'], [\'South Korea\', \'GPE\', \'Welcome\', \'Kim’s decision\', \'CONCEPT\'], [\'South Korea\', \'GPE\', \'Confirm\', \'preliminary contacts\', \'CONCEPT\'], [\'Moon Jae-in\', \'PERSON\', \'Push\', \'improve ties\', \'CONCEPT\'], [\'Moon Jae-in\', \'PERSON\', \'Push\', \'resume stalled cooperation projects\', \'CONCEPT\'], [\'North Korea\', \'GPE\', \'Not respond\', \'Moon’s outreach\', \'CONCEPT\'], [\'Relations\', \'CONCEPT\', \'Sour\', \'under Moon’s predecessors\', \'CONCEPT\'], [\'Panmunjom communication channel\', \'CONCEPT\', \'Suspended\', \'since February 2016\', \'TIME\'], [\'Moon Jae-in\', \'PERSON\', \'Favor\', \'dialogue\', \'CONCEPT\'], [\'Trump administration\', \'ORG\', \'Say\', \'all options are on the table\', \'CONCEPT\'], [\'Moon Jae-in\', \'PERSON\', \'Oppose\', \'any war\', \'CONCEPT\'], [\'Some observers\', \'CONCEPT\', \'Believe\', \'Kim may drive a wedge\', \'CONCEPT\'], [\'Talks\', \'CONCEPT\', \'Provide\', \'temporary thaw\', \'CONCEPT\'], [\'Conservative critics\', \'CONCEPT\', \'Worry\', \'may only earn the North time\', \'CONCEPT\'], [\'After the Olympics\', \'TIME\', \'Inter-Korean ties\', \'Could become frosty again\', \'CONCEPT\']]', 'category': 'closed_qa'}

FILE PHOTO: A market maker works on the trading floor at IG Index in London, Britain January 14, 2016. REUTERS/Stefan Wermuth/File Photo .The new rules are already a year late due to their complexity and regulators have had to issue eleventh-hour guidance to banks and financial firms to avoid trading freezes as well as calming nerves of those not yet fully compliant. .“For the markets facing processes, there will be a very intensive through-the-night activity,” said David Lawton, a managing director at consultants Alvarez & Marsal and former senior markets regulator at Britain’s Financial Conduct Authority. .The new regime shines a spotlight on the innards of stock, bond, commodity and derivatives markets by forcing banks, asset managers and traders to report detailed information on trillions of euros in transactions. .Banks and trading firms have spent millions of euros getting ready for the big day. A report from Expand, part of the BostonConsulting Group and IHS Markit, has estimated that top global banks and asset managers will have spent $2.1 billion (£1.55 billion) last year to comply with the rules. .Lawton expects the new regime to trigger consolidation as the competition it aims to promote proves too much for some. .Credit rating agency Standard & Poor’s said there would likely be more losers than winners from the profound changes being ushered in. .The aim is increase transparency and bolster investor protection to avoid some of the problems of the 2007-2009 financial crisis. .Stock, bond, derivatives, commodity and other trades must all be reported to a repository, giving regulators a trove of data to track trades and try to spot bubbles early after failing to see the last crisis coming. .When the rules go live on Wednesday, fund managers and others must for the first time fill in a transaction report with up to 65 bits of data within 15 minutes of a trade - or risk being fined. .The rules, known as MiFID II or Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II, represent a revamp of the2007 MiFID law to increase transparency and investor protection and broaden its scope to take in more financial products. .MiFID II will be a journey and not a one off event inJanuary, is how one national regulator responded to questions about how trading will unfold on January 3. LIQUIDITY WATCH .The European Securities and Markets Authority, which is overseeing the roll out, published a flurry of statements just before Christmas to tackle some remaining road bumps. .“ESMA, in close cooperation with the national regulatory authorities across the EU, has carried out a broad range of work ... to ensure that the framework is in place to ensure a smooth transition from MiFID I to MiFID II,” ESMA Chairman Steven Maijoor told Reuters. So far, only 11 of the EU’s 28 member states have written MiFID II fully into national law. But ESMA has said that all firms can carry on even if their home state has not completed the legislative process. .Germany, France and Britain, home to the EU’s top financial centres, are among the 11 EU states whose national laws are up to speed and big banks are likely to be ready. .Royal Bank of Scotland’s ( RBS.L ) NatWest Markets has conducted a “soft launch”. From January 2 to January 4, some of its staff will work through the night. “Day One will hopefully go smoothly and we are as ready as we can be,” Giovanni Mazzocchi, head of macro distribution inEurope for Barclays ( BARC.L ), said. .“There are a few overnighters going on to make sure everything will work on the day.” .Industry officials predict light trading volumes initially rather than paralysis. .A European bond strategist said trading glitches could become a “self-fulfilling prophecy” as people feel their way under the new rules. .“Everyone says I want to be careful for that first month of the year, and if everyone does that, we won’t have liquidity,” the strategist said. DISRUPTIVE .ESMA will make use of the new data to set curbs on trading positions in commodities and cap off-exchange trading of shares or so-called “dark pools.” .MiFID II also gives investors more information about which trading platforms offer the best deals, and asset managers will have to show investors who is paying for stock research. .A fundamental aim of the original MiFID was to increase competition in share trading by allowing new platforms to take on centuries-old rivals like the London Stock Exchange ( LSE.L ). .Upstarts like Chi-X went on to become among the biggest pan-European share trading platforms and regulators want MiFID II to bring “disruption” to trading in other assets, forcing companies to become more agile. .“There will be interesting times over the next few years with new players entering the market and both clients and banks making full use of the new available data to shape their activities in the market,” Mazzocchi said. .Christian Voigt, senior regulatory adviser at Fidessa, a provider of trading software, said MiFID II did not represent a revolution in share trading, but would have a big impact on bonds, commodities and derivatives, where electronic trading will increase. .“For fixed income and off-exchange derivatives, the whole mindset needs to change as a lot of trades are still done over the phone,” Voigt said. .(This version of the story corrects “this year” to “last year” in the fifth paragraph) Additional reporting by Fanny Potkin, editing by Jane Merriman', 'output': "[['Bankers', 'PERSON', 'Work_Through_The_Night', 'MiFID', 'EVENT'], ['MiFID', 'EVENT', 'Aim', 'Increase_Transparency', 'CONCEPT'], ['MiFID', 'EVENT', 'Bolster', 'Investor_Protection', 'CONCEPT'], ['MiFID', 'EVENT', 'Broadens', 'Scope', 'SECTOR'], ['Banks', 'ORG', 'Spend', 'Millions_of_Euros', 'ECON_INDICATOR', 'Get_Ready', 'MiFID', 'EVENT'], ['Top_Global_Banks_and_Asset_Managers', 'ORG', 'Spend', '$2.1_Billion', 'ECON_INDICATOR', 'Last_Year', 'To_Comply', 'MiFID', 'EVENT'], ['MiFID', 'EVENT', 'Trigger', 'Consolidation', 'SECTOR'], ['Standard_&_Poor’s', 'ORG', 'Said', 'More_Losers_Than_Winners', 'CONCEPT', 'From_Profound_Changes', 'MiFID', 'EVENT'], ['MiFID', 'EVENT', 'Increase', 'Transparency', 'CONCEPT'], ['MiFID', 'EVENT', 'Stock', 'Bond', 'Derivatives', 'Commodity_and_Other_Trades', 'Report', 'Repository', 'ORG'], ['Fund_Managers', 'ORG', 'Fill_In', 'Transaction_Report', 'PRODUCT', 'Within_15_Minutes', 'Trade', 'MiFID', 'EVENT'], ['MiFID', 'EVENT', 'Revamp', '2007_MiFID_Law', 'EVENT'], ['European_Securities_and_Markets_Authority', 'ORG/REG', 'Oversee', 'Roll_Out', 'MiFID', 'EVENT'], ['ESMA', 'ORG/REG', 'Ensure', 'Smooth_Transition', 'MiFID_I_to_MiFID_II', 'EVENT'], ['MiFID_II', 'EVENT', 'January_3', 'DATE'], ['ESMA', 'ORG/REG', 'Make_Use', 'New_Data', 'FIN_INSTRUMENT', 'Set_Caps', 'Trading_Positions', 'CONCEPT'], ['MiFID_II', 'EVENT', 'Give', 'Investors_More_Information', 'CONCEPT'], ['Asset_Managers', 'ORG', 'Show', 'Investors', 'Who_Is_Paying', 'Stock_Research', 'CONCEPT'], ['Original_MiFID', 'EVENT', 'Aim', 'Increase_Competition', 'SECTOR'], ['MiFID_II', 'EVENT', 'Bring', 'Disruption', 'SECTOR'], ['New_Players', 'ORG', 'Enter', 'Market', 'SECTOR'], ['Banks', 'ORG', 'Make_Full_Use', 'New_Available_Data', 'FIN_INSTRUMENT', 'Shape', 'Activities', 'CONCEPT'], ['Fixed_Income_and_Off_Exchange_Derivatives', 'SECTOR', 'Whole_Mindset', 'Change', 'CONCEPT'], ['Trades', 'VERB', 'Still_Done', 'Over_Phone', 'CONCEPT']]", 'category': 'closed_qa'}

{'input': 'January 2, 2018 / 5:14 PM / Updated 19 minutes ago Exclusive - Liberian President-elect Weah tempers expectations, plans agriculture push Edward McAllister 4 Min Read .MONROVIA (Reuters) - Liberian President-elect George Weah on Tuesday set modest goals for his six-year term, calling for Liberia to start exporting crops and repairing decrepit infrastructure, in his first interview since winning election last week. President-elect George Weah of the Coalition for Democratic Change (CDC) speaks during an interview with REUTERS at his residence in Monrovia, Liberia, January 2, 2018. REUTERS/Thierry Gouegnon .Weah rode a wave of youth support to capture more than 60 percent of the vote in last Tuesday’s run-off, but he will need to manage expectations as he attempts to revive one of Africa’s worst-performing economies. .Later this month, he will replace President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, Africa’s first elected female head of state and a Nobel Peace Prize laureate, in Liberia’s first democratic transfer of power since 1944. .Seated outside his unfinished new house on a quiet dirt backstreet near the capital Monrovia, where a concrete sign announces, “Friends of Weah say welcome”, the 51-year-old ex-soccer star began to tentatively fill in some of the gaps in his vague campaign promises. .“I want for us to be self-sustained so we can export,” he said, appearing at ease in a dark blue dress shirt and gold watch. “The government has a responsibility to have agricultural programmes so people are able to grow their own food.” .“Ghana exports, our neighbouring countries export - we have the capacity to export,” he continued. “They export and we can do the same.” .Liberia spent years recovering from civil wars from 1989-2003 that killed hundreds of thousands of people and then was hit more recently by low prices for its chief exports, iron ore and rubber, and an Ebola outbreak from 2014-16. INFRASTRUCTURE A PRIORITY Slideshow (2 Images) .More than 60 percent of Liberians depend on agriculture for their livelihood and multinationals like Malaysia-based Sime Darby ( SIME.KL ) have invested heavily in palm oil plantations. But the sector has languished due to low productivity, forcing Liberia to import more than 80 percent of its staple foods. .Weah has also made repairing Liberia’s hollowed-out infrastructure a priority. He grew up in Monrovia’s Clara Town slum and can look out on the derelict lots and gutted streets from the upstairs balcony where he spoke to Reuters. .“The roads for connectivity are vital. We have partners and we have revenue that we will make sure will come in to build our roads,” he said. .Weah, who starred for top European clubs such as AC Milan and Paris Saint Germain in the 1990s, has parlayed his rags-to-riches biography into political success but faces criticism that he lacks the experience and knowledge for the job. .He has in turn promised to surround himself with first-rate advisers and appealed to Liberians living overseas to return home. .“We will have economists who will put us on track. They will look at what is in the coffers and then work out how to move forward,” he said. .In the days since he became president-elect, security guards in sharp suits and ties have appeared outside the house and a new watch tower rises above 10-foot walls reinforced with barbed wire. .But Weah insisted that his new-found status would not go to his head. .“I don’t want my title to define my character,” he said as he walked the property, exchanging jokes with the staff. “I don’t think as a president I will change.” Writing by Aaron Ross, Editing by William Maclean', 'output': "[['George Weah', 'PERSON', 'Is_Member_Of', 'Coalition for Democratic Change', 'ORG'], ['Coalition for Democratic Change', 'ORG', 'Win', 'Election', 'EVENT'], ['George Weah', 'PERSON', 'Replace', 'Ellen Johnson Sirleaf', 'PERSON'], ['George Weah', 'PERSON', 'Set', 'Modest Goals', 'CONCEPT'], ['Liberia', 'GPE', 'Start', 'Export', 'ECON_INDICATOR'], ['Liberia', 'GPE', 'Repair', 'Decrepit Infrastructure', 'CONCEPT'], ['Liberia', 'GPE', 'Have', 'Agricultural Programs', 'CONCEPT'], ['Liberia', 'GPE', 'People', 'Able to Grow Their Own Food', 'CONCEPT'], ['Liberia', 'GPE', 'Export', 'Staple Foods', 'CONCEPT'], ['Liberia', 'GPE', 'Languished', 'Low Productivity', 'CONCEPT'], ['Liberia', 'GPE', 'Import', 'More Than 80 Percent', 'ECON_INDICATOR', 'of', 'Staple Foods', 'CONCEPT'], ['George Weah', 'PERSON', 'Make', 'Repairing Liberia’s Hollowed-out Infrastructure', 'CONCEPT', 'a', 'Priority', 'CONCEPT'], ['George Weah', 'PERSON', 'Grew Up', 'Monrovia’s Clara Town Slum', 'GPE'], ['Liberia', 'GPE', 'Have', 'Partners', 'CONCEPT'], ['Liberia', 'GPE', 'Have', 'Revenue', 'CONCEPT', 'to', 'Build', 'Roads', 'CONCEPT'], ['George Weah', 'PERSON', 'Parlayed', 'Rags-to-Riches Biography', 'CONCEPT', 'into', 'Political Success', 'CONCEPT'], ['George Weah', 'PERSON', 'Faces', 'Criticism', 'CONCEPT', 'that', 'Lacks', 'Experience and Knowledge', 'CONCEPT', 'for', 'Job'], ['George Weah', 'PERSON', 'Promise', 'Surround', 'Himself', 'with', 'First-rate Advisers', 'CONCEPT'], ['George Weah', 'PERSON', 'Appeal', 'Liberians Living Overseas', 'GPE', 'to', 'Return', 'Home', 'CONCEPT'], ['George Weah', 'PERSON', 'Have', 'Economists', 'CONCEPT', 'who', 'Put', 'Us', 'on', 'Track', 'CONCEPT'], ['George Weah', 'PERSON', 'Work Out', 'How to Move Forward', 'CONCEPT']]", 'category': 'closed_qa'}

Emaar Development jumped 3.8 percent and Emaar Malls added 1.8 percent. .Shares in the group fell sharply last year because of a slump in Dubai’s real estate market, but they have become the focus of investors betting that heavy spending by the government will buoy the economy and help the market stabilise this year. .Several other beaten-down Dubai stocks also rebounded on Wednesday, with amusement park operator DXB Entertainments surging 5 percent, although logistics firm Aramex stayed weak, edging down 0.2 percent. .The Dubai index has turned technically bullish this week, beginning to rebound from the bottom of an uptrend channel dating back to early 2016. Technically, a rise in coming months to near the top of the channel would not be surprising, and would take the index above 3,700 points. .Saudi Arabia’s index, which had fallen in the first two days of this year after the government hiked domestic gasoline prices, rebounded 0.7 percent to 7,224 points. .Banks led the market with 10 of 12 gaining ground. National Commercial Bank, the biggest, surged 3.1 percent, although trading volume was modest. .The Saudi index edged up just 0.2 percent last year but many fund managers expect a better 2018 because of higher government spending. Santhosh Balakrishnan and Faisal Potrik, analysts at Riyad Capital, issued a report predicting the index would hit 7,936 points this year. .They based the forecast on the market trading at 14.5 times estimated corporate earnings for 2019, helped by economic reform, expected decisions by MSCI and FTSE to include Riyadh in their emerging markets indexes, and the planned listing of oil giant Saudi Aramco in late 2018 fuelling interest in the market. .After three years of decline, Saudi corporate earnings have started to improve, led by banks and petrochemical firms. This should let price/earnings multiples expand, even though firms’ top lines have so far been stagnant, the analysts argued. .Blue chips were bought in Kuwait on Wednesday with National Bank of Kuwait, the biggest lender, gaining 2.4 percent and logistics giant Agility rising 1.6 percent. The Kuwaiti index climbed 1.4 percent. .Egypt’s blue-chip index fell 1.3 percent on Wednesday, although the broader EGX100 fared much better, slipping only 0.4 percent. .The blue-chip index was dragged down by Commercial International Bank, which fell 1.9 percent, and Global Telecom, which slipped 2.7 percent after saying Egyptian tax authorities were seizing money from its local bank accounts to obtain a contested tax payment of 990 million pounds ($56 million). The company said it would contest the action. HIGHLIGHTS .* The index rose 0.7 percent to 7,224 points. DUBAI .* The index gained 1.4 percent to 3,459 points.

{'input': '* Investors await clues on rate-hike path in Dec FOMC minutes * U.S. Dec ISM manufacturing data beat expectations * U.S. 2-year yield touches 9-year peak * Companies to sell $35 bln high-grade bonds this week - IFR (Updates market action after ISM data) By Richard Leong NEW YORK, Jan 3 (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury yields were little changed on Wednesday in advance of minutes of last months Federal Reserve meeting, where policy makers decided to raise short-term interest rates for a third time in 2017 and upgraded their view on U.S. economic growth. Bond markets around the world stabilized from Tuesdays selloff tied to hawkish comments from two European Central Bank officials, which propelled the 10-year German Bund yield to a two-month peak and the five-year U.S. yield to its highest level since April 2011. Some investors said Tuesdays yield rise was partly a reversal of the drop linked to typical year-end buying. A majority of yesterdays move was a move back of what happened over the year-end holiday, said Jason Celente, senior portfolio manager at Insight Investment in New York. Wednesdays initial drop in U.S. yields faded following a stronger-than-forecast report on U.S. manufacturing from the Institute for Supply Management. The industry groups index on U.S. factory activity unexpectedly rose to 59.7 last month from 58.2 in November. Analysts polled by Reuters forecast the ISM factory index likely came in at 58.1. Evidence of further expansion in the factory sector will likely support the notion of steady U.S. economic growth, perhaps allowing the Fed to increase rates up to three times in 2018. Investors are also awaiting clues on the path of future rate hikes in the minutes of the Dec. 12-13 meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). They hope the minutes, set for release at 2 p.m. (1900 GMT), will provide a better sense of the FOMCs view of business activity before the passage of the biggest rewrite of the U.S. tax code in 30 years. They want to know what the Fed was thinking about before tax reform was passed, Celente said. At 10:37 a.m. (1526 GMT), benchmark 10-year Treasury yield was down 0.5 basis point at 2.460 percent, while the 30-year yield was down 0.6 basis point at 2.806 percent. The two-year yield reached a nine-year high at 1.939 percent. It was last up 0.8 basis point to 1.931 percent. Tuesdays yield spike also stemmed from bond dealers hedging the slate of corporate bonds they underwrite this week, analysts said. Companies are expected to sell $35 billion in investment-grade corporate bonds this week, according to IFR, a Thomson Reuters unit.

{'input': 'By Aaron Pressman 10:50 AM EST .After years of conspiracy theories that Apple was purposely slowing older iPhones to prompt upgrade purchases, the opposite effect may be in play now, according to one Wall Street analyst. .Apple last month admitted that in recent years its iOS software intentionally slow the performance of older iPhones when the batteries degraded. Without the slowdown, the iPhones would suddenly shutdown when the aged batteries couldn’t provide enough power for peak performance. Along with an apology, Apple said it would replace the battery on any model of the iPhone 6 or later for just $29. .The offer, and the resulting improvement in performance for older iPhones, may prompt millions of people to forgo an upgrade to a new phone this year, Barclays analyst Mark Moskowitz says. “Our August Wireless survey suggests battery drain is No. 1 reason for users to upgrade to new device – therefore, a new battery may deter some upgrade intention,” Moskowitz writes in a research note on Wednesday. The analyst, who says he is worried Wall Street is “too optimistic” about iPhone sales, rates Apple’s stock “neutral.” .About three-quarters of the 675 million iPhones currently in use would be eligible and potentially in need of the battery upgrade, Moskowitz estimates. “Due to the large base, even a small percentage opting for battery replacement over upgrade could have meaningful impact on iPhone sales,” the analyst writes. .Get Data Sheet , Fortune’s technology newsletter. .Assuming just 10% of those eligible take the offer, and about one-third of the battery seekers would have otherwise bought a new iPhone this year, then Apple will lose out on sales of 16 million devices and $10.3 billion of annual revenue, the Barclays analyst forecasts. If half the battery swaps would have otherwise upgraded, Apple loses out on 27 million sales and $18.2 billion in revenue. .For context, Wall Street assumes Apple will bring in $274 billion of revenue in its 2018 fiscal year, according to FactSet Research, including sales of 241 million iPhones. .Shares of Apple (aapl) were up 1% to $173.94 in midday trading on Wednesday.

{'input': 'January 1, 2018 / 6:43 PM / Updated 2 hours ago Medical jargon may cloud doctor-patient communication 5 Min Read .(Reuters Health) - When patients misunderstand commonly used medical terms, communication and decision-making may suffer, UK researchers say. .In a survey of London oral and maxillofacial surgery clinic patients, more than a third of participants did not know the meaning of terms like “benign” or “lesion” and more than half could not define “metastasis” or “lymph node,” the study team reports in the British Dental Journal. .Communication between patient and practitioner is essential, the researchers write, but it may not be happening as often as doctors think it is. .“As a result, ill-informed patients tend to neglect timely treatment which can lead to very bad - sometimes disastrous - outcomes,” said Dr. Sidney Eisig of Columbia University’s College of Dental Medicine in New York, who wasn’t involved in the study. .“I’ve seen patients with premalignant lesions turn to cancer that otherwise might not have occurred had surgical treatment not been so delayed,” he told Reuters Health in a telephone interview. .Emma Hayes of King’s College Hospital, London, and her colleagues recruited 123 patients waiting for their appointments at the hospital’s outpatient clinic to anonymously answer questionnaires about the meanings of several medical terms. Participants also provided background information about themselves, including education level and whether English was their first language. .In a multiple-choice section of the questionnaire, they were asked to define: blister, ulcer, malignant, lesion and benign. In a free-written answer section, they were also asked to describe in their own words the meanings of: biopsy, tumor, lymph node, pre-malignant and metastasis. .Hayes’ team found that 90 percent of respondents correctly defined blister as a bubble of fluid under the skin. Ulcer came in at a distant second with just 70 percent choosing the appropriate definition as an open sore or break in the skin. .“The words blister and ulcer are frequently used in medical areas unrelated to dental care, which may explain why the two are the most recognized medical lexicon,” Eisig noted. “For example, a patient experienced foot or hand blisters in the past. A friend or family member once had a stomach ulcer.” .Forty-five percent of patients were able to define a biopsy as a test involving taking a sample, but 30 percent wrongly defined it as a test specifically for cancer. .Benign and metastasis were the least understood terms, with 33 percent of patients responding “Don’t know” for the meaning of benign and just 6 percent correctly defining metastasis as the spread of a cancer to other areas of the body. Many patients also seemed to mistake “metastasis” for other words, offering responses such as “foot bone” (metatarsal) or “breast condition, very painful” (mastitis). .The researchers found that nearly 27 percent of participants did not speak English as a first language, which is a higher rate than London as a whole, at 22 percent, they note. But when the researchers looked just at those whose first language was English, they saw no differences in the number of correct answers based on educational level. .The study authors did not respond to a request for comments. .According to the U.S. National Institutes of Health, providers in many fields, including emergency room settings, surgery requiring anesthetics and breast cancer clinics, grapple with how best to effectively communicate with patients. .Efforts to bridge this gap include encouraging the use of plainer language in written materials and providing interpreting services for non-English speakers. .Eisig notes that some of the biggest challenges to effectively communicating with patients stem from growing bureaucracy within healthcare and are not so easily remedied. .“Over the past decade or so there have been many changes to healthcare, many of which are driven by finances. Some of these changes aren’t always beneficial,” he said. .“Frequently the doctor’s back may be to the patient as entries are being made into the electronic health record. Doctor-patient communication is now being done increasingly through email. These are just two examples that may lead to communication failures because practitioners are spending less time with patients, which results in diminished relationships thus increasing the likelihood for patient misinterpretation.” .SOURCE: go.nature.com/2zMEzbt British Dental Journal, online December 1, 2017.', 'output': "[['Researchers', 'PERSON', 'Report', 'Terms', 'CONCEPT'], ['Patients', 'PERSON', 'Do_not_know', 'Meanings', 'CONCEPT'], ['Communication', 'CONCEPT', 'Essential', 'Practitioner_and_Patient', 'PERSON'], ['Patients', 'PERSON', 'Neglect', 'Timely_Treatment', 'CONCEPT'], ['Dr. Sidney Eisig', 'PERSON', 'Noted', 'Patients_with_Premalignant_Lesions', 'CONCEPT'], ['Emma Hayes', 'PERSON', 'et_al.', 'Recruited', 'Patients', 'PERSON'], ['Patients', 'PERSON', 'Anonymously_Answered', 'Questionnaires', 'CONCEPT'], ['Questionnaires', 'CONCEPT', 'Contained', 'Medical_Terms', 'CONCEPT'], ['Patients', 'PERSON', 'Provided', 'Background_Information', 'CONCEPT'], ['Researchers', 'PERSON', 'Found', '90_Percent_Correctly_Defined', 'Blister', 'CONCEPT'], ['Researchers', 'PERSON', 'Found', 'Ulcer_at_70_Percent', 'CONCEPT'], ['Researchers', 'PERSON', 'Found', '45_Percent_Defined_Biopsy_Correctly', 'CONCEPT'], ['Researchers', 'PERSON', 'Found', '30_Percent_Wrongly_Defined_Biopsy', 'CONCEPT'], ['Researchers', 'PERSON', 'Found', 'Benign_and_Metastasis_Least_Understood', 'CONCEPT'], ['Researchers', 'PERSON', 'Found', '27_Percent_Did_not_Speak_English_as_First_Language', 'CONCEPT'], ['Researchers', 'PERSON', 'Found', 'No_Differences_in_Correct_Answers_based_on_Educational_Level', 'CONCEPT'], ['Providers', 'PERSON', 'Grapple', 'Effective_Communication', 'CONCEPT'], ['NIH', 'ORG', 'Noted', 'Challenges_in_Communication', 'CONCEPT'], ['Efforts', 'CONCEPT', 'Include', 'Plainer_Language', 'CONCEPT'], ['Efforts', 'CONCEPT', 'Include', 'Interpreting_Services', 'CONCEPT'], ['Eisig', 'PERSON', 'Noted', 'Growing_Bureaucracy_within_Healthcare', 'SECTOR'], ['Eisig', 'PERSON', 'Noted', 'Changes_Driven_by_Finances', 'CONCEPT'], ['Eisig', 'PERSON', 'Noted', 'Doctor-Patient_Communication_Failures', 'CONCEPT']]", 'category': 'closed_qa'}
{'input': 'January 3, 2018 / 7:16 AM / Updated 8 minutes ago Happy Christmas for Next spreads cheer among UK clothing retailers James Davey 5 Min Read .LONDON (Reuters) - British clothing chain Next ( NXT.L ) reported better-than-expected Christmas sales, helped by colder weather, sending shares across the sector higher on hopes other retailers have defied forecasts for gloomy festive trading. FILE PHOTO: A woman shelters beneath an umbrella as she walks past a branch of Next in Manchester, Britain September 21, 2017. REUTERS/Phil Noble/File Photo .Next shares were up 7.4 percent at 1230 GMT on Wednesday after it also raised its full-year profit forecast, while shares in rivals Marks & Spencer ( MKS.L ) and Primark owner Associated British Foods ( ABF.L ) gained 1.5 and 2.2 percent respectively. .With Britain’s consumers being squeezed by slow wage growth and the jump in inflation that followed the 2016 Brexit vote, expectations for Christmas spending had been subdued. .However, Next, the first major listed retailer to update on festive trading, reported full price sales growth of 1.5 percent in the 54 days to Dec. 24, a period covering the bulk of its financial fourth quarter. .That beat company guidance for a fall of 0.3 percent and follows third quarter growth of 1.3 percent. Growth in online sales more than compensated for lower sales in stores. .“We have long believed that conditions were not as bad as many believed for the consumer and we expect the next few weeks’ statements to show that companies with the right offer can do very well,” said analysts at Peel Hunt. .Separately on Wednesday department store John Lewis [JLPLC.UL] reported strong trading in the week to Dec. 23, with total sales up 8.9 percent. It enjoyed its biggest ever week for fashion sales. .Next CEO Simon Wolfson told Reuters he was “a lot more confident” about the retailer’s prospects than he was a year ago when the company issued a profit warning. .Next trades from more than 500 stores in the UK and Ireland and operates the Directory internet and home shopping business. .It had been Britain’s most successful clothing retailer this century in terms of profits but has faltered over the last two years due to a shift in spending away from clothing towards holidays and entertainment. Its shares had fallen 7 percent over the last year prior to Wednesday’s update. KEEPING FAITH WITH STORES Slideshow (2 Images) .CEO Wolfson cautioned that many of the issues Next faced over the last 12 months would linger in 2018. .Subdued UK consumer demand driven by a decline in real income and the shift to spending on leisure at the expense of clothing remained major challenges, said Wolfson. .But he said cost price inflation would reduce to 2 percent in the first half of its 2018-19 year and disappear in the second half. .The Next figures illustrated the contrasting fortunes of trading in its stores and online. Sales at stores fell 6.1 percent but online sales were up 13.6 percent. .Those numbers will fuel the debate over Next’s strategy of continuing to add retail space. .Next’s first half results, published in September, showed 53 percent of total sales from stores and the balance from online. .Next is still expanding its store base, with plans for up to 200,000 square feet of additional space in 2018-19. It believes that even if shops become less productive, they will not make losses. .Wolfson said that even if retail like-for-like sales were falling by 10 percent, the stores would remain an asset. .“What we’ve had to get our heads around is the idea that you can invest in a shop today that will make less profit in year 10 than it does in year one but because you get your money back in two years it’s still a very good investment,” he said. .Next upgraded its central pretax profit guidance for 2017-18 to 725 million pounds, up from previous guidance of 717 million pounds but well below the 790.2 million pounds made in 2016-17. .Next forecast full price sales growth of about 1 percent in the 2018-19 year and another fall in profit to 705 million pounds, with costs growing faster than sales. That outcome would be a third straight year of profit decline. .But Next also flagged a 300 million pounds share buyback in 2018-19 that would boost earnings per share.

REUTERS/Thierry Gouegnon .More than 60 percent of Liberians depend on agriculture for their livelihood and multinationals like Malaysia-based Sime Darby have invested heavily in palm oil plantations.

{'input': 'January 3, 2018 / 8:46 AM / Updated 6 hours ago Thomas Monson, president of the Mormon church, dies at 90 Reuters Staff 3 Min Read .(Reuters) - Thomas Monson, leader of the Mormon church, has died at his home in Salt Lake City, Utah, the church said on Wednesday. He was 90. .Monson became the 16th President of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, as the religion is officially known, in 2008. As its leader, members of the faith considered him a prophet who received divine revelations. .Monson died late on Tuesday surrounded by his family, the church said in a statement on its website. .“President Monson had all the hallmarks of an unassuming servant of the Lord,” the church statement said. .Mormons worship Jesus, believing in a “restored” church, with living apostles and prophets. They believe in the Bible, as well as an additional book of scripture, the Book of Mormon. .The church, which was formally organized in 1830 in Upstate New York, reported last year to have 15.8 million members worldwide. They include the 2012 Republican presidential nominee and former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney and actor Katherine Heigl. .Romney praised Monson on Wednesday for his work and said he would be remembered for his love and compassion for “every one of God’s children.” FILE PHOTO: Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints First Counselor Henry B.

Find someone who is having a hard time, or is ill, or lonely, and do something for them. That’s all I would ask,” he said during an interview on his 81st birthday, according to the church.

{'input': 'January 2, 2018 / 12:50 PM / Updated 8 minutes ago German police accuse AfD lawmaker of incitement over anti-Muslim tweet Joseph Nasr 4 Min Read .BERLIN (Reuters) - German police have asked prosecutors to investigate a far-right lawmaker for possible incitement to hatred after she criticized a police force for tweeting in Arabic “to appease the barbaric, Muslim, rapist hoards of men”. .Police in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW) posted a New Year’s Eve greeting in Arabic as well as German, English and French. Cologne, a city where groups of mainly Arab immigrants were accused of sexual assaults at New Year’s Eve celebrations two years ago, is located in the state. .“What the hell is wrong with this country? Why is the official page of police in NRW tweeting in Arabic,” Beatrix von Storch, a member of the anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany (AfD), wrote in a Dec. 31 tweet that was later deleted by Twitter after receiving complaints from members of the public. .“Are they seeking to appease the barbaric, Muslim, rapist hoards of men?” she added. .Twitter suspended her account for some 12 hours after she posted the message, saying it breached the micro-blogging website’s rules that bar users from posting hateful messages. .Social media platforms face hefty fines in Germany if they fail to remove hateful postings swiftly, and companies like Facebook and Twitter have hired extra staff to monitor such messages. .The NRW police deployed large numbers of officers to secure New Year’s street parties in large cities this year and said celebrations were largely peaceful. .‘CENSORSHIP’ .Prosecutors in NRW must first decide whether they should deal with the police complaint against von Storch or transfer the case to Berlin authorities given that her constituency is in the capital. .If prosecutors deem there is sufficient grounds to launch an official criminal investigation against von Storch, they would first have to ask parliament to suspend her immunity before proceeding with a case. .Cologne Chief Prosecutor Ulf Willuhn said prosecutors must now decide whether von Storch’s message amounted to “inciting people to commit violence against a certain section of society”. .Twitter also deleted a message by AfD member Alice Weidel in which she said German authorities wanted Germans to live with criminal mobs of migrants. .The AfD won seats in parliament for the first time in September, riding a wave of discontent against Chancellor Angela Merkel’s decision in 2015 to open Germany’s borders to more than a million asylum-seeking migrants. .The AfD, which says Islam is incompatible with the German constitution, is the third largest party in parliament. It has upended German politics by stealing voters from Merkel’s conservatives and the center-left Social Democrats, making coalition building more difficult. .AfD leaders reacted angrily to Twitter’s decision to delete the two postings under a new law passed by parliament in June that authorizes fines of up to 50 million euros against social media networks if they don’t promptly remove hateful content. .“The censorship law of (Justice Minister) Heiko Maas has already showed on the first day of the year its ability to curtail freedom of expression,” said AfD co-leader Alexander Gauland. “I call on every social media user to take action against such oppression by reposting the deleted comments again and again!”   Hans-Edzard Busemann and Reuters TV; Editing by Peter Graff', 'output': "[['German police', 'ORG/GOV', 'Accuse', 'Beatrix von Storch', 'PERSON'], ['Beatrix von Storch', 'PERSON', 'Possible_Incitement_To', 'Hatred', 'CONCEPT'], ['Beatrix von Storch', 'PERSON', 'Criticize', 'Police', 'ORG/GOV'], ['Police', 'ORG/GOV', 'Tweet', 'In_Arabic', 'CONCEPT'], ['North Rhine-Westphalia', 'GPE', 'Has', 'Police', 'ORG/GOV'], ['Beatrix von Storch', 'PERSON', 'Write', 'Tweet', 'CONCEPT'], ['Tweet', 'CONCEPT', 'Delete', 'Twitter', 'COMP'], ['Twitter', 'COMP', 'Suspend', 'Beatrix von Storch', 'PERSON'], ['Twitter', 'COMP', 'Bar_Users_From', 'Hateful_Messages', 'CONCEPT'], ['Germany', 'GPE', 'Face_Hefty_Fines', 'Social_Media_Platforms', 'COMP'], ['Social_Media_Platforms', 'COMP', 'Hire', 'Staff', 'ORG'], ['NRW_Police', 'ORG/GOV', 'Deploy', 'Large_Numbers_Of_Officers', 'ORG'], ['New_Year_Eve_Celebrations', 'EVENT', 'Largely_Peaceful', 'NRW_Police', 'ORG/GOV'], ['NRW_Prosecutors', 'ORG/GOV', 'Decide', 'Transfer_Case_To_Berlin_Authorities', 'ORG/GOV'], ['NRW_Prosecutors', 'ORG/GOV', 'Ask_Parliament', 'Suspend_Immunity', 'CONCEPT'], ['NRW_Prosecutors', 'ORG/GOV', 'Decide', 'Launch_Criminal_Investigation', 'CONCEPT'], ['Cologne_Chief_Prosecutor', 'PERSON', 'Decide', 'Whether_Message_Amounted_To', 'CONCEPT'], ['Twitter', 'COMP', 'Delete', 'Alice Weidel', 'PERSON'], ['AfD', 'ORG', 'Win_Seats_In_Parliament', 'September', 'DATE'], ['AfD', 'ORG', 'Ride', 'Wave_Of_Discontent', 'CONCEPT'], ['AfD', 'ORG', 'Say_Islam_Incompatible_With_German_Constitution', 'CONCEPT'], ['AfD', 'ORG', 'Third_Largest_Party_In_Parliament', 'CONCEPT'], ['AfD', 'ORG', 'Steal_Voters_From', 'Merkel’s_Conservatives', 'ORG'], ['AfD', 'ORG', 'Make_Coalition_Building_More_Difficult', 'CONCEPT'], ['AfD_Leaders', 'ORG', 'React_Angrily', 'Twitter’s_Decision', 'CONCEPT'], ['AfD_Leaders', 'ORG', 'Call_On_Users', 'Repost_Deleted_Comments', 'CONCEPT'], ['Heiko_Maas', 'PERSON', 'Pass_Law', 'Authorize_Fines', 'CONCEPT'], ['Social_Media_Networks', 'COMP', 'Promptly_Remove_Hateful_Content', 'CONCEPT']]", 'category': 'closed_qa'}

Otto’s board included LinkedIn’s well-known co-founder Reid Hoffman. .Jadallah said that he had agreed to sell his startup to an unnamed public company and was blocked from seeking additional funding as part of the planned deal. However, the suitor backed out on the day the deal was supposed to be finalized, leaving Otto without the necessary cash to continue operations. .Get Data Sheet , Fortune’s technology newsletter. .“I was stunned. The reason is still not understood,” Jadallah wrote. “We had extended our cash to get to the closing date, and now were left without alternatives.” .Jadallah attempted to spin the debacle as positive, saying that the process of starting Otto “wasn’t an easy or predictable journey, but it was incredibly rewarding.” .“The only comfort I can find at this moment is to believe that Team Otto and the technology and product we created, will serve as seeds to grow and change industries in new and exciting directions,” he wrote. .Jadallah also shared his thoughts about the risk of running a venture capital-backed company, most of which eventually collapse after failing to create sustainable businesses. He said that startups are companies that “lack a control of their own destiny because they rely on investor cash infusions to operate.” .Although Otto’s digital door locks cost hundreds of dollars more than conventional locks, Jadallah said that “concerns about the $699 price point melted away as homeowners valued the security, design and performance of a new generation of home access that Otto represented” based on feedback from customers who tested its locks. .August, another maker of web-connected door locks, dropped the price of its flagship August Smart Lock by $80 to $149 in September, and then sold itself to Swedish lock giant Assa Abloy the next month.

{'input': 'EDINBURGH (Reuters) - It’s known as Scotland’s second national drink, but a change in the secret recipe for Irn Bru, a sticky-sweet fizzy beverage prized as a hangover cure, has prompted outrage among its many devotees..Once sold under the macho slogan “Made in Scotland from Girders!”, the drink was actually 10 percent sugar. But manufacturer AG Barr has decided to halve that to make Irn Bru less vulnerable to new anti-obesity regulations and higher taxes..Ryan Allen, who described the drink as a “national treasure”, is behind an online petition calling on the company to reverse its decision. “Hands off our IRN BRU” has more than 8,000 supporters..“I believe that a responsible adult should have the choice as to what poisons they want to put in their body,” he told BBC radio, adding that he had stockpiled the classic version..“I’ve got 24 glass bottles in my loft that will do me for emergencies.”.AG Barr, based just outside Glasgow, said last autumn it would cut the amount of sugar in Irn Bru at the start of 2018 to just below 5 grams per 100 ml from 10 grams..That followed a British government decision to impose a levy on makers of sugary drinks. Replacing some of the sugar with sweeteners will take Irn Bru out of the top tax band and reduce its calorie count to about 66 from 140, the manufacturer said..For Allen, the world is a tough enough place without messing with his favorite soft drink..“It’s ... well known to alleviate the effects of a hangover and is many a persons’ craving, savior or go-to drink after a night on the tiles,” he said..“I think to deny people in that condition their crutch would be a crime.”.Reporting by Elisabeth OLeary; Editing by Alistair Smout and Robin Pomeroy.

Kotb will continue co-hosting the 10 a.m. hour of “Today” with Kathie Lee Gifford. .“It’s 2018 and we are kicking off the year right because Hoda is officially the co-anchor of Today,” said Guthrie, 46, who announced the news during the program’s opening moments. .Kotb, 53, quickly filled in as co-host when Lauer was fired on Nov. 28 after a female colleague complained to NBC officials about a pattern of inappropriate sexual behavior that began while they were on assignment at the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics in Russia, according to the network. .At least two other women went to NBC with similar complaints against Lauer following the first allegation. None of the women has been publicly identified. .“Repairing the damage will take a lot of time and soul searching and I‘m committed to beginning that effort,” Lauer said after he was fired. .Reuters has not independently verified the accusations. .Kotb joined NBC News in 1998 as a correspondent and has co-hosted the fourth hour of “Today” with Gifford since 2008. She also hosts a program on Sirius XM satellite radio. .“Over the past several weeks, Hoda has seamlessly stepped into the co-anchor role alongside Savannah, and the two have quickly hit the ground running,” NBC News Chairman Andrew Lack said in an email to staff, according to Today.com. .#SavannahHodaTODAY was a top-trending topic on Twitter following the announcement as fans and NBC News colleagues congratulated the host on her new position.

Under a managed distribution plan, to the extent that sufficient investment income is not available on a monthly basis, the fund will distribute long-term capital gains and/or return of capital in order to maintain its managed distribution level. You should not draw any conclusions about the fund’s investment performance from the amount of the fund’s distributions or from the terms of the fund’s managed distribution plan. The Board of the fund may amend the terms of the plan or terminate the plan at any time without prior notice to the funds shareholders. The amendment or termination of a plan could have an adverse effect on the market price of the fund’s common shares. The plan will be subject to periodic review by the Board. With each distribution that does not consist solely of net investment income, the fund will issue a notice to shareholders and an accompanying press release which will provide detailed information regarding the amount and composition of the distribution and other related information. The amounts and sources of distributions reported in the notice to shareholders are only estimates and are not being provided for tax reporting purposes. The actual amounts and sources of the amounts for tax reporting purposes will depend upon the fund’s investment experience during its full fiscal year and may be subject to changes based on tax regulations. The fund will send shareholders a Form 1099-DIV for the calendar year that will tell them how to report these distributions for federal income tax purposes. The fund may at times distribute more than its net investment income and net realized capital gains; therefore, a portion of the distribution may result in a return of capital. A return of capital may occur, for example, when some or all of the money that shareholders invested in the fund is paid back to them. A return of capital does not necessarily reflect a fund’s investment performance and should not be confused with ‘yield’ or ‘income’. Any such returns of capital will decrease the funds total assets and, therefore, could have the effect of increasing the funds expense ratio. In addition, in order to make the level of distributions called for under its plan, the fund may have to sell portfolio securities at a less than opportune time. For estimated source information for distributions paid in prior periods, please see MFS.com and click on the following links: Products, Closed-End Funds, Dividend Source Information..*Distribution from Other Sources may contain sources of income other than ordinary income, such as short term capital gains, long term capital gains, or return of capital, which can not be determined until the close of the funds fiscal year end. Distributions that are treated for federal income tax purposes as a return of capital will reduce a shareholders tax basis in his or her shares and, to the extent the distribution exceeds a shareholders adjusted tax basis, will be treated as a gain to the shareholder from a sale of shares.

It was projected to raise roughly $30 billion over a decade. .After drawing harsh criticism from both political parties as well as medical industry lobbying groups, the U.S. Congress approved a suspension of the levy in 2015. .The suspension expired on New Year’s Day after unsuccessful last-ditch efforts by Republicans. .Republicans would have automatically killed the tax if they had succeeded in repealing Obamacare last year. The levy remained in Republican-crafted tax legislation signed by President Donald Trump on Dec. 22. .Supporters of the tax say it has helped provide health insurance to millions of previously uninsured Americans. .Critics, who have vowed to keep fighting the levy, say it has stifled the medical industry and slashed jobs. .“The tax has had a significant negative impact on medical innovation and has resulted in the loss or deferred creation of jobs,” the Advanced Medical Technology Association lobbying group said on its website.

FILE PHOTO: A pumpjack brings oil to the surface in the Monterey Shale, California, April 29, 2013. REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson/File Photo .U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures CLc1 were at $60.34 a barrel at 0739 GMT, down 3 cents from their last close, though still not far off the price of $60.74 reached on the previous day that was the highest since June 2015. .Brent crude futures LCOc1 - the international benchmark for oil prices - were at $66.49 a barrel, down 8 cents but still not far off the price of Tuesday’s high of $67.29 that was the most since May 2015. .Traders said the dips followed indications that markets had recently overshot as U.S. production is set to rise further and doubts are emerging about whether demand growth can continue at current levels. .Ole Hansen, head of commodity strategy at Denmark’s Saxo Bank warned ”multiple but temporary supply disruptions“ like the North Sea Forties and Libyan pipeline outages (and) protests across Iran ... helped create a record speculative long bet.” .With the pipeline outages resolved and the protests in Iran showing no signs of impacting its oil production, Hansen said there was potential for a price downturn in early 2018, especially due to rising U.S. output. .“It is only a matter of time before the 10 million barrel per day (bpd) production target will be reached,” Hansen said. .U.S. oil production C-OUT-T-EIA has risen by almost 16 percent since the middle of 2016, hitting 9.75 million bpd at the end of last year. .There was also some concern that Russian oil output is in fact not falling. The country is the world’s biggest oil producer and one of the key backers, together with the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), in cutting supplies. .As part of the supply cut deal, Russia pledged to reduce its output by 300,000 bpd from the 30-year monthly high of 11.247 million bpd hit in October 2016, which it achieved by the second quarter of 2017, according to Russian energy ministry data. .For the whole of 2017, however, Russian output rose to an average of 10.98 million bpd, compared with 10.96 million bpd in 2016 and 10.72 million bpd in 2015. .“Even though they have reduced that astronomical number (from Oct. 2016), they are still producing more (in 2017 than in 2016),” said Matt Stanley, a fuel broker at Freight Investor Services (FIS) in Dubai. .Saxo Bank’s Hansen said he also had “some concerns about the Chinese economy in 2018 that ultimately could lead to lower than expected demand growth.” .As a result, he said his bank saw lower crude prices by the end of the year, with Brent at $60 per barrel and WTI at $57.

Photographed by Getty Images By Chris Morris 10:49 AM EST .If your perennial New Year’s resolution is to curb your chocolate consumption, then it may be easier to keep than you think — in about 30 years. Experts warn the world’s chocolate supply could dwindle to almost nothing by 2050. .The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration says we reached a tipping point in 2016. And, unless major changes are made, the number of areas where cacao trees can grow will be dramatically reduced . .Those trees, which are critical for the production of chocolate, only grown in very specific conditions. But climate change is raising temperatures and reducing rainfall in the narrow band of the Earth where they grow most prevalently. .The NOAA report isn’t new — nor is the study it cites, which was conducted in 2013. However, it has recently turned a lot of heads. .The upside is that even though the U.S. has withdrawn from the Paris Climate Accord , most countries are still taking steps to reduce carbon emissions — and many large U.S. companies say they still plan to honor the terms of the accord. .And NOAA notes that despite things looking dire for chocoholics , the worrisome predictions are not certain. The study NOAA cited examined 294 locations that grow cacao trees. Of those, only 10.5% showed increasing suitability for cacao production; the remaining 89.5% were likely to become less suitable by 2050. .However, says researcher Peter Läderach, who headed the study, “these changes in climatic suitability are predicted to take place over a time period of almost 40 years, so … there is time for adaptation.” .Sweet.

{'input': 'By Andrew Nusca 11:06 AM EST .Have you seen Black Mirror ? I am utterly captivated by season four of the dystopian Netflix series, which for the unfamiliar is a high-tech spin on The Twilight Zone . I’m still making my way through the binge, but one unsettling episode directed by Jodie Foster, “Arkangel,” stuck with me. In it, a mother nearly loses her young daughter after she wanders off at the park. Terrified of a repeat incident, she signs up for Arkangel, a new service that, through use of an implant, allows the parent to use a mobile device to track the child’s location, monitor her vitals, and even see what the child is seeing. A parental mode pixelates in real time any visual that elevates stress. It’s heady stuff. .You can quickly see where this goes wrong. Even in our earliest years, negative experiences help us learn how to live in the world. (That pan burned my hand; I should be wary of touching things on the stove.) And what seems like an honest tool for parenting in a child’s earliest years quickly becomes highly invasive when that child grows into a teenager. (Real time visuals? No thanks.) If you saw last year’s film The Circle , based on the Dave Eggers novel , you’ll know this dichotomy well. Or the film Ex Machina two years before it. Or the documentary you’re living every day you scroll through Facebook , sync your Fitbit, or ask Alexa a question. .Why the spate of paranoid techno-thrillers? Because we’re still grappling with the implications of capabilities we’ve never had before. We know that fully autonomous vehicles can solve a lot of society’s problems, but we don’t know where they can fail us in other ways besides the obvious. We know that personalized medicine is the way forward, but we haven’t yet seen what happens when that power is abused. And so forth. .Techno-optimism will be on fantastic display next week at CES, the annual consumer electronics show in Las Vegas. After six (mostly) terrifying episodes of Black Mirror , it might be just what the robo-doctor ordered. .This essay was originally published in Data Sheet, Fortune’s daily newsletter about technology.

( bit.ly/2Cx1LQr ) .GM Canada sold 302,826 vehicles in 2017, up 13.3 percent over the previous year, contrasting with sales in the much bigger U.S. market where the Cadillac maker recorded a fall of 1.3 percent. .However, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles ( FCHA.MI ) ( FCAU.N ), reported a fall in monthly and yearly sales, hurt by a lower demand for its Jeep and Dodge branded vehicles in Canada. .The company said it sold 17,654 vehicles in December, a drop of 6 percent compared to the year earlier. Full-year sales fell 4.2 percent to 267,052 vehicles. .Ford reported an 11.1 percent drop in monthly auto sales, selling 17,565 vehicles in December. However, full-year sales were up by 1.3 percent. .“We are expecting a decline in auto sales for the year in 2018,” Scotiabank analyst Carlos Gomes said, noting that a slower Canadian GDP growth and vehicle price increases outpacing income growth to be likely factors.

Empty Niki check-in counters are seen at Vienna International Airport in Schwechat, Austria December 14, 2017. REUTERS/Heinz-Peter Bader .Fairplane, seeking to recover more than 1 million euros ($1.2 million) it says Niki owes to passengers, filed separate legal cases on Tuesday to block insolvency proceedings in Berlin and to open them instead in Austria. .Although the sum sought is relatively small, a spokesman for Air Berlin liquidator Lucas Floether said the complaint could derail the sale of Niki to IAG’s low-cost Vueling operation that was agreed last week. .“If the complaint before the Charlottenburg Court (in Berlin) succeeds, the sale of Niki to IAG would be greatly endangered,” the spokesman said. A ruling by the court on the case was due this week. .British Airways’ owner IAG said last Friday it would buy Niki for 20 million euros ($24 million) and provide up to 16.5 million euros in additional liquidity to the company. .The sale to IAG, which had been in exclusive talks to acquire the airline, appeared to mark the final chapter in the demise of Air Berlin, the former No.2 German air carrier that earlier owned Niki. .Fairplane argues however that Niki, which is registered in as a company in Austria, had been profitable but had lost access to bridge financing when insolvency proceedings were opened in Germany in December, grounding planes and stranding passengers. .Spokesman Ronald Schmid said that dragging Niki into the German insolvency process was wrong, and that passengers stood a better chance of getting their money back in the Austrian courts. .“We want to ensure that the insolvency is carried out in Austria - where it belongs - so that there are no conflicts of interest,” Schmid told Reuters. .IAG declined to comment. .In appointing Floether to liquidate Air Berlin in December, a German insolvency judge was of the opinion that, although Niki was registered as a company in Austria, its centre of main interest was in fact in Germany. .($1 = 0.8301 euros) Reporting by Douglas Busvine and Thomas Seythal; additional reporting by Sangameswaran S in Bengaluru; Editing by Adrian Croft', 'output': "[['Fairplane', 'ORG', 'Raise', '1 million euros', 'ECON_INDICATOR'], ['Fairplane', 'ORG', 'Block', 'Niki sale to IAG', 'EVENT'], ['Niki', 'COMP', 'Operate_In', 'Austria', 'GPE'], ['Niki', 'COMP', 'Owe', 'Passengers', 'ORG'], ['Air Berlin', 'COMP', 'Liquidator', 'Lucas Floether', 'PERSON'], ['IAG', 'ORG', 'Buy', 'Niki', 'COMP'], ['IAG', 'ORG', 'Provide', 'Liquidity', 'FIN_INSTRUMENT'], ['IAG', 'ORG', 'Own', 'British Airways', 'COMP'], ['Air Berlin', 'COMP', 'Own', 'Niki', 'COMP'], ['Fairplane', 'ORG', 'Argue', 'Niki profitable', 'CONCEPT'], ['Niki', 'COMP', 'Lose', 'Access to bridge financing', 'CONCEPT'], ['Fairplane', 'ORG', 'Ensure', 'Insolvency carried out in Austria', 'GPE'], ['IAG', 'ORG', 'Decline', 'Comment', 'CONCEPT']]", 'category': 'closed_qa'}

REUTERS/Regis Duvignau Exact figures have been kept under wraps ahead of an announcement on January 15, but the sources said Airbus handed over a record monthly total of jets in December, surpassing the previous monthly peak of 111 seen in the closing weeks of 2016..Coming on top of 591 deliveries posted between January and November last year, that implies deliveries of at least 703 aircraft in 2017 as a whole, up at least 2 percent from 2016..A spokesman for Airbus declined comment..Airbus stuck throughout 2017 to an official target of more than 700 deliveries for the year, but abandoned a more ambitious informal goal of more than 720 deliveries in October due to continued delays in engine deliveries for the A320neo family..Airbus officials have said the delays have now eased, following a two-year wrangle with supplier Pratt & Whitney over late engines for the company’s fastest-selling jet..It is the second year in a row that Airbus has been forced to accelerate sharply in December, with that month’s deliveries accounting for at least 16 percent of the annual total..Without disclosing numbers, Chief Operating Officer Fabrice Bregier thanked staff in a memo for “huge collective efforts” that had seen the company break records for deliveries logged both in one month and in one year, industry sources said..Still, insiders said the strong industrial performance would be seen by many as a personal coup for Bregier, weeks before he is due to leave the company after losing a bid to succeed Chief Executive Tom Enders, who is himself leaving in 2019..Airbus is bracing for more internal changes this year as it emerges from a top-level power struggle and rows over the handling of corruption investigations, but ended 2017 with what appears to be a grand slam performance from its current regime..Besides ending the year on record output, Airbus is also heading for a record December in new business after soon-to-retire sales chief John Leahy announced the firming up of more than 700 orders, equivalent to a year’s production..Both Leahy and Bregier are leaving Airbus in coming weeks, handing their responsibilities to executives from outside the planemaking inner circle: Airbus Helicopters CEO Guillaume Faury, who will replace Bregier as head of the planemaking division, and Rolls-Royce civil engines head Eric Schulz, who will replace Leahy after he retires later this month..Airbus will remain in second place on deliveries in 2017 behind the world’s largest planemaker, Boeing, but analysts say the outcome of the order race depends on how many of the new sales make it into the end-year tally of net orders..Reporting by Tim Hepher; Editing by Ingrid Melander and Geert De Clercq.

{'input': 'Market Insider Fed minutes show last stand by Yellen and the doves The final interest rate hike of the Yellen era was met by the usual divided Fed, but the scales will now tip toward the more hawkish voices. In minutes from its last meeting, the Federal Open Market Committee revealed a lingering divide over low inflation even as the Fed moved to raise interest rates. Janet Yellen will preside over one more meeting before Fed governor Jerome Powell takes over as Fed chair in February, and he will be surrounded by a new group of more hawkish voices. 1 Hour Ago | 04:37 .The final interest rate hike of the Yellen era was met by the usual divided Fed, but the scales will now tip toward the more hawkish voices. .The Federal Open Market Committee approved a quarter-point rate hike at its late December meeting, with most officials backing the continued path of gradual rate hikes. But according to the minutes from the Fed meeting , released Wednesday, there were Fed officials who were concerned by low inflation expectations even as others said they thought the tight labor market and tax hikes could help boost inflation. .As Janet Yellen prepares to hand the baton to incoming chair Jerome Powell in early February, the Fed is already commanding a more hawkish tone. Economists are increasingly expecting a potential four rate hikes this year, versus the three currently forecast by the Fed. .It just seems the usual. The so-called hawks at the Fed are gradualists who think monetary policy needs to be normalized as the economy normalizes, said Ward McCarthy, chief financial economist at Jefferies. They dont want to fall behind the curve. .On the other side are the so-called doves, who McCarthy described as still perpetually pessimistic. This dose of policy normalization is an anathema to them, and theyll grab onto any straw to slow down the process. Frankly, this is their last stand, and they lost. .Yellens Fed was centered around a dovish core, including Yellen as Fed chair, former Fed vice chair Stanley Fischer and New York Fed President William Dudley. Fischer has recently left the Fed, and Dudley is expected to leave in the middle of the year. .The Yellen Fed has raised rates five times, the first hikes since the Fed took the fed funds rate to zero during the financial crisis. It also has begun a process to scale back the Feds balance sheet, expanded to $4.5 trillion by quantitative easing under former Fed chair Ben Bernanke as he sought to boost the economy. .The Fed likes to be proactive, but its reactionary, said Diane Swonk, CEO of DS Economics. Swonk said the strengthening labor market and higher wages would have helped push the Fed to hike rates and will push it further. .The tax cuts should further pressure labor costs in the U.S. at the same time the job market is tightening. Its a whole new world to have labor markets tighten again. Its something employers are just beginning to grasp, Swonk said. .Whats going to be interesting to see is [wage growth.] We know that theres going to be these one time earnings and theres going to be minimum wage increases and thats going to start showing up, Swonk said. A number of companies have announced one time bonuses for employees since the tax bill was signed into law last month. .Also this year the FOMC loses some of its more dovish voices, like Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari and Chicago Fed President Charles Evans. Both voted against the rate hike. They are leaving the FOMC as part of a normal rotation making way for other members who happen to be more hawkish, like Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester. .The Feds next meeting is Jan. 30 and 31, and while it is Yellens final meeting, there is not expected to be a rate hike. But the new Fed members could find their voices, including Randal Quarles, vice chair for supervision. .President Donald Trump has also nominated former Fed official and Carnegie Mellon professor Marvin Goodfriend. He is a monetary policy scholar and one of his key criticisms of the Fed is they shouldnt fall behind the curve on inflation, said McCarthy. .Sluggish inflation has been an ongoing issue for the Fed, with some members expecting an eventual return to the Feds 2 percent target and others wondering if there are other negative issues holding it back. .The market, during the Yellen era, was highly skeptical the Fed would raise rates because of low inflation, but as the Powell Fed and its new members are about to take over that view is changing, in part because the economy has accelerated and the tax cuts mean it could accelerate further. .At the end of the day, the question is what happens to interest rates longer term, said Swonk. The economy is doing better, and the Fed is going to have to react to that.

{'input': 'France Emmanuel Macron Vows to Keep Up the Pace of French Reform A videograb made on December 31, 2017 shows French President Emmanuel Macron delivering his New Years wishes from the Elysee palace in Paris. STRINGER AFP/Getty Images By Reuters 9:52 PM EST .French President Emmanuel Macron vowed on Sunday to rapidly push through economic and political changes in France over the coming months and said he would seek to jolt Europe into reforming too. .The televised New Year’s speech was the 40-year-old president’s first year-end address following his electoral victory in May. Macron made clear he would tackle even potentially thorny domestic issues, like a new immigration law. .Macron, who left political rivals reeling when he won power barely a year after launching a new centrist movement, has already rattled his way through an overhaul of French labour rules, in spite of street protests and a pushback from unions. .“I will ensure all voices, including contrary ones, are heard. But all the same, I will not stop acting,” Macron said, seated a marble table in his office at the Elysee Palace. The formula of the speech was largely in keeping with the one favoured by many of his predecessors, despite speculation Macron would seek to shake up France’s New Year presidential rite of passage too. .With parties to his left and right divided or scrambling to regroup under new leaders, Macron will benefit from a window of opportunity at home to push through more reforms in 2018 as the opposition flounders, analysts say. .Macron’s popularity ratings have recently recovered from a slump as he tries to carve out an international profile and starts delivering on campaign pledges. .But his next steps also carry risks as he seeks changes that could spawn more of a popular backlash than he has previously faced, including a proposed overhaul of unemployment benefits which aims to tighten conditions for these subsidies. .Detractors have labelled the former investment banker the “president of the rich”, and he also faces the challenge of maintaining a grip over his young party. .The French government plans changes in 2018 to immigration laws that have sown unease even among some members of Macron’s Republic on the Move (LREM) movement. They include a tougher line on deporting migrants who have been refused asylum. .Macron vowed on Sunday that the country would continue to welcome refugees and immigrants, though he added France could not do so “without rules.” .An unapologetic pro-European, Macron beat far-right, eurosceptic National Front leader Marine Le Pen in the election run-off and has since sought to kickstart a drive towards greater euro zone integration. .For more economic news from France, see Fortune’s video: .He appealed on Sunday directly to people across Europe to step up and have more of a say in shaping the future of the European Union and giving it a “jolt”, including through citizen consultations. .“We need to recover a European ambition to be a more sovereign, more united, more democratic Europe,” Macron said. “I need for us, together, not to give way on anything, neither to nationalists nor to the sceptics.” .Echoing an address earlier on Sunday by German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Macron said Germany and France in particular would strive to work together.

{'input': '0 COMMENTS LONDON— Diageo DEO 0.27% PLC is suspending all of its advertising on Snapchat after the U.K. advertising watchdog ruled that the alcohol giant didn’t take sufficient care to ensure that a campaign from its Captain Morgan rum brand wasn’t seen by users under the U.K.’s legal drinking age of 18..In June, Captain Morgan ran a “Sponsored Lens” on Snap Inc.’s SNAP 2.34% Snapchat that let users alter pictures of their faces, in this case to look like the brand’s pirate mascot alongside two glasses clinking together..The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) said on Wednesday in London that the lens breached the U.K. advertising code because it was likely to appeal to users under the age of 18 and was “inappropriately targeted.” While Diageo only directed the ad at people over 18, the targeting data was based on unverified age information that users supply when they register for an account. .In a statement, a Diageo spokeswoman said the company “took all reasonable steps” to ensure the ad wasn’t directed at users under 18, using data provided by Snapchat and applying an age filter. .But the ad watchdog called into question the accuracy of Snapchat’s data since users self-report their age..The Advertising Standards Authority ruled that this Snapchat lens sponsored by Captain Morgan was in breach of the U.K. rules surrounding advertising to children. Photo: Advertising Standards Authority The U.K. ad code states that no media outlet should be used to advertise alcoholic drinks if more than 25% of its audience is under 18. According to the ruling, Diageo said that data provided from Snap in 2016 showed 77% of U.K. Snapchat users were registered as 18 or older..However, the ASA referenced 2016 research from U.K. communications regulator Ofcom that indicated that while the minimum age to sign up for Snapchat is 13, 34% of a group of 104 social media users between the ages of 8 and 11 were on the app. And 58% of a group of 12- to 15-year-olds said they were on Snapchat..The data “called into question the adequacy of self-reported age as the sole means of targeting,” the ASA wrote, concluding Captain Morgan hadn’t taken “sufficient care” to ensure the ad wasn’t directed at children. The ASA also concluded that the “child-like cartoon image” for the interactive and augmented features of the lens were likely to appeal to kids..“We have now stopped all advertising on Snapchat globally whilst we assess the incremental age verification safeguards that Snapchat are implementing,” Diageo said in its statement..While the ASA’s ruling is limited to a single campaign, it could potentially encourage more alcohol marketers to put in tougher targeting safeguards when running campaigns on apps popular among young people. The issue also could be relevant on other big social media platforms, including Facebook and Twitter, that ask people to self-report their age..Since the Captain Morgan campaign ran, Snap has launched “Audience Lenses,” a version of “Sponsored Lenses” that allow advertisers to not only direct their ads at certain age groups, but to supplement that targeting with “lifestyle categories,” which are based on users’ interests and activity within the app..CMO Today Newsletter Get your daily dose of media and advertising news with WSJ’s CMO Today newsletter. Sign up here ..Guidance from the Committee of Advertising Practice, which writes the U.K. advertising code, states that “where possible,” marketers placing age-restricted ads should aim to support their targeting with behavioral data that excludes people with interests strongly associated with younger people—a teen music festival, for example..In a statement, a Snap spokeswoman said the company was “disappointed” with the ASA’s decision and disagrees Captain Morgan intentionally directed its ad to an underage audience because it applied the accurate age-targeting methods made available at the time. The spokeswoman also said Snapchat uses its own data, plus that of third-party measurement services such as Nielsen, to validate users’ real ages..“Snapchat now offers among the most sophisticated targeting in the industry and by introducing new tools such as Audience Lenses and incorporating additional signals into our targeting, advertisers have a reliable and flexible way to ensure their ads reach the right audience,” the statement continued..Having an advertiser pull spending, even temporarily, is a blow to Snap at a time when it is struggling to grow its 178 million daily users and meet Wall Street’s expectations for ad revenue growth . Snap’s third-quarter revenue rose 62% to $207.9 million, but analysts had expected $236.9 million..Diageo declined to comment about the company’s Snapchat advertising budget. The company said in filings that it spent about £1.8 billion ($2.4 billion) on marketing in the year ended June 30, up from about £1.6 billion in its previous financial year. .The Snapchat campaign isn’t the first time in recent years the Captain Morgan brand has run afoul of the ASA. In 2016, the watchdog banned a Captain Morgan TV ad for implying that alcohol could give you confidence. And in 2014, the Diageo brand was ordered to pull a Facebook ad after the ASA ruled the ad broke the rules for suggesting that alcohol could help people overcome boredom . .Write to Lara O’Reilly at lara.oreilly@wsj.com', 'output': "[['Diageo', 'ORG', 'Suspend', 'Snapchat', 'ORG'], ['Captain Morgan', 'PRODUCT', 'Breach', 'U.K. rules', 'CONCEPT'], ['Diageo', 'ORG', 'Use', 'Data from Snap', 'ORG'], ['Snapchat', 'ORG', 'Provide', 'Unverified age information', 'CONCEPT'], ['Diageo', 'ORG', 'Apply', 'Age filter', 'CONCEPT'], ['ASA', 'ORG', 'Call into question', 'Accuracy of Snapchat’s data', 'ORG'], ['Snapchat', 'ORG', 'Use', 'Self-reported age', 'CONCEPT'], ['ASA', 'ORG', 'Conclude', 'Captain Morgan didn’t take sufficient care', 'CONCEPT'], ['U.K. ad code', 'CONCEPT', 'State', 'No media outlet should be used', 'CONCEPT'], ['ASA', 'ORG', 'Refer', '2016 research from Ofcom', 'ORG'], ['Ofcom', 'ORG', 'Indicate', '34% of 8- to 11-year-olds were on Snapchat', 'CONCEPT'], ['ASA', 'ORG', 'Conclude', 'Captain Morgan hadn’t taken sufficient care', 'CONCEPT'], ['ASA', 'ORG', 'Conclude', 'Interactive and augmented features likely to appeal to kids', 'CONCEPT'], ['Diageo', 'ORG', 'Stop', 'All advertising on Snapchat globally', 'CONCEPT'], ['ASA', 'ORG', 'Potentially', 'Encourage more alcohol marketers', 'CONCEPT'], ['Snap', 'ORG', 'Launch', 'Audience Lenses', 'CONCEPT'], ['Snap', 'ORG', 'Allow', 'Advertisers to not only direct their ads at certain age groups', 'CONCEPT'], ['Snap', 'ORG', 'Supplement', 'Targeting with lifestyle categories', 'CONCEPT'], ['Snap', 'ORG', 'Use', 'Its own data', 'CONCEPT'], ['Snap', 'ORG', 'Use', 'Third-party measurement services', 'CONCEPT'], ['Snapchat', 'ORG', 'Offer', 'Sophisticated targeting', 'CONCEPT'], ['Snapchat', 'ORG', 'Introduce', 'New tools such as Audience Lenses', 'CONCEPT'], ['Snapchat', 'ORG', 'Incorporate', 'Additional signals into targeting', 'CONCEPT'], ['Snap', 'ORG', 'Validate', 'Users’ real ages', 'CONCEPT'], ['Snapchat', 'ORG', 'Have', 'Reliable and flexible way to ensure ads reach the right audience', 'CONCEPT'], ['Snap', 'ORG', 'Struggle', 'To grow its daily users', 'CONCEPT'], ['Snap', 'ORG', 'Meet', 'Wall Street’s expectations for ad revenue growth', 'CONCEPT'], ['Diageo', 'ORG', 'Decline', 'To comment about the company’s Snapchat advertising budget', 'CONCEPT'], ['Captain Morgan', 'PRODUCT', 'Run afoul of the ASA', 'CONCEPT'], ['ASA', 'ORG', 'Ban', 'A Captain Morgan TV ad', 'CONCEPT'], ['ASA', 'ORG', 'Order', 'Captain Morgan to pull a Facebook ad', 'CONCEPT']]", 'category': 'closed_qa'}

A report from Expand, part of the BostonConsulting Group and IHS Markit, has estimated that top global banks and asset managers will have spent $2.1 billion last year to comply with the rules. Lawton expects the new regime to trigger consolidation as the competition it aims to promote proves too much for some. .Credit rating agency Standard & Poor’s said there would likely be more losers than winners from the profound changes being ushered in. .The aim is increase transparency and bolster investor protection to avoid some of the problems of the 2007-2009 financial crisis. Stock, bond, derivatives, commodity and other trades must all be reported to a repository, giving regulators a trove of data to track trades and try to spot bubbles early after failing to see the last crisis coming. .When the rules go live on Wednesday, fund managers and others must for the first time fill in a transaction report with up to 65 bits of data within 15 minutes of a trade - or risk being fined. The rules, known as MiFID II or Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II, represent a revamp of the2007 MiFID law to increase transparency and investor protection and broaden its scope to take in more financial products. MiFID II will be a journey and not a one off event inJanuary, is how one national regulator responded to questions about how trading will unfold on January 3. LIQUIDITY WATCH .The European Securities and Markets Authority, which is overseeing the roll out, published a flurry of statements just before Christmas to tackle some remaining road bumps. “ESMA, in close cooperation with the national regulatory authorities across the EU, has carried out a broad range of work ... to ensure that the framework is in place to ensure a smooth transition from MiFID I to MiFID II,” ESMA Chairman Steven Maijoor told Reuters. So far, only 11 of the EU’s 28 member states have written MiFID II fully into national law. But ESMA has said that all firms can carry on even if their home state has not completed the legislative process. .Germany, France and Britain, home to the EU’s top financial centres, are among the 11 EU states whose national laws are upto speed and big banks are likely to be ready. Royal Bank of Scotland’s ( RBS.L ) NatWest Markets has conducted a “soft launch”. From January 2 to January 4, some of its staff will work through the night. “Day One will hopefully go smoothly and we are as ready as we can be,” Giovanni Mazzocchi, head of macro distribution inEurope for Barclays ( BARC.L ), said. “There are a few overnighters going on to make sure everything will work on the day.” .Industry officials predict light trading volumes initially rather than paralysis. .A European bond strategist said trading glitches could become a “self-fulfilling prophecy” as people feel their way under the new rules. .“Everyone says I want to be careful for that first month of the year, and if everyone does that, we won’t have liquidity,” the strategist said. .DISRUPTIVE ESMA will make use of the new data to set curbs on trading positions in commodities and cap off-exchange trading of shares or so-called “dark pools.” MiFID II also gives investors more information about which trading platforms offer the best deals, and asset managers will have to show investors who is paying for stock research. A fundamental aim of the original MiFID was to increase competition in share trading by allowing new platforms to take on centuries-old rivals like the London Stock Exchange ( LSE.L ). Upstarts like Chi-X went on to become among the biggestpan-European share trading platforms and regulators want MiFIDII to bring “disruption” to trading in other assets, forcing companies to become more agile. “There will be interesting times over the next few years with new players entering the market and both clients and banks making full use of the new available data to shape their activities in the market,” Mazzocchi said. Christian Voigt, senior regulatory adviser at Fidessa, a provider of trading software, said MiFID II did not represent a revolution in share trading, but would have a big impact on bonds, commodities and derivatives, where electronic trading will increase. “For fixed income and off-exchange derivatives, the wholemindset needs to change as a lot of trades are still done over the phone,” Voigt said. .(This version of the story corrects reference to “this year” to “last year”, in the fifth paragraph.)

Lawyers are not expecting a judgment imminently. .When announcing its proposed ban in April 2016, the FCA had said Hussein “understood that Libor submissions should not be made for the benefit of trading positions” and “closed his mind to the risk” that his preferences for the Libor rates could influence submissions. “In so doing he acted recklessly and lacked integrity,” the FCA said. .Authorities have fined 11 financial institutions around $9.0 billion and charged about 30 people in a global inquiry into how banks set rates such as Libor and Euribor, which determine the rates on trillions of loans and financial contracts globally. .The FCA, along with U.S. and Swiss counterparts, fined UBS a total of $1.5 billion over Libor conduct in 2012. UBS said at the time it regretted what it called “inappropriate and unethical behavior.” .The case is listed until Jan. 9. Reporting by Kirstin Ridley.

{'input': 'By Susie Gharib January 2, 2018 .Just about every old-line American company talks about the actions it’s taking to be an innovator and a disruptor these days. If you want to know how that works in real life, take a look at 175-year-old Stanley Black & Decker (swk) , the legendary manufacturer of tools and household hardware, and its leadership under James Loree. .When Loree took charge of the Connecticut-based company in 2016, he said it bothered him that the company had not articulated its “purpose.” Even though Loree had been involved in the 2010 merger of Stanley Works with Black & Decker and had worked at the company for 20 years, he wanted an answer to the question, “what societal need do we fulfill?”. .It took learning new leadership skills and an entire year of working closely with the company’s 45,000 employees to answer that. Loree, who spent his career working on the finance side of the business, says the hardest part was “letting go” of the traditional command and control style of leadership. .“It’s letting loose and being confident enough to believe the answer will come and it will be a very good answer. And it did,” Loree says of the company-wide process of reinventing Stanley Black & Decker. “It was a great answer.” .Stanley Black & Decker defines its purpose as providing the best tools “for those who make the world.” .One of the positive outcomes of this team effort, Loree says proudly, is that he now has constant conversations with employees, mostly through social media. .“People feel like they can say what they want to say. If they have an issue they want to get on the table, they can do it,” he says. “I cannot overstate the importance of social media to fulfilling this initiative and purpose.” .Watch the video above for more of our conversation with Loree.

A South Korea won note is seen in this illustration photo May 31, 2017. REUTERS/Thomas White/Illustration/Files .Asia’s fourth largest economy is highly reliant on shipments of high-end goods such as ships, automobiles and electronics for its growth but also had one of the region’s hottest currencies in 2017, which has weighed on its export competitiveness. .People familiar with matter told Reuters on Wednesday the nation’s foreign exchange authorities may look into ways to spur investment abroad should the local currency appreciate on a consistent basis. .This would be separate to regulators’ market operations to curb the won’s volatility, which would still be conducted when required. .A spokesperson for the finance ministry, which is responsible for foreign exchange regulation, declined to comment on the matter. .The sources did not provide details on the potential measures and declined to elaborate when asked if the steps could include tax breaks similar to those announced in 2015. .Back then, South Korea offered up to 10 years in tax exemptions on investment gains from funds that put more than 60 percent of assets into overseas stocks. The scheme took effect in February 2016 and expired in December. .Rising domestic interest rates, strong exports and heightened U.S. scrutiny on South Korea’s foreign exchange regime have made it harder for Seoul to tame the won, which rose 13 percent last year, its best annual gain in 13 years. A currency dealer works at a dealing room of a bank in Seoul, South Korea, December 17, 2015. REUTERS/Kim Hong-Ji/Files .Measures that encourage capital out of the country could help policymakers remove some of the upward pressure on the currency without needing to use direct intervention in the foreign exchange market, a sticking point in Seoul’s relations with the Washington. .South Korea posted current account surpluses for 68 straight months through to October last year, data from the Bank of Korea showed. .In October, the U.S. Treasury Department kept South Korea on a “monitoring list” of countries in its report on foreign exchange policies of its major trading partners, along with China, Japan and Germany. .In value terms, South Korean exports surged to their highest on record in 2017 thanks to soaring global demand for memory chips, cars and petrochemical products. .The government sees exports growing 4 percent this year, slowing from the 15.8 percent growth in 2017. In terms of the value of goods sold, South Korea exported $573.9 billion in 2017, marking it the best year since 1956 when such records began. .At the same time, the strong won has been a point of pain for local manufacturers. .A think tank from Hyundai Motor last month flagged risks from the won’s strength against the Japanese yen, warning current levels could hurt demand for South Korean cars in markets such as Europe and the U.S. in the year ahead. .Citing its Hyundai Sonata sedan as example, Lee Bo-sung, a director at the think tank, said the model was only 2 percent cheaper than Honda’s Accord as of 2017 in the U.S. market, compared with 10 percent in 2011. .The won snapped six days of gains and weakened 0.3 percent against the dollar on Wednesday but closed just below its three-year high of 1,064.5 per dollar, hit on Tuesday.

We expect far more cooperation from Pakistan in the fight against terrorism.” .The comments followed an angry tweet from President Donald Trump on Monday that the United States had been rewarded with “nothing but lies and deceit” for “foolishly” giving Pakistan more than $33 billion in aid in the last 15 years. .“They give safe haven to the terrorists we hunt in Afghanistan, with little help. No more!” he tweeted. .Pakistan civilian and military chiefs on Tuesday rejected “incomprehensible” U.S. comments and summoned American Ambassador David Hale to explain Trump’s tweet. .Relations with Washington have been strained for years over Islamabad’s alleged support for Haqqani network militants, who are allied with the Afghan Taliban. FILE PHOTO: U.S. President Donald Trump talks to reporters before departing the White House for a visit to the Walter Reed Medical Center in Washington, DC, U.S., December 21, 2017. REUTERS/Jim Bourg/File Photo .The United States also alleges that senior Afghan Taliban commanders live on Pakistani soil, and has signaled it will cut aid and take other steps if Islamabad does not stop helping or turning a blind eye to Haqqani militants crossing the border to carry out attacks in Afghanistan. .In 2016, Taliban leader Mullah Mansour was killed by a U.S. drone strike inside Pakistan and in 2011, al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden was found and killed by U.S. troops in the garrison town of Abbottabad. STATE DEPT: PAKISTAN NEEDS TO EARN ITS AID .At the State Department on Tuesday, spokesman Heather Nauert said Pakistan knows what it needs to do, including taking action against the Haqqani network and other militants. .Pakistan needs to “earn, essentially, the money that we have provided in the past in foreign military assistance,” she said. .Islamabad bristles at the suggestion it is not doing enough to fight militants, noting that its casualties at the hands of Islamists since 2001 number in the tens of thousands. .Pakistani Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi on Tuesday chaired a National Security Committee meeting of civilian and military chiefs, focusing on Trump’s tweet. The meeting, which lasted nearly three hours, was brought forward by a day and followed an earlier meeting of army generals. .The committee, in a statement issued by the prime minister’s office, did not name Trump but spoke of “deep disappointment” at a slew of critical comments coming from U.S. officials over the past few months. .“Recent statements and articulation by the American leadership were completely incomprehensible as they contradicted facts manifestly, struck with great insensitivity at the trust between two nations built over generations, and negated the decades of sacrifices made by the Pakistani nation,” it said.

That included some that had been received at end-2016. .The efforts generated 104 million francs in additional tax revenue. .Meanwhile, the canton of Lucerne said it had generated 15.5 million francs in additional taxes from new self-disclosures last year, seeing an uptick in the number of cases but a decline in the sums each taxpayer declared. .Figures for other cantons were not immediately available.

Fully booked equipment and crews have, for example, sent shares of Keane Group ( FRAC.N ), a smaller competitor, almost 37 percent higher since early December. .Weatherford would have taken a 30 percent stake in OneStim, which was expected to contribute to the its earnings. .“There was a scenario whereby Weatherford may have been in a position to monetize its 30 percent stake,” said Byron Pope, a managing director in Tudor Pickering Holt’s equity research division. .There would have been precedent for Schlumberger wanting to own 100 percent of the joint venture, he added, pointing to Schlumbergers acquisition of Camerons ownership stake in their OneSubsea joint venture in 2016.

{'input': 'SANTA CLARITA, CA, Jan. 02, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- USEI CANNABIS INITIATIVES CORP, a wholly owned subsidiary of U.S. ENERGY INITIATIVES CORPORATION, INC. (OTC PINK: USEI) a California based company, poised to capitalize on California’s legal cannabis industry focusing on the manufacturing and extraction of oil from cannabis is pleased to announce today that its Board of Directors has declared two (2) dividends in the form of warrants to purchase shares of the Companys common stock; a 1 for 10 or a 10% warrant to shareholders of record on the record date..The warrants will be issued on pay-date of February 26, 2018 to shareholders of record as of February 16, 2018. Each shareholder of the Companys common stock will receive one warrant for every ten shares owned (10% of their holdings) as of the record date (with the number of warrants rounded up to the nearest whole number). The first warrant will entitle the holder to purchase 10% of their holdings of the Companys common stock equal to the exercise price per share price on March 30, 2018. The second warrant will entitle the holder to purchase 10% of their holdings of the Companys common stock at an exercise price share price on March 30, 2018 plus a 50% premium to that same price (For example .010 +.005 =.015). Combined these warrants represent a 20% warrant to the shareholder. (For example, if a shareholder has 1 million shares these warrants allow the shareholder of record to acquire an additional 200,000 shares at these prices). These warrants will be for a 3-year term from the date of issue, non-transferable, with the restricted shares being issued upon exercise. Funds raised because of this warrant will fund the companys likelihood of becoming a reporting issuer with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC and future growth of the company’s business model. Further details of this warrant will be disclosed in a future press release..According to Anthony Miller, CEO, “ This is the 3rd dividend that the company has issued to its shareholders in recent years… and this event has been planned for a few months. It is management’s opinion that the issuance in this case is a beneficial activity for this firm, as it is transitioning to a more profitable business model. This month we begin to actively manufacture oil extractions from cannabis utilizing the MRX extraction technology that we purchased last month. This device is the first in a series of purchases that the company will make to keep pace in the growing demand for cannabis products now that California has become the largest legal marketplace in the world..“Our goal is to produce a wide range of extracted products; and we plan to actively expand our operation aggressively. We start production on the first day of delivery and these devices will all be operating on a 24/7/365 basis. Revenue produced will allow us to become profitable on the first day of operation; and we believe that there is capital to fund growth. However, it is management’s opinion that the warrant announced today will fuel our expansion so that we can continue to grow our opportunity. Management further believes that any additional capital raising should come from those folks who are and have been participating in the growth of this company thus far. Creating toxic dilution of the company’s stock to the detriment of those who have been holding strong with us for some time is not acceptable..“Management, further intends to file with the SEC to finally become a reporting issuer so that the company will have greater transparency and become financially responsible. The cannabis industry requires true and an accurate representation of every dime made, and it is our goal to become fully transparent to the public market in the same manner. In the coming weeks, management will continue to disclose our progress including video of our delivery and extraction operations and post our progress on twitter, Facebook and on the company’s websites. Our future is awesome, and it was encouraging to see other companies, in the state of Oregon, that started just like us, with just one device and now up to 7 additional devices in less than three year (3) making millions of dollars annually, and their market is only 1/5 of the California market..“Finally, management believes that this 20% dividend could represent a significant opportunity to the shareholders of record because of two reasons 1) management believes that if management executes its business model the share value should become commensurate with revenues produced by our activities and 2) capital provided because these dividends will fuel growth, and both factors could be beneficial to the company.” commented Miller.About U.S. Energy Initiatives: U.S. Energy Initiatives Corporation (OTC PINK: USEI) is a diverse energy firm.

{'input': '$37 million in sales and $2.9 million in adjusted EBITDA 3 New DXP locations in the Pacific Northwest Differentiated custom tooling including full service tool and cutter grinding facility Servicing customers in the aerospace, construction, medical and firearm markets.HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- DXP Enterprises, Inc. (NASDAQ: DXPE) today announced the completion of the acquisition of Application Specialties, Inc. (“ASI”), a leading distributor of cutting tools, abrasives, coolants and machine shop supplies. DXP funded the acquisition with cash on the balance sheet..Founded in 1989, ASI is headquartered in Auburn, Washington and operates out of three locations in the state of Washington including Auburn, Everett and Vancouver. ASI is focused on serving customers in the aerospace, construction, medical and firearm markets with approximately 33 employees..Financial terms of the transaction were not disclosed. Signing of the definitive agreement occurred on January 1, 2018. Sales and adjusted EBITDA were approximately $37 million and $2.9 million, respectively. Adjusted EBITDA was calculated as income before tax, plus interest, depreciation and amortization, and non-recurring items that will not continue after the completion of the acquisition..David R. Little, Chairman and CEO remarked, “We are pleased to welcome the ASI employees to the DXP team. ASI is a unique, well-run business focused on providing value-added solutions to its customers. ASI will provide DXP’s Metal Working division with new geographic territory and enhance DXP’s end market mix. With ASI, we continue to build on our strategy of providing a breadth of technical products and services on a regional and local level. ASI provides us scale and access to the U.S. Pacific Northwest market, while allowing us to continue to serve our customers evolving needs.

ASI complements and diversifies DXP’s products and end markets. This transaction will be positive for ASI and DXP’s customers, employees and shareholders.”.ASI was advised by Cascadia Capital, LLC..Non-GAAP Financial Measures.DXP supplements reporting of net income with non-GAAP measurements, including EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow. This supplemental information should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the unaudited GAAP measurements..The Company believes EBITDA provides additional information about: (i) operating performance, because it assists in comparing the operating performance of the business, as it removes the impact of non-cash depreciation and amortization expense as well as items not directly resulting from core operations such as interest expense and income taxes and (ii) the performance and the effectiveness of operational strategies. Additionally, EBITDA performance is a component of a measure of the Company’s financial covenants under its credit facility. Furthermore, some investors use EBITDA as a supplemental measure to evaluate the overall operating performance of companies in the industry. Management believes that some investors’ understanding of performance is enhanced by including this non-GAAP financial measure as a reasonable basis for comparing ongoing results of operations. By providing this non-GAAP financial measure, together with a reconciliation from net income, the Company believes it is enhancing investors’ understanding of the business and results of operations, as well as assisting investors in evaluating how well the Company is executing strategic initiatives..About DXP Enterprises, Inc..DXP Enterprises, Inc. is a leading products and service distributor that adds value and total cost savings solutions to industrial customers throughout the United States, Canada, Mexico and Dubai.

{'input': 'January 1, 2018 / 6:43 PM / Updated 2 hours ago Regular carry-out meals linked to higher body and blood fats in kids Shereen Lehman 5 Min Read .(Reuters Health) - Children who eat restaurant carry-out, or “takeaway,” meals once a week or more tend to have extra body fat and long-term risk factors for heart disease, suggests a UK study. .In the study of 9- and 10-year-olds, the kids who ate carry-out most often also consumed more calories but fewer vitamins and minerals compared with kids who rarely or never ate carry-out food, the authors report in Archives of Disease in Childhood. .“Frequent consumption of takeaway foods could potentially be increasing children’s risk of future coronary heart disease and type 2 diabetes by increasing their LDL cholesterol and body fat,” lead author Angela Donin told Reuters Health in an email. .“Takeaway outlets are increasing, as is consumption with more than half of teenagers reporting eating takeaways at least twice a week,” said Donin, a researcher at St. George’s, University of London. .In adults, regular consumption of carry-out meals is associated with higher risk of obesity, coronary heart disease and type 2 diabetes, but little is known about the effects it may be having on children’s health, Donin said. .“We, therefore, wanted to see how much takeaway food children were eating and if there were any effects on their health.” .The researchers analyzed data from the Child Heart and Health Study in England, which looked at potential risk factors for heart disease and diabetes in pre-teens. Participants included about 2,000 kids aged 9 and 10 years at 85 primary schools in three cities: London, Birmingham and Leicester. .The children answered questions about their usual diets, including how often they ate carry-out meals purchased from restaurants. Foods purchased at convenience stores or grocery stores were not included in the category. Photos of common foods were provided to help the kids recall and estimate portion sizes. .About one quarter of the children said they never or rarely ate carry-out meals and nearly half said they ate carry-out less than once per week. Just over one quarter said they ate these kinds of meals at least once per week. .Boys were more frequent consumers of carry-out meals than girls, as were children from less affluent backgrounds. .The study team used the kids’ dietary responses to calculate calorie counts and nutrient intake. Among regular consumers of carry-out meals, the foods eaten were higher-calorie and higher-fat, while protein and starch intake was lower and intake of vitamin C, iron, calcium and folate was also lower compared with kids who didn’t eat these types of meals. .Researchers also measured the children’s height, weight, waist circumference, skinfold thickness and body-fat composition. In addition, they measured blood pressure and took blood samples for cholesterol levels. .There were no differences in blood pressure or how well the kids’ bodies used insulin based on who regularly ate carry-out meals. But skinfold thickness, body fat composition and blood fats like LDL (bad) cholesterol all tended to be higher in regular consumers of carry-out meals. .“Children who ate more takeaway meals had higher total and LDL cholesterol (both important risk factors for coronary heart disease) and body fat.,” Donin said. .“Most people who order takeout usually purchase fast food, which is high in sodium, fat, and calories,” noted Sandra Arevalo, who wasn’t involved in the study. .”Fast-food also has low nutritional value, which means it is low in vitamins, minerals, fiber and sometimes protein,” said Arevalo, a registered dietician who directs Nutrition Services and Community Outreach at Community Pediatrics, a program of Montefiore and The Children’s Health Fund, in New York. “If you eat these meals over a long period of time you can start seeing the health consequences associated with it.” .Arevalo recommends parents who need to bring home a meal, call the restaurant ahead of time to order salads, vegetables, brown rice, grilled meats and to provide a healthier meal for their children. .“The price might be a deterrent but you can cut portions in half and get two meals out of one large one,” she said by email. Another idea is to learn to prepare quick and healthy meals. .“For example, hummus, carrots, and crackers make a great lunch, as well as a tuna or turkey sandwich with lettuce and tomatoes. Eggs are an excellent source of protein, you can scramble an egg with spinach, onions, and tomatoes and have it with a toast,” she said. .SOURCE: bit.ly/2BGZnnD Archives of Disease in Childhood, online December 3, 2017.', 'output': "[['Regular carry-out meals', 'EVENT', 'Linked', 'Higher body and blood fats in kids', 'EVENT'], ['Children', 'PERSON', 'Eat', 'Restaurant carry-out', 'EVENT'], ['Children', 'PERSON', 'Tend', 'Extra body fat', 'CONCEPT'], ['Children', 'PERSON', 'Long-term risk factors for heart disease', 'CONCEPT'], ['Kids who ate carry-out most often', 'PERSON', 'Consume more calories', 'CONCEPT'], ['Kids who ate carry-out most often', 'PERSON', 'Consume fewer vitamins and minerals', 'CONCEPT'], ['Takeaway outlets', 'ORG', 'Increase', 'More than half of teenagers', 'PERSON'], ['Regular consumption of carry-out meals', 'EVENT', 'Associated', 'Higher risk of obesity', 'CONCEPT'], ['Regular consumption of carry-out meals', 'EVENT', 'Associated', 'Coronary heart disease', 'CONCEPT'], ['Regular consumption of carry-out meals', 'EVENT', 'Associated', 'Type 2 diabetes', 'CONCEPT'], ['Children', 'PERSON', 'Potentially increasing', 'Risk of future coronary heart disease and type 2 diabetes', 'CONCEPT'], ['Children', 'PERSON', 'Potentially increasing', 'LDL cholesterol and body fat', 'CONCEPT'], ['Researchers', 'PERSON', 'Analyzed', 'Data from the Child Heart and Health Study in England', 'EVENT'], ['Participants', 'PERSON', 'Include', 'About 2,000 kids aged 9 and 10 years', 'PERSON'], ['Kids', 'PERSON', 'Answer', 'Questions about their usual diets', 'EVENT'], ['Kids', 'PERSON', 'Estimate', 'Portion sizes', 'EVENT'], ['About one quarter of the children', 'PERSON', 'Say', 'They never or rarely ate carry-out meals', 'EVENT'], ['Nearly half', 'PERSON', 'Say', 'They ate carry-out less than once per week', 'EVENT'], ['Just over one quarter', 'PERSON', 'Say', 'They ate these kinds of meals at least once per week', 'EVENT'], ['Boys', 'PERSON', 'More frequent consumers', 'Carry-out meals', 'EVENT'], ['Children from less affluent backgrounds', 'PERSON', 'More frequent consumers', 'Carry-out meals', 'EVENT'], ['Regular consumers of carry-out meals', 'PERSON', 'Eat', 'Higher-calorie and higher-fat foods', 'EVENT'], ['Regular consumers of carry-out meals', 'PERSON', 'Intake', 'Lower protein and starch', 'EVENT'], ['Regular consumers of carry-out meals', 'PERSON', 'Intake', 'Lower vitamin C, iron, calcium and folate', 'EVENT'], ['Researchers', 'PERSON', 'Measure', 'Children’s height, weight, waist circumference, skinfold thickness and body-fat composition', 'EVENT'], ['Researchers', 'PERSON', 'Measure', 'Blood pressure and take blood samples for cholesterol levels', 'EVENT'], ['Regular consumers of carry-out meals', 'PERSON', 'Tend', 'Higher skinfold thickness', 'CONCEPT'], ['Regular consumers of carry-out meals', 'PERSON', 'Tend', 'Higher body fat composition', 'CONCEPT'], ['Regular consumers of carry-out meals', 'PERSON', 'Tend', 'Higher blood fats like LDL (bad) cholesterol', 'CONCEPT'], ['Sandra Arevalo', 'PERSON', 'Recommend', 'Parents who need to bring home a meal, call the restaurant ahead of time to order healthier meals', 'EVENT'], ['Sandra Arevalo', 'PERSON', 'Recommend', 'Learn to prepare quick and healthy meals', 'EVENT']]", 'category': 'closed_qa'}
{'input': ' 21 PM / Updated 11 minutes ago EMERGING MARKETS-LatAm markets kick off 2018 with a rally Reuters Staff 4 Min Read .By Bruno Federowski SAO PAULO, Jan 2 (Reuters) - Latin American markets started 2018 on Tuesday on a strong footing as solid global economic growth data drove investors to unwind year-end hedges. Chinas Caixin index of Chinese industry rose to a four-month high of 51.5 in December, confounding forecasts for a decline. The reading pointed to resilience for the worlds largest consumer of commodities even as Beijing cracks down on industrial pollution and engineers a cooling property market. It also bolstered expectations of global economic strength for the first month of the year amid strong readings on manufacturing in the euro zone. Currencies from Brazil, Mexico, Chile , Colombia strengthened between 0.9 percent and 1.7 percent. Stock indexes were up throughout the region, with Brazils benchmark Bovespa leading gains as traders unwound bets on a credit downgrade. Brazilian policymakers met in December with rating agencies to stave off a downgrade after lawmakers delayed a key vote on a plan to streamline the social security system and curb government spending. The market sought protection from what looked like an imminent sovereign downgrade, but that did not materialize, H.Commcor brokerage trader Cleber Alessie said. Metalúrgica Gerdau SA stock was the biggest gainer on the benchmark index after Commercial Metals Co agreed to acquire certain U.S. rebar assets owned by the Brazilian steelmaker.

FILE PHOTO: An Airbus logo is pictured during the delivery of the new Airbus A380 aircraft to Singapore Airlines at the French headquarters of aircraft company Airbus in Colomiers near Toulouse, France, December 13, 2017. REUTERS/Regis Duvignau .Exact figures have been kept under wraps ahead of an announcement on January 15, but the sources said Airbus handed over a record monthly total of jets in December, surpassing the previous monthly peak of 111 seen in the closing weeks of 2016. .Coming on top of 591 deliveries posted between January and November last year, that implies deliveries of at least 703 aircraft in 2017 as a whole, up at least 2 percent from 2016. .A spokesman for Airbus declined comment. .Airbus stuck throughout 2017 to an official target of more than 700 deliveries for the year, but abandoned a more ambitious informal goal of more than 720 deliveries in October due to continued delays in engine deliveries for the A320neo family. .Airbus officials have said the delays have now eased, following a two-year wrangle with supplier Pratt & Whitney ( UTX.N ) over late engines for the company’s fastest-selling jet. .It is the second year in a row that Airbus has been forced to accelerate sharply in December, with that month’s deliveries accounting for at least 16 percent of the annual total. .Without disclosing numbers, Chief Operating Officer Fabrice Bregier thanked staff in a memo for “huge collective efforts” that had seen the company break records for deliveries logged both in one month and in one year, industry sources said. .Still, insiders said the strong industrial performance would be seen by many as a personal coup for Bregier, weeks before he is due to leave the company after losing a bid to succeed Chief Executive Tom Enders, who is himself leaving in 2019. .Airbus is bracing for more internal changes this year as it emerges from a top-level power struggle and rows over the handling of corruption investigations, but ended 2017 with what appears to be a grand slam performance from its current regime. .Besides ending the year on record output, Airbus is also heading for a record December in new business after soon-to-retire sales chief John Leahy announced the firming up of more than 700 orders, equivalent to a year’s production. .Both Leahy and Bregier are leaving Airbus in coming weeks, handing their responsibilities to executives from outside the planemaking inner circle: Airbus Helicopters CEO Guillaume Faury, who will replace Bregier as head of the planemaking division, and Rolls-Royce ( RR.L ) civil engines head Eric Schulz, who will replace Leahy after he retires later this month. .Airbus will remain in second place on deliveries in 2017 behind the world’s largest planemaker, Boeing ( BA.N ), but analysts say the outcome of the order race depends on how many of the new sales make it into the end-year tally of net orders.

Simon Dawson/Bloomberg via Getty Images By Reuters 2:15 AM EST .Australia’s transport safety investigation agency said on Tuesday it plans to raise a seaplane that crashed into a Sydney river on New Year’s Eve, killing six people, including the chief executive of British catering giant Compass Group Plc. .Australian Transport Safety Bureau Executive Director Nat Nagy said investigators would probe several lines of inquiry to piece together what happened, including a close look at the plane’s avionics and maintenance record and the pilot’s background and experience. .It was hoped the plane would be raised by the end of the week, Nagy said. A crane, airbags, or a combination of the two, would be used to raise the plane from the riverbed as gently as possible. .The plane is submerged in 13 metres of water near Cowan, about 40 km (25 miles) north of Sydney. .Nagy said investigators would also look for any other electronic devices, including iPads or iPhones, that may have been on board when the plane crashed on Sunday, killing Compass chief executive Richard Cousins, 58, and four members of his family. The pilot, Gareth Morgan, 44, was also killed. .A preliminary report into the crash will be made public in about a month, although authorities have warned it may take up to a year to find out what happened. .“If we do identify any critical safety issues throughout the course of the investigation, we will immediately notify the relevant authorities … to remedy any issues,” Nagy said. .“This particular aircraft, I understand was manufactured in 1963, it’s not unusual to have aircraft of that sort of age flying around … we haven’t seen any systemic issues around this aircraft,” he added. .Australian police have identified those killed with Cousins as Emma Bowden, 48, Heather Bowden, 11, Edward Cousins, 23, and William Cousins, 25. .Family members and media reports identified four of the victims Cousins’ two sons, his fiancée and her daughter. .Cousins, who led Compass over the past 11 years, was due to step down in March after being widely credited with turning the company’s business around and making it into one of the Financial Times Stock Exchange’s best-performing firms. .The seaplane was part of the Sydney Seaplanes business that has operated since 2005 with no previous record of mishap.

{'input': 'January 2, 2018 / 11:24 AM / Updated 3 minutes ago Bulgarias president vetoes anti-corruption law Reuters Staff 3 Min Read .SOFIA (Reuters) - Bulgarian President Rumen Radev on Tuesday vetoed anti-graft legislation passed by parliament in December, saying the bill would not allow the efficient investigation of corruption networks. FILE PHOTO: Bulgarian President Rumen Radev addresses the 72nd United Nations General Assembly at U.N. headquarters in New York, U.S., September 20, 2017. REUTERS/Eduardo Munoz .Radev acted only a day after Bulgaria, the European Union’s poorest country, assumed the six-month, rotating presidency of the bloc. It is the first time the Balkan state has taken over the role since it joined the EU on Jan. 1, 2007. .Bulgaria has made scant progress towards stamping out graft and organised crime, and the European Commission, the EU’s executive, has repeatedly rebuked the Black Sea country for failing to prosecute and sentence allegedly corrupt officials. .According to Transparency International, Bulgaria is the EU’s most corrupt country. .The measures in the law, approved by the national assembly two weeks ago, included the creation of a special anti-graft unit, meant to investigate persons occupying high state posts as well as assets and conflict of interest. .“I believe that the adopted law not only does not create an adequate legal basis for tackling corruption but will even make it difficult to fight it,” Radev, who won a presidential election in November 2016, said in a statement. .Bulgaria’s president is chosen by popular vote. .Analysts have also voiced concern that the bill was not fit for purpose as the new unit, whose management would be appointed by parliament, may not be truly independent and could be used by those in power to persecute opponents. .“No doubt, the president has strong arguments (to veto the law),” political analyst Petar Cholakov said. Analysts, however, expect the parliament to overturn Radev’s veto. .The new law also focuses on improving control and accountability of law-enforcement agencies, and the government in Sofia is hoping that Bulgaria will be able to change opinions and remove its tarnished image during its EU presidency. .Corruption has deterred foreign investment since communism collapsed in Bulgaria in 1989, and the EU has kept Sofia as well as neighbouring Romania - for the same rule-of-law failings - outside its Schengen zone of passport-free travel.

{'input': '* European stocks rise * Next drives retail sector up after strong Christmas update * Tech stocks, industrials make gains * MiFID II reforms, U.S. Fed FOMC minutes in focus Jan 3 (Reuters) - Welcome to the home for real time coverage of European equity markets brought to you by Reuters stocks reporters and anchored today by Kit Rees. Reach her on Messenger to share your thoughts on market moves: kit.rees.thomsonreuters.com@reuters.net 2017 sees record number of deals worldwide (1435 GMT) Deal making is another theme investors are considering at the beginning of the year, and whether the M&A wagon will continue to roll on in 2018. Last year was another blockbuster year: the number of worldwide deals hit a record in 2017, totaling $3.6 trillion, according to Thomson Reuters data. This was also the fourth year in a row where M&A activity surpassed $3 trillion. Interestingly while European M&A was up 17 percent in 2017, the U.S. saw a decline of 16 percent in the value of deals. Perhaps this is testament to the strength of the European economy, or the fact that debt has been so cheap? Heres a graphic from our Deals Intelligence colleagues: (Kit Rees) ** Gnawing on the bone of European equities: enjoy it while it lasts (1339 GMT) SocGen has repeatedly warned its clients that European equities are close to their historical averages in terms of valuation. Its message today is that there is not much meat on the bone left, even if todays traders seem to be in a clear risk-on mood. Strategists reckon exit strategies will do better this year as central banks start to turn the taps of stimulus off, and recommend holding sovereign bonds over equities. Be ready for the end of Goldilocks, strategists warn. Here are SocGens top tips : (Helen Reid and Julien Ponthus) Lunchtime Update: European stocks hold in positive territory (1325 GMT) As we cruise into afternoon trading, European stocks remain positive, with tech the top-gaining sector. Over in the U.S. stocks futures are pointing to Wall St also opening higher, following the S&P 500s record close. Heres your European equity market snapshot: (Kit Rees) Shorting UK retailers, theres your thriller! (1222 GMT) While the first MIFID II trading day is not the action movie some had expected, the return to favour today of the UK retail sector is likely to be a real thriller (and not in a good way) for those short sellers who are betting on its downfall. Data from Astec Short Interest compiled by Helen shows that the amount of Next shares on loan surged in a year, from 2.3 million last January to 4.3 million yesterday. The cost to borrow also rose, indicating demand to short the shares increased. No doubt many of those short sellers are feeling the squeeze today and exiting their trades, helping the stock rise. Next, which had a horrible start in 2017, losing over 17 percent on Jan 4, is currently leading the FTSE with a 7 percent jump, lifting the sector with the likes of Primark owner Associated British Foods. Alasdair has an additional interesting fact for you : out of the 10 most shorted British stocks, 5 are from the retail sector: Debenhams, Ocado, WM Morrison, Marks & Spencer and Sainsbury. (Julien Ponthus and Helen Reid) ** Buy-side traders say MiFID II could make it harder to access quality liquidity -survey (1120 GMT) Although the wide-ranging new regulations dont seem to be making huge ripples in trading immediately, some buy-side traders think it could make their jobs more difficult, a survey by trading platform ITG found. While 45 percent of respondents thought MiFID II would have no significant impact on their ability to access quality liquidity, 37 percent said it would become harder. Thats nearly twice the 18 percent who saw the regulation actually helping traders find liquidity. Of course what makes liquidity quality could be subjective, but MiFID IIs clampdown on dark pools certainly takes some of the options off the table for traders. The survey also revealed some interesting patterns in the types of venues traders are more likely to transact in post-MiFID. Traditional lit markets were by far the most popular, while traders were more likely to shun electronic market maker and bank SIs. As many traders have been telling us this morning, itll take a little more adaptation time before we can see for sure who the MiFID winners and losers are. (Helen Reid) ** If MIFID II were a movie, it wouldnt be a thriller (1100 GMT) While there has been some kind of excitement ahead of the implementation today of MIFID II rules, the feedback were getting from trading floors across the markets is, well, not that exciting at all. At 1125, Paris time, after more than two hours of trading, there is nothing in particular to report, a major asset manager told us. There is, according to Thomson Reuters data, a drop in activity. Our correspondent Alasdair Pal, who dug the data, reports volumes on the STOXX 600 were down by around 25 percent in the first hour of Wednesday compared with a day previously. Against the first hour of trading on Jan 3 2017, volumes were down by 11 percent. Antoine Lesne, head of SPDR ETF Strategy for EMEA at State Street, told Helen that was to be expected. We clearly expect a slightly slower take-off as people are testing the pipes and so on. The expectation is that it (trading) will be slower but I am not sure. It was very slow yesterday as well so I wouldn’t say it’s because of MiFID only. Maybe City A.M.s spooky front page was a bit over the top: (Julien Ponthus) Dark pool migration drives December volumes for exchanges -UBS (1022 GMT) On the topic of MiFID II, UBS analysts made an interesting observation about the market share gains traditional European exchanges enjoyed in December 2017: We believe the December gains to market share were driven by a migration of volume away from dark venues as the market prepares for the implementation of the Double Volume Caps under MiFID II (starting today). Euronext is UBS top pick and they also rate Deutsche Boerse a buy, while LSE and Flow Traders are neutral and BME is a sell. (Kit Rees) ** European stocks hold on to gains, FTSE muted (1002 GMT) While the STOXX 600 is off its early highs, its still in positive territory as industrials, health stocks and retailers drive gains, though its pretty quiet just after the festive season. The FTSE 100 is the laggard, flat even though sterling has given up its gains following a disappointing construction PMI. Financials are taking the most points off the FTSE, followed by consumer staples. Heres your mid-morning market snapshot: (Kit Rees) ** Stronger start for European equities (0817) Its a decidedly stronger open across the European benchmarks this morning with Next leading the way on the STOXX 600, up 7.5 percent after its Christmas sales beat. Marks & Spencer is rising as well as concerns around the ailing retail sector are placated somewhat by Nexts update.

{'input': 'January 3, 2018 / 12:20 PM / Updated 2 hours ago Parties optimistic as matchmaker Merkel plans SPD coalition re-run Madeline Chambers , Thorsten Severin 4 Min Read .BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany’s largest parties expressed optimism about the chances of forming a government after several hours of talks between the leaders of Chancellor Angela Merkel’s conservatives and the Social Democrats (SPD) she hopes to win as coalition partners. .Wednesday’s joint statement from the parties, which talked of growing confidence, was good news for Merkel, whose reputation as Europe’s consummate consensus-builder is on the line in this second bid to form a coalition government after weeks of sniping between its would-be partners. .Seeking a fourth term in office, Merkel saw her authority weakened in a national election in September, when support for her conservatives was eroded by the far right. .“Confidence has grown and we are optimistic heading into the talks,” read the joint statement, issued after three hours of talks between Merkel and other leaders of her Christian Democrats (CDU), her Bavarian CSU allies and the SPD. .She is under pressure to reach a deal with the centre-left Social Democrats (SPD), which also lost ground in the election, but the two sides have bickered over a range of issues, notably immigration and taxation. .SPD leader Martin Schulz praised the “concentrated, focused consultations” he had had with leaders, which he said were a good basis for formal exploratory talks. The discussions are due to start on Sunday and could lead to official coalition negotiations in a few weeks. .Having failed before Christmas to form a coalition with the Greens and pro-business Free Democrats (FDP), Merkel is now leading an interim government with the SPD that is keeping things ticking over in Europe’s biggest economy. .Merkel’s CDU/CSU alliance ruled in a ‘grand coalition’ with the SPD from 2013 to 2017 and, with investors fearing a protracted power vacuum that could delay reforms in Germany and the European Union, she is pressing for a re-run of that arrangement. .But the SPD has shown reluctance, with some of its members favoring a looser cooperation agreement or supporting a minority government. German acting Chancellor Angela Merkel poses for photographs after the television recording of her annual New Years speech at the Chancellery in Berlin, Germany, December 30, 2017. REUTERS/Hannibal Hanschke .‘VERBAL SHENANIGANS’ .The two blocs are at odds on issues from healthcare and immigration to Europe and pensions and, if no deal is done, Merkel’s future as chancellor would be thrown into doubt with new elections a distinct prospect. .In recent days some conservatives, especially from Bavaria, have stoked tensions by calling for tax cuts for high earners and reductions in benefits for asylum seekers, which the SPD opposes. .“Again verbal shenanigans from the Bavarian CSU,” tweeted one of the SPD’s deputy leaders, Ralf Stegner. .“Always the same recipe: humour the lederhosen public. No sense of reality in terms of agreeing with the other parties.” .But CSU leader Horst Seehofer sounded more conciliatory on Wednesday, saying “important days” lay ahead. “We will do everything in these talks to reach sensible agreements,” said the Bavarian before internal party talks on Wednesday morning. .One of Merkel’s priorities will be to establish an atmosphere of trust between the parties, the absence of which led to the collapse of the talks with the Greens and FDP in November. .Many within the SPD fear sharing power with Merkel again will lead voters to punish it further. The SPD had said it would go into opposition after the election in which its support slumped to its lowest level since 1933. .To keep the rank and file on board, the SPD leadership has said it will let its members vote on Jan 21 on going ahead with detailed coalition talks after a first exploratory phase has been completed. .“I have said that (a coalition deal) must be agreed at the very latest by Easter,” said Seehofer.

Published 6 Hours Ago Getty Images Donald Trump .Pakistan summoned the U.S. ambassador in protest against U.S. President Donald Trumps angry tweet about Pakistans lies and deceit, while Foreign Minister Khawaja Asif dismissed the outburst as a political stunt. .David Hale was summoned by the Pakistan foreign office on Monday to explain Trumps tweet, media said. A spokesperson for the U.S. Embassy in Islamabad confirmed the meeting took place. .In a withering attack, Trump on Monday said the United States had foolishly handed Pakistan more than $33 billion in aid in the last 15 years and had been rewarded with nothing but lies and deceit. .They give safe haven to the terrorists we hunt in Afghanistan , with little help. No more! Trump wrote on Twitter. Trump tweet .Trumps harsh words drew praise from Pakistans old foe, India , and neighboring Afghanistan, but long-time ally China defended Pakistans record of combating terrorism. .Pakistan Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi on Tuesday will chair a cabinet meeting that will focus on Trumps tweet, while on Wednesday the countrys top civilian and military chiefs will meet to discuss deteriorating U.S. ties. .Relations between the United States and its uneasy ally Pakistan have been strained for many years over Islamabads alleged support for Haqqani network militants, who are allied with the Afghan Taliban. .The United States also alleges senior Afghan Taliban commanders live on Pakistani soil. In 2016, the then-Taliban leader Mullah Mansour was killed by a U.S. drone strike inside Pakistan and in 2011, al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden was found and killed by U.S. troops in the Pakistani garrison town of Abbottabad. .Washington has signaled to Pakistan that it will cut aid and enact other punitive measures if Islamabad does not stop helping or turning a blind eye to the Haqqani network militants who carry out cross-border attacks in Afghanistan. .Islamabad bristles at the suggestion it is not doing enough in the war against militancy, saying that since 2001, Pakistan has suffered more than the United States from militancy as casualties at the hands of Islamists number in the tens of thousands. .Pakistani Foreign Minister Asif dismissed Trumps comments as a political stunt borne out of frustration over U.S. failures in Afghanistan, where Afghan Taliban militants have been gaining territory and carrying out major attacks. .He has tweeted against us (Pakistan) and Iran for his domestic consumption, Asif told Geo TV on Monday. .He is again and again displacing his frustrations on Pakistan over failures in Afghanistan as they are trapped in dead-end street in Afghanistan. .Asif added that Pakistan did not need U.S. aid. .A U.S. National Security Council official on Monday said the White House did not plan to send $255 million in aid to Pakistan at this time and said the administration continues to review Pakistans level of cooperation. In August, the administration had said it was delaying the payment. .Afghan and Indian officials applauded Trumps abrasive comments. .His Excellency President Trump has declared the reality. Pakistan has never helped or participated in tackling terrorism, General Dawlat Waziri, spokesman for the Afghan Ministry of Defence, told Reuters. .Jitendra Singh, a junior minister at the Indian Prime Ministers Office, said Trumps posturing has vindicated Indias stand as far as terror is concerned and as far as Pakistans role in perpetrating terrorism is concerned. .But China gave Pakistan its backing.

{'input': 'LEAWOOD, Kan.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Tallgrass Energy Partners, LP (NYSE: TEP) today announced two strategic acquisitions by its Tallgrass Terminals business and several significant commercial developments that continue to expand the variety of services offered by Pony Express in key crude oil producing basins it serves..“Today’s announcements, along with last week’s news of the five-year contract extension with Pony Express’ largest customer, continue to solidify Pony Express’ track record as a reliable and diverse pipeline and strengthens its ability to serve crude oil markets for decades to come,” said David G. Dehaemers Jr., Tallgrass Energy President and Chief Executive Officer. With news of increasing crude oil production in basins Pony Express serves, we’re even more confident that utilization of our pipeline will continue to increase in the future.”.Tallgrass Terminals Strategic Acquisitions.Pawnee Terminal.Tallgrass Terminals, LLC (“Tallgrass Terminals”) has entered into an agreement to acquire a 51 percent membership interest in the Pawnee, Colo. crude oil terminal (“Pawnee Terminal”) from Zenith Energy for approximately $31 million. The Pawnee Terminal is an injection point for the Tallgrass Pony Express Northeast Colorado Lateral (“NECL”), with 300,000 barrels of storage and backed by minimum volume commitments of approximately 90,000 barrels per day. The Pawnee Terminal will provide commercial and operational synergies with Pony Express and offers the potential for incremental sourcing opportunities such as directly connecting nearby producers. Tallgrass Terminals expects the transaction to close in Q1 2018, subject to certain closing conditions..Deeprock Development Expansion.In addition, Tallgrass Terminals has acquired a 38 percent interest in Deeprock North, LLC (Deeprock North), which owns a crude oil terminal in North Cushing, Okla., immediately adjacent to the Deeprock Development, LLC (Deeprock Development) crude oil terminal facility. The purchase price for the interest was $19.5 million or approximately eight times current cash flow. Immediately following the acquisition, Deeprock North was merged into Deeprock Development. After the acquisition and merger, Deeprock Development now owns a larger and more diverse terminalling complex with total storage capacity of 4.0 million barrels. Tallgrass Terminals owns approximately 60 percent of the combined entity and retains significant strategic and commercial control. Tallgrass expects the acquisition to enhance and expand Tallgrass Terminals’ commercial offerings for both Pony Express customers and other customers in Cushing..Pony Express Commercial Updates and Developments.Successful Platteville Extension Open Season.Pony Express recently concluded a successful binding open season to secure committed shipper contracts for crude oil transportation of a new common stream on the Platteville Extension. The open season resulted in additional unaffiliated third-party commitments of 10,000 barrels per day for a total of 37,500 barrels per day of short-haul and long-haul binding transportation commitments. The 55-mile Platteville Extension is approximately 60 percent complete and expected to begin operations in April 2018, with the associated Grasslands Terminal expected to be in service in Q4 2018. The initial capacity of the Platteville Extension will be approximately 40,000 barrels per day, increasing to approximately 80,000 barrels per day once the Grasslands Terminal is in service..Record Volume Throughput Expected in January 2018.In late December 2017, Pony Express shippers nominated more than 10 million barrels, or approximately 325,000 barrels per day for movements in January 2018. If realized, this would constitute the largest per-day average during a single month in Pony Express history. Tallgrass affiliates account for only about 5 percent of the nominated volumes..January 2018 In-Service of Two New Refinery Connections Expected.Construction on the Holly Frontier El Dorado and CHS McPherson, Kan. refinery connections is complete, with line fill and commercial service expected in early January 2018 for both..Once the two new refinery connections are in service, Pony Express shippers will be able to deliver more than 300,000 barrels per day to three significant refineries directly connected to Pony Express, including the currently connected refinery in Ponca City, Okla..New Supply Connection.As previously announced, Tallgrass Terminals has a signed, 10-year take-or-pay agreement for 8,000 barrels per day from a new customer to support the construction of a terminal in the Central Kansas Uplift. Construction of the terminal is progressing on schedule, with completion and in-service expected by March 2018. Upon completion, the terminalling facilities will have delivery capabilities of approximately 20,000 barrels per day into the Pony Express mainline, providing the opportunity to accommodate incremental volumes from the Central Kansas Uplift..Upon completion of these projects, Pony Express will have six different supply sources and five different crude oil streams capable of being batched on the system..“We believe the execution of our organically developed commercial projects by Pony Express and Tallgrass Terminals and the expansion of Tallgrass Terminals’ complimentary service offerings through acquisition continue to demonstrate that Pony Express is the most attractive, diverse and capable crude oil transportation and logistics system in the regions in which it operates,” said Matt Sheehy, Tallgrass Energy Chief Commercial Officer. “Diversity of supply and delivery points, multiple batch shipment capability, readily available expansion capacity and an attractive tariff rate solidify Pony Express as a critical part of the country’s crude oil midstream infrastructure.”.About Tallgrass Energy.Tallgrass Energy is a family of companies that includes publicly traded partnerships Tallgrass Energy Partners, LP (NYSE: TEP) and Tallgrass Energy GP, LP (NYSE: TEGP), and privately held Tallgrass Development, LP.

{'input': 'Amazons New Headquarters: Atlanta and Austin Lead Odds to Start 2018 Barry Williams Getty Images Jeff John Roberts January 2, 2018 .Amazon will make a big splash in 2018 by announcing the location of its second corporate headquarters—a prize expected to bring prestige and as many as 50,000 high paying jobs to the winning city. .When cities submitted their bids in late October, Fortune turned to a popular betting site to see which of the more than 200 candidates had the early edge. Fast forward to the new year, and the initial favorite —Atlanta—is still at the top of the list, but its chances have declined from 2/1 to 3/1 and it now shares the perch with Southern rival, Austin, Tex. .Here is a screenshot of the latest odds, pulled from PaddyPower, an Irish betting site that lets people put their money where their mouth is on everything from sports to world events: Fortune .As you can see by comparing the above list to the original odds below, there have been a number of other developments in the race to attract Amazon . These include a larger list of contenders to bet on (from 13 to 23), and a slight improvement in the outlook for the cities of Philadelphia and Washington, DC. Fortune .Here are some other developments worth noting: Chicago and Denver, which represents two notable omissions from the first list, and are now there but are marked as relative long shots (16/1 and 20/1) Boston, which is regularly mentioned as one of the favorites, is still hanging tough but has fallen slightly from 6/1 to 7/1 The prospects for Toronto have dimmed significantly, from 7/1 to 16/1. .Overall, the three leading candidates—Atlanta, Austin and Boston—are not a surprise since they all possess many criteria Amazon is seeking, including a tech savvy workforce and urban amenities. Moreover, their location may prove an advantage since most people think it’s unlikely Amazon will add a second headquarters on the west coast. .WATCH: The Best-Selling Grits on Amazon Come from This Tiny Southern Town .Get Data Sheet , Fortune’s technology newsletter. .Meanwhile, the chances of Toronto or any other non-American city seem far-fetched since it would give President Trump, who has already been assailing Amazon, an excuse to pummel the company for a lack of patriotism. .Finally, while there has been little in the way of leaks during the process, the city of Atlanta may take encouragement from reports that Amazon recently engaged a lobbyist there. .Sites like PaddyPower (which does not accept bets from Americans) may seem frivolous to some, but many economists view them as valuable “ prediction markets ,” which provide insight into real world outcomes.

{'input': 'Natural gas futures, dipping on a warmer long term forecast, are likely to spike again after freezing weather takes another big bite out of gas supplies later this week..The normally very abundant supply of U.S. natural gas could be put to the test this season and could actually see some spot shortages by the end of winter, according to analysts. An unexpectedly harsh cold snap across North America resulted in record gas demand New Years Day, while at the same time natural gas producers from Pennsylvania to North Dakota are being forced to shut in some production at the well head due to the cold temperatures..We could consume upwards of a quarter of the stored natural gas just this month, said John Kilduff, energy analyst with Again Capital. The Energy Information Administration releases weekly data Thursday, and Kilduff said hes looking for a draw down of 225 billion cubic feet, more than double the normal level for this time of year..Things could start to get tight for sure. Even if we have a normally cold winter, things get tight, he said. These are big demand numbers were seeing. Monday was a record. I think Saturday could eclipse Mondays record. Analysts said about 143 billion cubic feet of gas was consumed Monday, the largest on any one day in four years..The U.S. is the biggest natural gas producer in the world, and analysts see no chance that supplies will run out or be unavailable but a shortage could mean prices will be higher. .The unexpected cold spell across North America is now being compounded by a massive winter storm, dubbed a bomb cyclone, that is expected to create blizzard conditions in parts of New England, and potentially dump more than a foot of snow..The storm is expected to run up the east coast, creating huge surf and high winds and bringing an even colder wave of frigid temperatures to a third of the eastern half of the U.S. by the weekend. Freezing rain or snow is expected from Florida to Canada..Natural gas futures Wednesday were down 2.2 percent to $2.98 per million British Thermal Units, off a high of $3.10 per mBtus Tuesday..Overnight we saw warming trends in the 12-to-15 day forecast and the 16-to-21 day, said Bespoke Weather chief weather analyst Jacob Meisel. Were still expecting what could be a record drawdown next Thursday by the EIA for the week ending this Friday. That would include the three day holiday weekend for New Years..Meisel said the futures market is now expecting natural gas storage to be 1.265 trillion cubic feet by the end of winter, compared to the five-year average of 1.7 trillion cubic feet..What the market is focusing on right now is the comparison to the five year average, and were going to walk into the spring season with stockpiles below the five year average. The question is whether were able to produce our way out of the problem, he said. Im confident in saying were basically walking into spring, 2018 with a shortage of gas..That means gas prices could be higher. In the cash market Wednesday, prices have been volatile, and Meisel said Henry Hub cash have been volatile and hit a high over $7 Wednesday. .If there was some sustained cold through the winter, we could see draw downs as low as 1,000 bcfs, Meisel said. Right now were just trying to figure out this warm up. We are having one more cold shot that will be focused Jan. 12 to 14, that spooked the market a little bit [Tuesday. There are concerns cold could stick around a little longer than anticipated. Thats what would get the market going if the warmer weather were expecting isnt ending up verifying..S&P Global Platts analysts said they believe the potential for supply shortages is in fact, limited by the rapid production. Indeed the notion of just in time shale production is going to change the way market prices during the peak period for winter demand, they noted, adding that New England is a market where consumers high prices due to insiffucient investment in midstream delivery and therefore pay high prices during peak demand..Meisel said its possible colder weather could return by the end of January or early February . The forecast at this point is highly uncertain, he said..Even so, the weather has already been historic. The city of Boston tied its own 100-year-old record on Tuesday when it experienced seven consecutive days of temperatures that did not top 20 degrees Fahrenheit. Temperatures were expected to be in the mid 20s degress Fahrenheit Wednesday.', 'output': "[['Natural Gas Futures', 'FIN_INSTRUMENT', 'Dip', 'US Natural Gas', 'ECON_INDICATOR'], ['US Natural Gas', 'ECON_INDICATOR', 'Operate_In', 'North America', 'GPE'], ['Analysts', 'PERSON', 'Predict', 'Spot Shortages', 'ECON_INDICATOR'], ['Analysts', 'PERSON', 'Relate_To', 'Harsh Cold Snap', 'CONCEPT'], ['Natural Gas Producers', 'ORG', 'Forced', 'Shut In', 'Production'], ['John Kilduff', 'PERSON', 'Estimate', 'Draw Down', '225 billion cubic feet', 'ECON_INDICATOR'], ['EIA', 'ORG', 'Release', 'Weekly Data', 'Thursday'], ['Analysts', 'PERSON', 'Expect', 'Tight', 'Supply'], ['Analysts', 'PERSON', 'See', 'No Chance', 'Supplies', 'Run Out'], ['Bomb Cyclone', 'EVENT', 'Compound', 'Cold Spell', 'CONCEPT'], ['Bomb Cyclone', 'EVENT', 'Create', 'Blizzard Conditions', 'CONCEPT'], ['Bomb Cyclone', 'EVENT', 'Dubbed', 'Massive Winter Storm', 'CONCEPT'], ['Natural Gas Futures', 'FIN_INSTRUMENT', 'Down', '2.2 Percent', 'ECON_INDICATOR'], ['Bespoke Weather', 'ORG', 'Expect', 'Record Drawdown', 'Next Thursday'], ['Bespoke Weather', 'ORG', 'Expect', 'What Could Be', 'Record Drawdown', 'Next Thursday'], ['Bespoke Weather', 'ORG', 'Expect', 'Storage To Be', '1.265 Trillion Cubic Feet', 'ECON_INDICATOR'], ['Bespoke Weather', 'ORG', 'Confident', 'Walk Into Spring', '2018', 'WITH', 'Shortage Of Gas'], ['Henry Hub Cash', 'FIN_INSTRUMENT', 'Volatile', 'Hit A High Over $7', 'ECON_INDICATOR'], ['S&P Global Platts', 'ORG', 'Analysts', 'Believe', 'Supply Shortages', 'Limited'], ['S&P Global Platts', 'ORG', 'Analysts', 'Note', 'Notion Of', 'Just In Time', 'Shale Production'], ['New England', 'GPE', 'Market', 'Where Consumers', 'Pay High Prices', 'Due To Insufficient Investment', 'Midstream Delivery'], ['Meisel', 'PERSON', 'Say', 'Possible', 'Colder Weather', 'Return', 'By End Of January', 'OR', 'Early February'], ['Meisel', 'PERSON', 'Say', 'Forecast', 'Highly Uncertain'], ['Boston', 'GPE', 'Tie', '100-Year-Old Record', 'Seven Consecutive Days', 'Temperature', 'Does Not Top 20 Degrees Fahrenheit', 'CONCEPT'], ['Temperature', 'CONCEPT', 'Expected', 'Mid 20s Degrees Fahrenheit', 'Wednesday']]", 'category': 'closed_qa'}

The op-ed, titled The Republicans Fake Investigations, is the first in-depth account given by the firms founders, Glenn R. Simpson and Peter Fritsch, outside of a courtroom or a private committee hearing. Getty Images Donald Trump .The founders of Fusion GPS, the research firm behind the Steele dossier, said that congressional Republicans are chasing rabbits in an op-ed published Tuesday in The New York Times. .The op-ed, titled The Republicans Fake Investigations, is the first in-depth account given by the Fusion GPS founders, Glenn R. Simpson and Peter Fritsch, outside of a courtroom or a private committee hearing. The intelligence committees have known for months that credible allegations of collusion between the Trump camp and Russia were pouring in from independent sources during the campaign, Simpson and Fritsch wrote. Yet lawmakers in the thrall of the president continue to wage a cynical campaign to portray us as the unwitting victims of Kremlin disinformation.The two former journalists wrote that they have toppled the far rights conspiracy theories and that they did not believe their firms dossier was the trigger for the FBIs investigation into alleged collusion between the Trump camp and Russia. Fusion GPS hired former British spy Christopher Steele to conduct research on Donald Trump s possible connections to Russia during the 2016 presidential campaign. That research — compiled in a series of memos referred to as the Steele dossier — has inflamed Republicans who contend the unverified reports were the basis of the federal investigation into Trumps campaign. The op-ed follows a report published in the Times on Saturday that confirmed that the dossier was not the cause of the FBI inquiry now being headed by special counsel Robert Mueller . Lawmakers on the House Intelligence Committee are fighting Fusion GPS in court to acquire the companys bank records. In filings with the U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., attorneys for the committee have argued that Fusion GPS has sought to keep records from the committee that are relevant to its investigation. Fusion GPS has argued the records the intelligence panel is looking for are not pertinent to its investigation. In their op-ed, Simpson and Fritsch accuse the committee of going on a fishing expedition for the records of companies we work for that have nothing to do with the Trump case. .Thomas Hungar, general counsel of the House of Representatives, did not respond to a request for comment from CNBC. The writers, who note that their firm provided 21 hours of testimony to congressional committees, called on Congress to release the transcripts of their testimony so that the American people can learn the truth about our work. .Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, said his panel has provided Fusion GPS with multiple opportunities for transparency. Senator Grassley provided Fusion GPS an opportunity for transparency six months ago when he invited the firm to publicly testify at an open committee hearing. Mr. Simpson declined. When faced with a subpoena from the Chairman and Ranking Member, Mr. Simpson refused to provide public testimony, Grassleys office wrote in a statement provided to NBC News. Despite his public statements, Mr. Simpson and his attorney demanded during the interview that the transcript be kept confidential. .The Committees invitation for Mr. Simpson to testify at a public hearing remains on the table, the statement said. .A spokesperson for Fusion GPS did not respond to a request for comment from CNBC.', 'output': "[['Fusion GPS', 'ORG', 'Found', 'Simpson', 'PERSON'], ['Fusion GPS', 'ORG', 'Found', 'Fritsch', 'PERSON'], ['Fusion GPS', 'ORG', 'Introduce', 'Steele Dossier', 'PRODUCT'], ['Republicans', 'ORG/GOV', 'Chase', 'Rabbits', 'CONCEPT'], ['Fusion GPS', 'ORG', 'Write', 'Op-ed', 'PRODUCT'], ['Fusion GPS', 'ORG', 'Write', 'First Account', 'CONCEPT'], ['Simpson', 'PERSON', 'Write', 'Op-ed', 'PRODUCT'], ['Fritsch', 'PERSON', 'Write', 'Op-ed', 'PRODUCT'], ['Fusion GPS', 'ORG', 'Topple', 'Conspiracy Theories', 'CONCEPT'], ['FBI', 'ORG/GOV', 'Investigate', 'Trump Camp', 'COMP'], ['Trump Camp', 'COMP', 'Collude', 'Russia', 'GPE'], ['Fusion GPS', 'ORG', 'Hire', 'Steele', 'PERSON'], ['Steele', 'PERSON', 'Research', 'Trump Connections', 'CONCEPT'], ['Steele Dossier', 'PRODUCT', 'Inflame', 'Republicans', 'ORG/GOV'], ['Dossier', 'PRODUCT', 'Basis', 'FBI Inquiry', 'CONCEPT'], ['House Intelligence Committee', 'ORG/GOV', 'Fight', 'Fusion GPS', 'ORG'], ['Fusion GPS', 'ORG', 'Argue', 'Records', 'CONCEPT'], ['Fusion GPS', 'ORG', 'Argue', 'Records', 'CONCEPT'], ['Fusion GPS', 'ORG', 'Argue', 'Not Pertinent', 'CONCEPT'], ['Committee', 'ORG/GOV', 'Look', 'Records', 'CONCEPT'], ['Fusion GPS', 'ORG', 'Accuse', 'Committee', 'ORG/GOV'], ['Committee', 'ORG/GOV', 'Go', 'Fishing Expedition', 'CONCEPT'], ['Fusion GPS', 'ORG', 'Provide', 'Testimony', 'CONCEPT'], ['Fusion GPS', 'ORG', 'Provide', 'Testimony', 'CONCEPT'], ['Grassley', 'PERSON', 'Provide', 'Opportunity', 'CONCEPT'], ['Fusion GPS', 'ORG', 'Decline', 'Public Testimony', 'CONCEPT'], ['Fusion GPS', 'ORG', 'Refuse', 'Provide Public Testimony', 'CONCEPT'], ['Fusion GPS', 'ORG', 'Demand', 'Transcript Confidential', 'CONCEPT'], ['Committee', 'ORG/GOV', 'Invitation', 'Testify', 'CONCEPT'], ['Fusion GPS', 'ORG', 'Remain', 'Table', 'CONCEPT']]", 'category': 'closed_qa'}
{'input': 'Southwest and American airlines to pay bonuses after tax bill Airlines are sharing some of their tax-law windfall with employees and Boeing. American and Southwest said they will pay employees bonuses of $1,000 each. Published 5 Hours Ago 22 Mins Ago | 00:40 .Airlines are sharing some of their tax-law windfall with employees and Boeing , the big aircraft maker. .American and Southwest said Tuesday that they will pay employees bonuses of $1,000 each, a gesture that American said would cost $130 million. .Southwest also said that it exercised options to buy more new jets from Boeing while delaying orders for some others. .Unlike most other U.S. airlines, Dallas-based Southwest has long been profitable and already pays cash income taxes. It earned $1.6 billion in the first nine months of 2017, and will benefit immediately from the lower rate on corporate income in the tax bill that President Donald Trump signed last month. .Southwest said it expects to record a non-cash credit of between $1 billion and $1.5 billion in the fourth quarter to reflect the difference in rates between the time the tax expenses were accrued and when they will be paid. .Because of huge losses in previous years, other major U.S. carriers do not pay cash income taxes even though they have become hugely profitable. American, for instance, earned $1.7 billion in the first nine months of last year. All the airlines should benefit, however, from a provision in the new law that lets businesses more quickly depreciate the cost of investments — aircraft, in their case. .CEO Doug Parker and President Robert Isom said the new tax law will help American in the long run, presumably when it can no longer avoid income taxes by counting past losses. They said the tax changes will give the company more confidence to invest in planes and facilities and pay the employee bonuses. .American said employees at the main airline and its regional affiliates would get their money in the first quarter. Southwest said it will make payments next Monday. .Southwest also announced that it would exercise options on 40 Boeing 737 jets valued at $4.5 billion while delaying 23 previous orders with a sticker price of $2.1 billion by up to five years. Southwest did not disclose financial terms, but airlines routinely get large discounts from list prices. .Southwest also said that it will donate an extra $5 million to charities in 2018. A spokesman for the company said it paid out more than $25 million in cash, free tickets and other donations to charity in 2016, the last year for which final figures are available. .In a regulatory filing, Southwest also said it expects to record $105 million in fourth-quarter expenses because of the moves announced Tuesday and other items, including a legal settlement, which it did not describe. The result will be an increase of about 3.5 percentage points in the companys forecast of so-called unit expenses — the amount per seat that it costs to fly one mile.

Palestinian teen Ahed Tamimi (R) enters a military courtroom escorted by Israeli Prison Service personnel at Ofer Prison, near the West Bank city of Ramallah, January 1, 2018. REUTERS/Ammar Awad .Justifying the ban, authorities in the Southeast Asian city state said the film “Radiance of Resistance” was “skewed” and potentially divisive for Singapore’s multi-ethnic population. .The documentary, which looks at the Palestine-Israeli conflict through the eyes of 16-year-old Ahed Tamimi and another young female activist, lacked “counterbalance”, the Info-communications Media Development Authority of Singapore (IMDA) said on its website. .“The skewed narrative of the film is inflammatory and has the potential to cause disharmony amongst the different races and religions in Singapore,” the IMDA said. .The documentary was due to have been shown at the Singapore Palestinian Film Festival on Thursday. .It was screened at a number of festivals worldwide in 2017 and won Best Documentary at the Respect Human Rights Film Festival in Belfast, but has become even more topical following Tamimi’s arrest last month. .Tamimi was charged on Monday with counts of aggravated assault and will be tried in an Israeli military court.

LOCAL MARKETS OUTLOOK (As reported by NewsRise) The SGX Nifty Futures was trading at 10,473.00, trading up 0.05 percent from its previous close The Indian rupee will likely edge steady to higher against the dollar in early trade, tracking overnight losses in the greenback, as the euro hovered near a three-year high on positive investor sentiment over Eurozones economic outlook. Indian government bonds are expected to edge lower, tracking a rise in U.S. Treasury yields and firm crude oil prices that make emerging market debt less attractive for investors. The yield on the benchmark 6.79 percent bond maturing in 2027 is likely to trade in a 7.36 percent-7.40 percent band today, a trader with a primary dealership said. The bond closed at 96.02 rupees, yielding 7.38 percent, yesterday. GLOBAL MARKETS • U.S. stocks rose in the first session of the new year and the Nasdaq closed above 7,000 for the first time on Tuesday as investors were optimistic that 2018 will bring more gains for the market. • Asian stocks struck a fresh decade high as risk appetites were whetted by a bevy of upbeat manufacturing surveys that confirmed a synchronised upturn in world growth was well under way. • The euro traded within sight of its highest level in three years on Wednesday, underpinned by optimism about the euro zones economic outlook. • U.S. Treasury yields rose on Tuesday on strong Wall Street gains and in line with European government yields after a European Central Bank official said the ECBs massive bond purchase program may not be continued later this year. • Oil prices were stable, not far off mid-2015 highs reached the previous session, as strong demand and ongoing efforts led by OPEC and Russia to curb production tightened the market. • Gold prices edged up, hitting over 3-1/2-month highs, driven by a softer dollar.

It gained further support from the Fed’s latest minutes, which indicated the central bank is still poised to raise interest rates several times this year..But by 0824 GMT on Thursday it was back in negative territory, with its index down 0.1 percent on the day..The euro had dipped in early trade in Asia, reaching $1.2005, but it then bounced back to trade at $1.2029, up 0.1 percent on the day..“We see some very positive euro sentiment in the market right now, and if it goes down too much against the U.S. dollar that’s going to begin again... The market is not confident enough right now that levels below $1.20 are justified,” said Commerzbank currency strategist Esther Reichelt in Frankfurt..“That might change with the U.S. employment data coming in strong,” she said, adding that U.S. wages numbers due on Friday could be key in determining the dollar’s direction..In the minutes from their Dec. 12-13 meeting, Fed policymakers acknowledged the U.S. labour market’s solid gains and the expansion in economic activity, even as they affirmed worries about persistently low inflation..That suggested the central bank will continue to pursue a gradual approach to raising rates but could hasten the pace if inflation accelerates..The U.S. currency was higher against the yen, trading up 0.2 percent at 112.655 yen on strong risk appetite across markets. It touched a 2-1/2-week low of 112.055 on Tuesday after declining steadily from a high above 113.750, scaled in December..Buoyed by overnight gains on Wall Street, Tokyo’s Nikkei began the first day of trading in 2018 by rallying 2.5 percent..Makoto Noji, senior strategist at SMBC Nikko Securities in Tokyo, expects dollar/yen to stay around 110 yen in the medium term..“Yen demand stemming from Japan’s current account surplus will be checked by yen selling pressure stemming from ‘risk-on’ generated by global economic growth,” he said. “Dollar/yen is likely to remain in range around 110 yen amid this tug-of-war.”.Bitcoin was down almost 5 percent on the Bitstamp exchange at around $14,430, having lost more than a quarter of its value since hitting record highs in mid-December.

It expected more frequent extreme events in future..We have a new normal, said Ernst Rauch, head of Munich Res Corporate Climate Centre, which monitors climate change risks..2017 was not an outlier, he said, noting insured losses have surpassed $100 billion multiple times since 2005. We must have on our radar the trend of new magnitudes..Last years hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria in the United States and Caribbean, wildfires in California and earthquakes in Mexico destroyed homes, infrastructure and numerous lives..The disasters also rocked global insurers. Munich Re and Hannover Re both issued profit warnings..That dealt a blow to a sector already struggling with thin margins, stiff competition and falling prices..Munich Res tally for the industry comes on the back of other estimates that underscored the severity of 2017..In December, Swiss Re estimated global insured losses from catastrophes would hit $136 billion in 2017, the third-highest on record for the sector, with the United States hardest hit. That figure is not directly comparable to Munich Res estimates as it includes man-made disasters..Reinsurers, which are in the business of insuring insurance, are experts in managing risk and rarely get caught off guard. Analysts have said reinsurers may need to take a fresh look at their risk models as the planet warms and storms become more intense..A big question for the industry has been whether the run of catastrophes would allow them to achieve higher prices for their coverage, which have been in decline for years..Early indications suggest modest increases. Global property reinsurance prices rose less than expected in the key Jan. 1 renewal season, with strong competition limiting increases to single digit percentages, brokers said this week..A turnaround in prices would be the first major reversal since Hurricane Katrina in 2005.

The whole business of Alpine is growing..“Downhill Alpine is still extreme,” added Prazmark, who has been involved in every Olympics since 1984 as a consultant and rights negotiator..That said, he was aware from his own family how the recreational landscape was changing..“I’ve got four kids. They run in ages from 34 to 21. My 21-year-old has never been on skis.

Aircraft come in to land and take off from Heathrow airport in London, Britain, October 30 2017. REUTERS/Toby Melville .Dutch aviation consulting firm To70 and the Aviation Safety Network both reported Monday there were no commercial passenger jet fatalities in 2017. “2017 was the safest year for aviation ever,” said Adrian Young of To70. .To70 estimated that the fatal accident rate for large commercial passenger flights is 0.06 per million flights, or one fatal accident for every 16 million flights. .The Aviation Safety Network also reported there were no commercial passenger jet deaths in 2017, but 10 fatal airliner accidents resulting in 44 fatalities onboard and 35 persons on the ground, including cargo planes and commercial passenger turbo prop aircraft. .That figure includes 12 people killed on Dec. 31 when a Nature Air Cessna 208B Grand Caravan aircraft crashed minutes after takeoff into a mountainous area off the beach town of Punta Islita, Costa Rica. .In comparison, there were 16 accidents and 303 deaths in 2016 among airliners. .The deadliest incident last year occurred in January when a Turkish cargo jet smashed into a village in Kyrgyzstan as it tried to land at a nearby airport in dense fog, killing 35 on the ground and all four onboard. .The Aviation Safety Network said 2017 was “the safest year ever, both by the number of fatal accidents as well as in terms of fatalities.” .Over the last two decades aviation deaths around the world have been steadily falling. As recently as 2005, there were 1,015 deaths aboard commercial passenger flights worldwide, the Aviation Safety Network said. .The United States last recorded a fatal airline passenger jet crash in February 2009, when Colgan Air Flight 3407 crashed short of the runway in Clarence Center, New York, killing 49 onboard and one person on the ground. .In 2016, 412 people were killed in the United States in aviation accidents - nearly all in general aviation accidents and none on commercial passenger airlines. .The last fatal passenger jet airliner accident worldwide took place in November 2016 near Medellin, Colombia and the last commercial passenger aircraft crash to kill more than 100 people occurred in October 2015 in Egypt.

{'input': 'January 2, 2018 / 10:11 AM / Updated an hour ago SE Asia Stocks-Singapore hits near 3-wk high on growth data Reuters Staff 3 Min Read .By Aditya Soni Jan 2 (Reuters) - Singapore shares climbed nearly 1 percent on Tuesday, buoyed by data showing the city-states economy grew last year at its fastest pace since 2014, while Indonesia reversed course to end lower after touching a record high. The Singapore index closed at its highest since Dec. 14, with financials leading the gainers. Index heavyweight DBS Group Holdings Ltd was up 1.4 percent, while Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp Ltd rose 0.8 percent. Todays data affirm that the recovery is broadening out, said Irvin Seah, an economist at DBS Bank. The services sector is likely to take over from the manufacturing sector as the main engine of growth in 2018. Although advance estimates showed Singapores economic growth slowing in the fourth quarter as factories lost steam, a services sector recovery has bolstered expectations the central bank could tighten monetary policy as early as April. The affluent-states full-year growth came in at the top end of the governments official 3.0-3.5 percent forecast range, its fastest expansion in three years. In Indonesia, shares closed down 0.3 percent, dragged down by financials and stocks of telecommunication services providers. It hit a record high earlier in the session. Bank Mandiri lost 1.9 percent, while clove cigarettes maker Gudang Garam fell 2.7 percent. Malaysia snapped three consecutive sessions of gains, led by consumer staples and telecommunication services. This is most likely the reaction towards strong share prices in the previous (trading) days, said Jolynn Kek, investment manager at Aberdeen Asset Management. Its only the first day of trading for the year, so its hard to say (if) its indicative of a longer term trend. Sime Darby Plantation Bhd slumped 8.5 percent, while Malayan Banking Bhd slipped 1.4 percent.

{'input': 'Have you ever fretted over buying a suit or dress online for a wedding or another flashy event, wondering how it would look on your frame or if it would even fit? That might not be a problem soon now that Amazon has patented a blended-reality mirror that lets you try on clothes virtually while placing you into a virtual location (via GeekWire )..The patent describes the mirror as partially-reflective and partially-transmissive, and uses a mix of displays, cameras, and projectors to create the blended image. The imagined mirror works by scanning the environment to generate a virtual model, and then identifies the face and eyes of the user to determine which objects are to be seen as a reflection. Once this process is completed, the virtual clothes and scene are transmitted through the mirror to create the blended-reality result..More from The Verge:.Samsungs new curved monitor has Thunderbolt 3.LG launches pink V30 ahead of CES.LGs 2018 TVs will have Google Assistant built in.Not all patented ideas turn into products, of course. But Amazon acquired Body Labs last year, an AI-software and computer vision company that once touted its ability to create 3D models of human bodies in motion and then dress them in virtual outfits. You can also draw a line of progression between the blended-reality mirror and Amazons Echo Look, a hands-free video camera that takes floor-length photos of you to provide style advice and fashion recommendations..Amazon has increasingly eyed a place in the fashion industry , ambitiously building up businesses in the sector, including launching its own clothing lines and developing algorithms that design clothing based on Instagram fashion trends.

{'input': 'Now that Utah Senator Orrin Hatch is retiring, the speculation is former Massachusetts Governor and 2012 GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney will run for his seat in the 2018 midterms..Spoiler Alert! He almost definitely will do just that. He even changed the location of his Twitter handle from Massachusetts to Utah just hours after the Hatch announcement..Second Spoiler Alert! If Romney runs as expected, hell win easily..Now for the harder part: What does Romney do once he goes to Washington?.He could become a Republican thorn in President Donald Trumps side and present a new front in the overall #Resist or #NeverTrump movement..After all, being an outspoken Republican critic of President Trump is a guaranteed ticket to major camera time on every cable news network outside of FOX. This surely will give Romney a chance to get back at President Trump for all the nasty things hes about him over the years..But that strategy wont pay off..Romney may not be a genius. But hes smart enough to see that Trump critics like outgoing Senators Jeff Flake and Bob Corker are going for less than a dime-a-dozen. Getting into tit-for-tat public spats with President Trump doesnt make anyone look good..Romney may not be a genius. But hes smart enough to see that Trump critics like Senators Jeff Flake and Bob Corker are going for less than a dime-a-dozen. Getting into tit-for-tat public spats with President Trump doesnt make anyone look good. The truth is Romney shouldnt join the herd. Instead he can seize the unique opportunity he has to truly distinguish himself in the Senate and in U.S. political history..Romneys special opportunity is all about Obamacare. To be more specific, its about the replacement for Obamacare that Congress and the White House will have to come up with to stabilize the insurance markets..Now that the tax reform law has eliminated the penalty for not having health insurance, the already depleted Obamacare exchanges will wither even more this year. Even when the individual mandate was in effect, there werent enough enrollees to cover the enormous cost of universal health coverage. Health insurance companies have spent years complaining about this, and now it will surely get worse..As a result, more insurers will stop offering Obamacare plans providing fewer and more expensive choices for the many Americans who do want coverage. The Congressional Budget Offices predictions concerning Obamacare over the years havent been so great , but the CBOs prediction that eliminating the individual mandate penalty will increase insurance premiums by 10 percent seems pretty reliable. .Republicans who are still reeling from their multiple failed efforts to replace Obamacare in 2016 will face more pressure to do something this year. It will be exceedingly difficult to pass a replacement during an election year, but once the new Congress is sworn in, it will be a real priority..In this environment, Congress and the president will have to do something..Enter Romney, who has more experience than most Republicans on government- health insurance because of his time setting up Romneycare as Governor of Massachusetts..During the 2012 presidential election, Romney insisted his plan was superior to Obamacare. Politically, Romneys argument was a tough sell to voters because it was obvious that Obamacare had largely been modeled after his own program in Massachusetts..But while Romney wasnt able to beat President Obama, he has a great chance to win over a critical mass of his fellow Republican and Democratic senators on this issue..Thats because Romney is still a Republican, but no one is likely to cast him as a toady for the Trump White House. That kind of designation helped elevate the importance of GOP senators like Flake and Corker, and especially Senator John McCain in Democrats eyes. It will help Romney too..Also helping him bridge the partisan divide is that Romney has long been an advocate for getting as many Americans covered as possible. Since 2015, hes even softened his criticism of Obamacare on that score. This too will earn him at least a chance to work with Democrats..On the other side of the aisle, Romneys argument for years is that major health insurance overhauls should be made at the state level. Thats just the kind of idea that could bring more of the states rights Republicans to the table..These factors are why Romney has the best chance of working out some kind of deal to forge a viable replacement for the ACA..Will anything positive for U.S. consumers come out of such a Romney-brokered new health care law? Obviously, wed all need to see the details before making such a prediction about a new bill. But the point is Romney is probably one of the only people in America who can win a 2018 Senate election and work successfully to get a health insurance bill passed in 2019..This is the path Romney should pursue to help not only his own reputation, but assist the entire country to move away from Trump-centered spats to a more substantive future..Commentary by Jake Novak, CNBC.com senior columnist.

{'input': 'With one simple tweet, Elon Musk shows a masterful lesson in leadership .Tweet is ‘liked’ 137,000 times and Musk individually responds to dozens of individual tweets PUBLISHED : Wednesday, 03 January, 2018, 2:07pm UPDATED : Wednesday, 03 January, 2018, 2:10pm 27 Dec 2017 .By Catherine Clifford .Billionaire tech entrepreneur Elon Musk is running electric car company Tesla and the aerospace company SpaceX. He’s planning to build a city on Mars. He’s a co-founder of the non-profit Open AI, which aims to prevent dangerous artificial intelligence, and the founder of Neuralink, a company working to connect the brain with computers. He has a lot going on. .And yet, the billionaire entrepreneur is not too busy to listen to his customers. .The day after Christmas, in a single tweet, Musk thanked Tesla customers for their support and asked what the company can do to improve. The tweet inspired an avalanche of responses. Wanted again to send a note of deep gratitude to Tesla owners WW for taking a chance on a new company that all experts said would fail. .So much blood, sweat & tears from the Tesla team went into creating cars that you’d truly love. I hope you do. .How can we improve further? .— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) December 26, 2017 .The tweet was “liked” 137,000 times (as of the publishing of this story). Musk’s responses to user feedback revealed he is “dying” to make a Tesla pick-up truck . He individually responded to about a dozen other tweets indicating various technological advances , like confirming an upgraded version of the autopilot software is on its way. .Customers were impressed with Musk’s willingness to interact with them. It’s incredible how you interface w/the public in real time about a very superior product you build and that people believe in. My partner wants one because of the obvious sense it makes to reduce his carbon footprint, but now I want one for its design w/crowd-sourced updates! .— tyrone | I.CON Studio (@tyrone_spencer) December 27, 2017 The next car I purchase will be a Tesla. What a creative, innovative, responsive CEO. .— Becky Brunton (@BeckyIB) December 28, 2017 .Indeed, listening to customers is a core tenet of being a successful entrepreneur and business owner, and Musk isn’t the only one who does it. .“My business philosophy is listen to your employees, listen to your customers. Shut up and do what they tell you,” T-Mobile CEO John Legere tells CNBC’s Jim Cramer . “The way I run my company is completely aligned with that.” .Meanwhile, the PhD inventor of the viral sensation Instant Pot, a multi-cooking device, perfects each new generation of his wildly popular gadget with user feedback. He tells CNBC Make It he’s read nearly all of the tens of thousands of reviews left on Amazon, and he pays the closest attention to the negative ones. .“Those are the reviews that will point out the shortcomings of the product and give us insight to improve the products,” says CEO Robert Wang . “Every 12 months to 18 months, we introduce the next generation of Instant Pot incorporating feedback from our real customers.” .Musk’s interaction directly with customers on Twitter is a fast, free, easy way to win loyalty and come up with ideas for improvement. It’s not, however, going to solve all his problems. .Musk is spending aggressively to reach his ambitious goals . His bold predictions and big spending have some industry watchers nervous, suspicious of his ability to succeed. .“To believe in the story, at this point you’re making a James Bond trade,” portfolio manager at Thornburg Investment Management Christian Hoffmann told CNBC at the end of November , speaking of Tesla. “The company needs to dodge the avalanche, avoid the gunfire, ski off the cliff, pull off the ripcord on their parachute and glide to safety so that they can save the world.” .See also:', 'output': "[['Elon Musk', 'PERSON', 'Has', 'Tesla', 'COMP'], ['Elon Musk', 'PERSON', 'Has', 'SpaceX', 'COMP'], ['Elon Musk', 'PERSON', 'Plan', 'Build', 'City', 'GPE'], ['Elon Musk', 'PERSON', 'Co-Found', 'Open AI', 'ORG'], ['Elon Musk', 'PERSON', 'Found', 'Neuralink', 'ORG'], ['Elon Musk', 'PERSON', 'Thank', 'Tesla', 'COMP', 'Customers'], ['Tesla', 'COMP', 'Operate_In', 'SECTOR'], ['Tesla', 'COMP', 'Improve', 'How'], ['Elon Musk', 'PERSON', 'Respond', 'Dozens', 'Number', 'Individual', 'Tweets'], ['Elon Musk', 'PERSON', 'Die', 'Make', 'Tesla', 'PRODUCT', 'Truck'], ['Elon Musk', 'PERSON', 'Confirm', 'Upgraded', 'Version', 'Autopilot', 'Software', 'Is', 'On', 'Its', 'Way'], ['Tyrone Spencer', 'PERSON', 'Want', 'Tesla', 'PRODUCT'], ['Becky Brunton', 'PERSON', 'Purchase', 'Next', 'Car', 'Tesla', 'PRODUCT'], ['Elon Musk', 'PERSON', 'Interface', 'Public', 'Real', 'Time', 'About', 'Superior', 'Product'], ['John Legere', 'PERSON', 'Business', 'Philosophy', 'Listen', 'Employees', 'Customers'], ['T-Mobile', 'COMP', 'CEO', 'John', 'PERSON'], ['Robert Wang', 'PERSON', 'Inventor', 'Instant', 'PRODUCT'], ['Instant', 'PRODUCT', 'Perfect', 'User', 'Feedback'], ['Instant', 'PRODUCT', 'Introduce', 'Next', 'Generation', 'Incorporating', 'Feedback'], ['Elon Musk', 'PERSON', 'Interact', 'Customers', 'Twitter'], ['Elon Musk', 'PERSON', 'Win', 'Loyalty'], ['Elon Musk', 'PERSON', 'Come', 'Ideas', 'Improvement'], ['Elon Musk', 'PERSON', 'Spend', 'Aggressively', 'Reach', 'Ambitious', 'Goals'], ['Tesla', 'COMP', 'Bold', 'Predictions'], ['Tesla', 'COMP', 'Big', 'Spending', 'Nervous', 'Industry', 'Watchers'], ['Tesla', 'COMP', 'Save', 'World']]", 'category': 'closed_qa'}

{'input': 'Republicans hold a razor-thin majority in the Senate as the body moves into the 2018 session. But a Republican former senator says one Democrat holds nearly all the legislative power: Minority Leader Chuck Schumer ..Chuck really controls the play of the field now, former Sen. Judd Gregg, R-N.H., said Tuesday on CNBCs  Squawk Box . What issues hes willing to be bipartisan on will determine whether there is legislation..The Senates top Democrat already held significant influence in a chamber with such a narrow majority — one that will shrink by one when Alabama Democrat Doug Jones is sworn in on Wednesday ..Gregg said the Senates voting rules for the 2018 fiscal year give Schumer even more sway over the legislative process..In passing sweeping tax reform at the end of 2017, Senate Republicans used a process known as reconciliation, shrinking the number of required votes to a simple majority..Republicans cant use this move again until the 2019 budget is passed — a circumstance that weakens the power of the slim Senate majority and necessitates cooperation..It changes everything, Gregg said. This means that everything that involves policy is going to have to be bipartisan. That puts all the cards in Chuck Schumers hands..Both parties legislative strategies will be affected by the lack of reconciliation, Gregg said. The New York Democrat, who represents a large constituency of staunch opponents of President Donald Trump and the Republican Party, may be empowered to undermine Republican bills at every turn. Republicans may be forced to abandon the sweeping legislative packages they introduced in 2017 in lieu of a more piecemeal approach..And this dynamic will play out as both parties look ahead to the midterm elections of 2018, which many analysts and statisticians claim will favor the Democrats..The bottom line is that Chuck Schumer basically controls the state of play in the Senate and therefore legislatively, Gregg said..Everything now is in the context of the next election.', 'output': '[[\'Republicans\', \'ORG/GOV\', \'Hold\', \'Senate\', \'GPE\'], [\'Senate\', \'GPE\', \'Move\', \'2018 Session\', \'EVENT\'], [\'Chuck Schumer\', \'PERSON\', \'Control\', \'Play\', \'CONCEPT\'], [\'Chuck Schumer\', \'PERSON\', \'Influence\', \'Senate\', \'GPE\'], [\'Doug Jones\', \'PERSON\', \'Sworn\', \'Wednesday\', \'DATE\'], [\'Senate\', \'GPE\', \'Use\', \'Reconciliation\', \'PROCESS\'], [\'Republicans\', \'ORG/GOV\', "Can\'t", \'Use\', \'Reconciliation\', \'PROCESS\'], [\'Slim Senate Majority\', \'ORG/GOV\', \'Weaken\', \'Power\', \'CONCEPT\'], [\'Chuck Schumer\', \'PERSON\', \'Cooperation\', \'Necessitate\', \'CONCEPT\'], [\'Chuck Schumer\', \'PERSON\', \'Control\', \'State\', \'CONCEPT\'], [\'Chuck Schumer\', \'PERSON\', \'Control\', \'Play\', \'CONCEPT\'], [\'Everything\', \'CONCEPT\', \'Context\', \'Next Election\', \'EVENT\']]', 'category': 'closed_qa'}

Beginning immediately, AdvisorEngine will invest significantly in CRM-related initiatives to further enhance Junxure functionality and integrate more deeply with third-party technology companies, including other CRM providers..AdvisorEngine is fully committed to an open-architecture technology framework. We know that every advisory firm is different, so we believe in delivering powerful workflows that are CRM-agnostic, Cancro said.

{'input': '48 Mins Ago | 01:45 SHARES .The twist in Thursdays episode of CNBCs  Jay Lenos Garage  involves Debbie Evans, a professional stuntwoman of nearly 40 years who is the unfamiliar face behind some of films most familiar action scenes. .In The Matrix Reloaded, she grinds against a highway wall and dodges airborne cars as a double for Carrie-Anne Mosss character, Trinity. In the Fast and Furious series, she drives underneath a semi-truck and flips her car into an embankment beside the road. She stands on motorcycle seats, jumps through glass and rides through fire. .Nearly every stunt that Evans does is dangerous, including the one she performs for Leno. CNBC Debbie Evans and Jay Leno on CNBCs Jay Lenos Garage .In the episode , Leno sits behind the wheel of his Ford Explorer, a box of donuts on the passenger seat beside him. When I get in a regular car, I like to feel safe, like this, he says, before going on to explain the importance of keeping your blood sugar levels balanced. .He grabs a donut and prepares to take a bite. Then, in dramatic fashion, he drops it underneath the passenger seat. Fumbling around for it, he begins to swerve and pick up speed and suddenly smacks the curb and goes airborne. The car soars, flips and crashes into a fruit stand, the rooftop screeching against the cement until the vehicle comes to a halt. .After a moment, Leno emerges from the vehicle unscathed, though a little sweaty. The donuts okay, he says. The donut is okay. He takes a bite. .Thats when the host breaks the fourth wall, exposing his set and crew, to introduce the expert who was actually sitting behind the wheel during the crash: Evans, dressed to match Leno with his trademark denim and a shaggy wig that the host says better resembles a Pomeranian. .I love your outfit, Leno tells her. .Dropping the donut was not a stunt, he later confirms for viewers. That was actually me dropping the donut. CNBC Jay Leno watching Debbie Evans stunt in Jay Lenos Garage .Evans began doing stunts in the 70s, drawing on a background in motorcycling and her biking skills. When I get in the car, she explains, I just totally understand things like traction, momentum, suspension, RPMs [a motors rotations per minute], weighting, unweighting, reading terrain. .With that awareness, after just a year as a stuntwoman, she won a car race in a CBS stunt competition, beating out nine of the top guys in Hollywood. It kind of put me on the map, she says. .In her successful career, according to IMDB, she has been featured in over 200 projects and has won seven Taurus World Stunt Awards , one of the highest acknowledgements in the stunt industry. She has also been inducted to the American Motorcyclist Hall of Fame. .Shes probably one of the greatest stunt performers in the history of the business, says Leno. You see, these guys are the real stars. I just eat donuts. .CNBCs  Jay Lenos Garage  airs Thursdays at 10 pm ET.', 'output': '[[\'Debbie Evans\', \'PERSON\', \'Participates_In\', \'Thursdays episode of CNBCs " Jay Lenos Garage "\', \'EVENT\'], [\'Debbie Evans\', \'PERSON\', \'Relate_To\', \'Some of films most familiar action scenes\', \'CONCEPT\'], [\'Debbie Evans\', \'PERSON\', \'Control\', \'Stuntwoman\', \'PROFESSION\'], [\'The Matrix Reloaded\', \'EVENT\', \'Feature\', \'Debbie Evans\', \'PERSON\'], [\'Fast and Furious\', \'EVENT\', \'Feature\', \'Debbie Evans\', \'PERSON\'], [\'Debbie Evans\', \'PERSON\', \'Perform\', \'Stunt for Jay Leno\', \'PERSON\'], [\'Ford Explorer\', \'PRODUCT\', \'Involved_In\', \'Stunt for Jay Leno\', \'PERSON\'], [\'Jay Leno\', \'PERSON\', \'Operate_In\', \'CNBCs "Jay Lenos Garage"\', \'EVENT\'], [\'Jay Leno\', \'PERSON\', \'Has\', \'Trademark denim and a shaggy wig\', \'PRODUCT\'], [\'Debbie Evans\', \'PERSON\', \'Win\', \'CBS stunt competition\', \'EVENT\'], [\'Debbie Evans\', \'PERSON\', \'Featured_In\', \'Over 200 projects\', \'EVENT\'], [\'Debbie Evans\', \'PERSON\', \'Win\', \'Seven Taurus World Stunt Awards\', \'EVENT\'], [\'Debbie Evans\', \'PERSON\', \'Inducted_To\', \'American Motorcyclist Hall of Fame\', \'ORG\'], [\'Jay Leno\', \'PERSON\', \'Relate_To\', \'Eating donuts\', \'CONCEPT\']]', 'category': 'closed_qa'}

Manufacturing growth in the worlds second largest economy unexpectedly accelerated to   as factories cranked up production to meet a surge in new orders, a private business survey showed.

An own goal from Christian Kabasele and a second half strike from Sergio Aguero added to Watford’s misery. .With one victory in their last nine games, Watford are 10th in the league with 25 points and Silva believes the addition of quality to their rearguard can stop them from leaking goals in the second half of the season. .”Yes, I hope. We are working. The board know what I expect,“ Silva said. ”It’s important with problems we have, if I have more players available for the next match it’s important for us. .“I’ve got to work with the players in the squad and develop and improve them though. But I hope we can improve.” .Watford have been hit hard by injuries to defenders Younes Kaboul and Miguel Britos and have conceded 40 goals in 21 games, behind only Stoke City (47). .Silva reckoned his team had not been bold at the back as was evident against the league leaders. .”We weren’t aggressive in our defence, it was too easy for them. The first 25 minutes we were too slow and we knew before the match they would push our team back. .“Against all teams home or away they do that. We need to do it in a different way and we didn’t do that.” .Watford take on Championship side (second tier) Bristol City in the third round of the FA Cup on Saturday before returning to league action against Southampton at Vicarage Road on Jan. 13.

The index had set scores of record highs and rose by one-fifth in value in 2017. .Major stock indexes closed 2017 with their best performance since 2013.

{'input': '(Repeats Jan 2 column. John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own).* Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2CduGpC.By John Kemp.LONDON, Jan 2 (Reuters) - Hedge funds are the most bullish about oil prices in years, expecting further gains even as prices touch multi-year highs and ignoring the risk linked to such a large concentration of positions..A record net long position has been accumulated by hedge funds and other money managers, amounting to 1,183 million barrels in the five biggest futures and options contracts covering crude, gasoline and heating oil..Portfolio managers held a record 1,328 million barrels of long positions in Brent, WTI, U.S. gasoline and U.S. heating oil on Dec. 26, according to data published by regulators and exchanges..By contrast, hedge funds held only 145 million barrels of short positions, the lowest level for 10 months and among the lowest at any point since the start of 2013..Fund managers now hold more than nine long positions for every short position, the most bullish picture for at least five years ( tmsnrt.rs/2CduGpC )..There are record net long positions in Brent crude (561 million barrels), WTI (461 million barrels) and U.S. heating oil (82 million barrels)..There are also large, if not quite record, net long positions in U.S. gasoline (79 million barrels) and European gasoil (131 million barrels)..In many of these contracts hedge fund positioning appears extremely stretched, with the ratio of long to short positions at multi-year highs..DOWNSIDE RISK The concentration of so many bullish positions poses a significant downside risk to prices if and when portfolio managers decide to close them out and realise some of their paper profits..For the time being, however, most fund managers are ignoring the liquidation risk and focusing on the prospect of further price increases first..There are plenty of reasons to be bullish about the outlook in 2018. The global economy is in a synchronised upswing and world trade is growing at the fastest rate since the start of the decade..Stocks of crude and products have fallen significantly since the middle of 2017. Oil demand is growing rapidly while OPEC and its allies have extended their production pact until at least the middle of the year..History suggests OPEC is more likely to tighten the oil market too much and allow prices to overshoot on the upside than rather than relax production cuts too early and risk prices falling back..Such was the case after both the previous oil market slumps in 1997/98 and 2008/09, with prices overshooting the producer group’s initial targets..OPEC’s tightening bias probably explains why many hedge funds remain bullish despite benchmark Brent prices moving towards $70 a barrel..The main downside risk comes from a resurgence of U.S. shale oil production, with WTI prices now above $60 a barrel..If shale output starts to climb faster than expected OPEC could be forced to halt production cuts earlier than currently envisaged..The existence of so many hedge fund long positions could eventually magnify the downside risk posed by U.S. shale..However, most hedge fund managers seem to have concluded that the risk is some way off and prices have more scope to climb before the inevitable correction..Related column:.“Brent prices caught in the calm before the storm?” Reuters, Dec. 20.

{'input': 'January 4, 2018 / 9:44 AM / in 31 minutes UK consumer lending growth slows to weakest since 2015: BoE Reuters Staff 3 Min Read .LONDON (Reuters) - British consumers increased their borrowing by the smallest amount since mid-2015 in the three months to November, suggesting households are slowly reining in spending, Bank of England figures showed on Thursday. Property sale signs are seen outside of a group of newly built houses in west London, Britain, November 23, 2017. REUTERS/Toby Melville .Britain’s economy saw lackluster growth for most of 2017 - especially compared to its faster-growing neighbors - and Thursday’s BoE data suggest this pattern continued toward the end of the year. .The central bank said unsecured consumer lending in the three months to November grew at an annualized rate of 8.5 percent, down from 9.3 percent in the three months to October and its weakest since June 2015. .The BoE has played down any suggestion of a debt bubble, though it has acknowledged pockets of risk and required banks to set aside more money against the risk of bad loans. .In cash term, borrowing was up by 1.4 billion pounds in November alone, compared with economists’ forecasts of a 1.5 billion pound rise in a Reuters poll. .Net mortgage approvals for house purchase were at the higher end of economists’ forecasts at 65,139 in November compared with 64,887 in October. .Earlier on Thursday major mortgage lender Nationwide said house prices overall last year grew at their slowest pace since 2012 and fell in London for the first time since 2009. .The central bank raised interest rates for the first time in more than a decade in November, reversing a cut made in August 2016, and indicated that further increases were likely in the coming years to keep inflation under control. .Figures last week from industry group UK Finance showed mortgage approvals by major banks dropped to a 15-month low. .Consumer credit growth has been slowing gradually since it peaked at nearly 11 percent in November 2016. .With Britain’s consumers being squeezed by slow wage growth and the jump in inflation that followed the 2016 Brexit vote, expectations for Christmas spending had been subdued. .However, major clothing retailer Next ( NXT.L ) reported stronger than expected Christmas sales on Wednesday and the Confederation of British Industry said sales growth had been solid in the early part of December.

{'input': 'January 2, 2018 / 4:39 PM / Updated 5 hours ago Starting new COPD inhaler tied to heart attack risk Lisa Rapaport 4 Min Read .(Reuters Health) - People with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who use long-acting inhaled bronchodilators may have an increased risk of heart attacks and strokes right after they start taking these medicines, a Taiwanese study suggests. .COPD is usually caused by smoking, and symptoms include breathing difficulty, cough, and wheezing. While some patients may use short-acting inhalers to quickly relieve occasional shortness of breath, people with more severe and persistent symptoms may be prescribed long-acting inhalers to help expand the airways and keep them open. .Compared to COPD patients who didn’t use long-acting bronchodilators, those who did were 50 percent more likely have cardiovascular problems like a heart attack or stroke within the first 30 days of starting to use these inhalers, the study found. .The absolute risk of problems like stroke, heart attack, rhythm disorders, and heart failure was still very low – around 1 percent – and the increased risk associated with long-acting bronchodilators disappeared over time, researchers report in JAMA Internal Medicine. .“Patients should know that their risk for cardiovascular diseases will be increased after initiation of bronchodilators even though the treatment is essential,” said Dr. Tadahiro Goto, a researcher at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston who wasn’t involved in the study. .While patients shouldn’t stop using inhalers, they should be vigilant about seeking medical attention for symptoms that might indicate a heart problem, such as chest pains or a suddenly rapid heart beat, Goto said by email. .To assess the connection between long-acting bronchodilators and heart problems, researchers examined data on 284,220 adults with COPD who had never used these medicines. .At the start of the study, patients were 71 years old on average, and researchers followed them for an average of 2 years. During that time, 37,719 people developed severe heart problems requiring emergency medical care. .Researchers looked at long-acting bronchodilators in two different families of medicines – beta-agonists and antimuscarinic antagonists – and didn’t see a difference in the risk of heart disease based on the type of drug or the dose. .The study wasn’t a controlled experiment designed to prove whether or how long-acting bronchodilators might influence the odds of severe heart problems in patients with COPD. .While these medicines are designed to widen the airways, they may also accelerate the heart rate, constrict blood vessels and increase blood pressure, said lead study author Meng-Ting Wang, of the National Defense Medical Center in Taipei, Taiwan. .Long-acting bronchodilators might also increase inflammation, which then leads to blockage of the blood vessels, Wang said by email. .It’s also possible that heart problems that appear linked to the medications in the study might have been there all along and misdiagnosed in some patients, said Dr. Shawn Aaron, a researcher at the University of Ottawa Medical School who wasn’t involved in the study. .Patients should have a follow-up exam after they start using these inhalers to make sure they’re not having symptoms that might be caused by cardiovascular disease, Aaron advised. .“No one should avoid these drugs if they are prescribed by a physician,” said Dr. Prescott Woodruff, a researcher at the University of California San Francisco who wasn’t involved in the study. .“They are very effective at improving lung function and reducing exacerbations in COPD,” Woodruff said by email. “The initiation of these drugs, in this instance, can simply be a marker for worsening symptoms of COPD or cardiovascular disease that is mistaken for COPD.” .SOURCE: bit.ly/2A6F4NM JAMA Internal Medicine, online January 2, 2018.', 'output': "[['People with COPD', 'GPE', 'Use', 'long-acting inhaled bronchodilators', 'PRODUCT'], ['long-acting inhaled bronchodilators', 'PRODUCT', 'Introduce', 'cardiovascular problems', 'CONCEPT'], ['COPD patients', 'GPE', 'More likely', 'cardiovascular problems', 'CONCEPT'], ['patients who used long-acting bronchodilators', 'GPE', '50 percent', 'cardiovascular problems', 'CONCEPT'], ['patients who didn’t use long-acting bronchodilators', 'GPE', 'cardiovascular problems', 'CONCEPT'], ['patients', 'GPE', 'Operate_In', 'first 30 days', 'TIME'], ['patients', 'GPE', 'cardiovascular problems', 'TIME'], ['patients', 'GPE', 'cardiovascular problems', 'long-acting bronchodilators', 'PRODUCT'], ['patients', 'GPE', 'cardiovascular problems', 'TYPE', 'CONCEPT'], ['patients', 'GPE', 'cardiovascular problems', 'dose', 'QUANTITY'], ['Researchers', 'PERSON', 'Examine', 'data on 284,220 adults with COPD', 'GPE'], ['Researchers', 'PERSON', 'Examine', 'data', 'DATA'], ['Researchers', 'PERSON', 'Examine', 'long-acting bronchodilators', 'PRODUCT'], ['Researchers', 'PERSON', 'Examine', 'two different families of medicines', 'PRODUCT'], ['Researchers', 'PERSON', 'Examine', 'beta-agonists', 'PRODUCT'], ['Researchers', 'PERSON', 'Examine', 'antimuscarinic antagonists', 'PRODUCT'], ['Researchers', 'PERSON', 'Examine', 'risk of severe heart problems', 'CONCEPT'], ['Researchers', 'PERSON', 'Examine', 'patients', 'GPE'], ['Researchers', 'PERSON', 'Examine', 'start of the study', 'TIME'], ['Researchers', 'PERSON', 'Examine', 'average of 2 years', 'TIME'], ['Researchers', 'PERSON', 'Examine', '37,719 people', 'GPE'], ['Researchers', 'PERSON', 'Examine', 'severe heart problems requiring emergency medical care', 'CONCEPT'], ['long-acting bronchodilators', 'PRODUCT', 'accelerate', 'heart rate', 'CONCEPT'], ['long-acting bronchodilators', 'PRODUCT', 'constrict', 'blood vessels', 'CONCEPT'], ['long-acting bronchodilators', 'PRODUCT', 'increase', 'blood pressure', 'CONCEPT'], ['long-acting bronchodilators', 'PRODUCT', 'increase', 'inflammation', 'CONCEPT'], ['long-acting bronchodilators', 'PRODUCT', 'lead to', 'blockage of the blood vessels', 'CONCEPT'], ['heart problems', 'CONCEPT', 'misdiagnosed', 'some patients', 'GPE'], ['Patients', 'GPE', 'Have', 'follow-up exam', 'CONCEPT'], ['Patients', 'GPE', 'Have', 'symptoms', 'CONCEPT'], ['Patients', 'GPE', 'Have', 'cardiovascular disease', 'CONCEPT'], ['No one', 'GPE', 'Avoid', 'drugs', 'PRODUCT'], ['drugs', 'PRODUCT', 'prescribed by a physician', 'PERSON'], ['drugs', 'PRODUCT', 'effective', 'improving lung function', 'CONCEPT'], ['drugs', 'PRODUCT', 'effective', 'reducing exacerbations', 'CONCEPT'], ['drugs', 'PRODUCT', 'marker', 'worsening symptoms of COPD', 'CONCEPT'], ['drugs', 'PRODUCT', 'marker', 'cardiovascular disease', 'CONCEPT']]", 'category': 'closed_qa'}

{'input': '* Investors await Fed minutes due on Wednesday * Technicals suggest gold rally is overstretched - analyst * Palladium drifts from record high hit on Tuesday (Updates prices, adds comment) By Jan Harvey LONDON, Jan 3 (Reuters) - Gold eased from an earlier 3-1/2 month high on Wednesday and was on track for its first day of losses in nearly three weeks as a firmer dollar pressured assets priced in the U.S. currency. The dollars late December retreat had driven gold sharply higher, leading to fears that the metal was becoming overbought. Spot gold was down 0.1 percent at $1,316.93 an ounce at 1430 GMT on Wednesday, off an earlier peak of $1,321.33. Its still the dollar that is still very much in the driving seat for gold, said Julius Baer analyst Carsten Menke. Were bearish on the euro versus the U.S. dollar, so if that materialises, and this close relationship holds between gold and the dollar, it should move towards $1,225 or so. The dollar rose 0.3 percent against the euro in early trade, though it remained near a four-month low after declining nearly 3 percent in the past three weeks. Investors are awaiting manufacturing data and minutes of a December U.S. Federal Reserve meeting due later in the day, which will be closely watched for clues on the outlook for U.S. monetary policy. Gold, which as a non-yielding asset is highly sensitive to rising interest rates, fell in the run-up to the third U.S. interest rate rise of 2017 in December but quickly recovered, climbing 5 percent from its mid-month low to the years close. Spot golds 14-day relative strength index (RSI) touched 75 on Tuesday, it highest since September 2017. An RSI above 70 indicates a commodity is overbought and could herald a price correction, technical analysts say. Relative strength index shows the metal at overbought levels, which may lead to short-term selling, ScotiaMocatta analysts said in a research note. U.S. gold futures for February delivery were up $2.80 an ounce at $1,318.90. Among other precious metals, palladium was down 0.5 percent at $1,086.80 after hitting a record high on Tuesday of $1,096.50. The metal soared 56 percent in 2017 on fears that strong demand from carmakers for use in catalytic converters, chiefly in gasoline-powered vehicles, would tighten the market further after years of deficit. You have a market that is on the one hand in deficit, and on the other very well managed by some of the bigger producers, who are unwilling to ship additional units into the market, Bank of America-Merrill Lynch analyst Michael Widmer said. Unless you start to see a meaningful change in dynamics on the supply and demand side, I can see prices either well-supported or even higher from here.

{'input': 'MISSION VIEJO, Calif., Jan. 02, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- MYnd Analytics, Inc. (NASDAQ:MYND), the market leader in improving the delivery of mental health through the combination of telemedicine and data analytics/augmented intelligence, today provided a business update..Recent highlights include:.Completed the acquisition of revenue-generating Arcadian Telepsychiatry Services which is anticipated to generate rapid growth and benefits from cross-selling going forward Well positioned to capitalize on the new collaborative care reimbursement model and to assist value-based medical practices and systems to improve outcomes and to reduce costs First patient enrolled in a 600-patient paid pilot with Horizon Healthcare Services, Inc. to improve patient care over trial and error medication management and to reduce total costs of care Completed pharmacoeconomic dossier showing significant potential savings when following PEER recommendations as compared to trial and error prescribing Completed financing of $8.79 million, coinciding with listing on NASDAQ Hired sales team targeting strong revenue growth for 2018 Ended fiscal year with solid balance sheet; over $5 million of cash.George Carpenter, CEO of MYnd Analytics, commented, “2017 was a transformative year for the company as we achieved a number of important milestones. Most recently, we completed the acquisition of Arcadian Telepsychiatry Services, which manages the delivery of telepsychiatry and tele-mental health services throughout the United States. Telemedicine is one of the fastest growing areas of healthcare services today and directly addresses the shortage of mental health providers and the growing need for behavioral health services. The American Psychiatric Association estimates through effective integration of medical and behavioral health services $26-48 billion could be saved annually..Mr. Carpenter continued, This acquisition provides us a foothold in the rapidly growing telemedicine market, as well as an opportunity to leverage our unique technology platform. Combining Arcadian’s capabilities with MYnd’s data analytics capabilities will provide patients greater access to care, reduce costs, and help doctors to reduce trial and error prescribing, which is the current standard in mental health treatment. I am pleased to report the integration is progressing well, and that Arcadian’s business is growing rapidly. As a result, we believe Arcadian will be a major contributor to our revenue in 2018 and beyond.”.“I am also pleased to report that we are gaining significant traction with our Psychiatric EEG Evaluation Registry (“PEER”) platform technology. To this end, we have started to enroll patients in the first payor demonstration project with Horizon Healthcare Services, Inc., in New Jersey. This project is a paid 600 patient pilot to evaluate the cost savings and reduction in trial and error prescribing when utilizing the PEER report to assist in treatment decision making. Additionally, it is designed to demonstrate that using PEER Online® will reduce total costs of care. An independent study by Cedar Associates, LLC, a Stanford Health Policy Adjunct Affiliate estimated a 4.7-fold cost savings, net cost of the test, could be achieved, which makes our program very appealing for payers. With over 3.8 million patients in its network, Horizon itself represents a $48 million potential annual market for MYnd, from a single payor in one state. We look forward to adding additional pilot programs in 2018 and to rolling out our offering with our expanded telepsychiatry capabilities.”.“Coverage for mental health continues to expand and CPT codes are in place for reimbursement. The Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act (MHPAEA) requires health plans to ensure parity between medical/surgical benefits and mental health/substance use disorder (MH/SUD) benefits. In addition, Medicare recently added coverage and reimbursement for Psychiatric Collaborative Care Management Services under the Collaborative Care Model (CoCM). Under CoCM, there is greater financial incentive for both the primary care provider and the consulting psychiatrist to collaborate in providing care to patients. Specifically, the consulting psychiatrist provides the primary care practice with specialized expertise through regular case review and recommendations for therapeutic and pharmacological treatment, medication adjustments, and additional specialty care. We believe this important shift will expand the market for both telepsychiatry and for the use of PEER.”.“Looking ahead to 2018, we believe we are poised for rapid growth. We have expanded our sales force and plan to accelerate our patient-direct marketing through social media and through other digital media initiatives, which should help to drive sales growth. We are also enhancing both our operational and financial infrastructure to support our anticipated growth and listing requirements. We ended the fiscal year-end on September 30, 2017 with no long-term debt and over $5 million cash. Our financials reflect a one-time, $16 million non-cash expense related to the issuance of warrants in our last financing transaction. Given the tremendous progress we made in 2017, our anticipated growth, scalable business model, and solid balance sheet, we believe we are well positioned to drive shareholder value in 2018 and beyond.”.About MYnd Analytics.MYnd Analytics, Inc.

{'input': 'OSLO (Reuters) - Norway has suspended exports of weapons and ammunition to the United Arab Emirates over concerns they could be used in the war in Yemen, the Foreign Ministry said on Wednesday..The UAE is part of a Saudi-led coalition formed in 2015 to fight the Iran-aligned Houthi group that controls most of northern Yemen and the capital Sanaa, in a war that has killed more than 10,000 people and displaced more than 3 million..While there is currently no evidence that Norwegian-made ammunition has been used in Yemen, there was a rising risk related to the UAE’s military involvement there, the ministry said..“The decision reflects the strict precautionary approach taken by Norway,” it added..Existing export permits had been temporarily revoked and no new licences would be issued under the current circumstances. The decision was made on Dec. 19, but was not made public until Wednesday..In 2016, Norwegian exports of weapons and ammunition to the UAE rose to 79 million Norwegian crowns ($9.7 million) from 41 million in 2015, Statistics Norway data showed..Human rights groups and several members of Norway’s parliament have for months campaigned for a halt in arms exports to the UAE..“It is fantastic that the government finally has taken responsibility to end weapons exports to a country which is active in the bombing of schools and hospitals in Yemen,” said Line Hegna, a spokeswoman for the Norwegian branch of rights group Save the Children..“Furthermore, we are hopeful that the decision taken by the Norwegian government can act as an example for other exporting nations to act responsibly in the face of repeated violations of international humanitarian law,” she added..The sale of arms to Saudi Arabia and other coalition members has also stirred debate in other European countries, including Britain. Last July, London’s High Court rejected a claim by campaigners that billions of dollars’ worth of arms sales to Saudi Arabia should be halted because they were being used in Yemen in violation of international humanitarian law..A spokesperson for the Department for International Trade said on Wednesday that the British government “operates one of the most robust arms export control regimes in the world”..“We rigorously examine every application, including those from the UAE, on a case-by-case basis against the Consolidated EU and National Arms Export Licensing Criteria. We will not grant a licence if to do so would be inconsistent with these criteria,” the spokesperson said..The opposition Labour party, however, said it would continue to call for the suspension of all British arms sales to Saudi Arabia “until there is evidence of a complete halt to the use of British weapons against any civilian population”..While weapons exports to the UAE have been allowed since 2010, Norway does not permit sale of arms or ammunition to Saudi Arabia..The Norwegian parliament’s foreign relations committee is due to debate the country’s arms sales later this month..UAE officials were not immediately available for comment..($1 = 8.1228 Norwegian crowns).Reporting by Terje Solsvik; Additional reporting by William James in London and Sami Aboudi in Dubai; Editing by Catherine Evans.

{'input': 'Manhattan real estate sales and prices took a fall in the fourth quarter, and theyre likely to slide even further this year after the new tax rules take effect..Total sales volume fell 12 percent compared with the fourth quarter of last year — the lowest quarterly level in six years, according to a report from Douglas Elliman Real Estate and Miller Samuel, the appraisal firm. The average sales price in Manhattan fell below $2 million for the first time in nearly two years..Brokers say the declines were simply the result of uncertainty around the Republican tax plan, as buyers held off until the details of the new law became clear. They say many of those buyers have since rushed in and will help show a rebound..Yet the luxury market in Manhattan is suffering from an expanding glut of high-end and highly priced apartments. And analysts say that while sales may rebound slightly in the first quarter of 2018, the tax law — which limits the deductibility of state and local taxes — will continue to add pressure to New York City housing prices, especially at the top..There will be an impact on prices and sales, said Jonathan Miller, president and CEO of Miller Samuel. But it may take up to a year and a half to two years to see the full impact..The high end of the Manhattan market is showing the biggest cracks. Inventory of luxury apartments — those in the top 10 percent by price — grew by 15 percent. There is now a 17-month supply of luxury apartments in Manhattan, up from 10 months a year ago..And with giant new condo towers sprouting up in every corner of the city, those numbers are likely to grow..Miller said that resales — as opposed to new development — are holding up strong, with median sales prices up by 2 percent over last year. But prices for new developments fell 17 percent over last year and the number of sales are down 20 percent..The number of new developments is expected to continue to rise this year and next, which will add to inventory, Miller said. While demand for low-end apartments priced at $1 million to $2 million remains strong, sales of apartments of more than $5 million will get tougher. In part, thats because the rich have more discretion on when and where to buy homes — and with the costs of owning a home in New York going up with the tax plan, apartments aimed at the rich will see the biggest price hits..Miller said that while buyers have already adjusted, sellers may take more time to catch up..The sellers were already recalibrating after 2015, he said.

{'input': 'January 3, 2018 / 3:02 PM / Updated 17 hours ago Graphic - New Year bounce extends palladiums rally to record high Jan Harvey 5   Palladium extended last year’s more than 50 percent surge to hit record highs on Tuesday, as Chinese car sales growth, tightening emissions controls and a swing away from diesel cars in Europe fuelled fears of a metal shortage after years of market deficit. .Spot palladium XPD= hit a peak of $1,096.50 an ounce on Tuesday, just above its 2001 high of $1,095 an ounce. .A switch to gasoline-powered and hybrid cars, which use more palladium in their autocatalysts, has fuelled fears that market tightness could lead to a shortage of supply. The market has been in deficit in six out of the last seven years for which data is available. .That shortfall has led to a draw-down of available stocks. Holdings of palladium-backed exchange-traded funds fell to their lowest since 2010 last year, with some analysts citing market tightness, which they say drew physical metal out of the funds. .Palladium, some three-quarters of which is used in catalytic converters, chiefly for gasoline engines, hit a series of 17-year highs in 2017 on expectations that automotive demand would continue to improve. .“Underlying the speculative investment flows is a very strong fundamental picture,” ICBC Standard Bank analyst Tom Kendall said. “Palladium is one of the few metals markets that is genuinely tight and looks like it will continue to tighten.” .“When you overlay the growth in car sales in China, which is a gasoline market, with the ongoing switch away from diesel in Europe, it adds up to a much better demand story for palladium than for platinum,” he said. “That is drawing down inventories, and there is no easy supply response.” .Diesel market share in Europe has been under pressure since carmaker Volkswagen admitted in 2015 that it had used illegal software to cheat U.S. emissions tests, slipping below 50 percent the following year for the first time since 2009. .Meanwhile, Chinese car sales growth held firm in 2017. .While there are solid reasons for palladium’s move, analysts said the strength of its recent gains suggests it may be overstretched in the near term. The metal eased 1 percent on Wednesday, though it remains at elevated levels. .“The fundamentals are strong, it’s true, and this is spilling over into continued tight physical availability which is reflected in the outright price and a deeply backwardated forward market,” Mitsubishi analyst Jonathan Butler said, referring to the higher price of palladium contracts for imminent delivery versus the more distant future. .“But this has the mark of a spec squeeze especially given (Tuesday‘s) thin trading, right at the start of the year with many market participants still enjoying holidays.” .In the longer term, there are clear risks to the rally. Palladium’s heavy reliance on car sales for demand - unlike platinum, its jewellery market is small - could make it vulnerable to a sharp retracement if signs emerge that sales are slowing. .A move towards vehicle electrification would also cut down demand for catalytic converters. However, that is too far off to pose a significant risk the market at present, Kendall said. “I don’t think it is within anyone’s ability to take a commodities investment position on e-vehicles yet,” he said. “There are so many unknowns.” .In the meantime, market tightness has sent the metal back to levels not seen since 2001, a time when U.S. carmakers were panicking over the U.S. authorities’ shift in emphasis to tackling unburned hydrocarbon emissions, GFMS’ head of research and forecasts Rhona O‘Connell said. This rally looks more solid, she said. .“This time around it’s genuine fundamentals (that are driving the rally), and some spec activity, in the belief that the pressure on diesel will favour gasoline,” she said. .For the graphic Palladium market balance vs price, click - reut.rs/2CbLOvG .For the graphic Palladium automotive demand vs price, click - reut.rs/2CFs4BF .For the graphic Chinese car sales vs palladium, click - reut.rs/2CJgJRa .For the graphic Metals performance 2017, click - reut.rs/2CipuUw Reporting by Jan Harvey; Editing by Veronica Brown and Mark Potter', 'output': "[['Palladium', 'CONCEPT', 'Has', '50 Percent Surge', 'ECON_INDICATOR'], ['Palladium', 'CONCEPT', 'Impact', 'Shortage Fear', 'CONCEPT'], ['Palladium', 'CONCEPT', 'Operate_In', 'Automotive Industry', 'SECTOR'], ['Autocatalysts', 'CONCEPT', 'Use', 'Palladium', 'CONCEPT'], ['Autocatalysts', 'CONCEPT', 'Use', 'Palladium', 'CONCEPT'], ['Palladium', 'CONCEPT', 'Relate_To', 'Gasoline Engines', 'CONCEPT'], ['Palladium', 'CONCEPT', 'Relate_To', 'Hybrid Cars', 'CONCEPT'], ['Palladium', 'CONCEPT', 'Relate_To', 'Diesel Cars', 'CONCEPT'], ['Palladium', 'CONCEPT', 'Relate_To', 'Chinese Car Sales', 'CONCEPT'], ['Palladium', 'CONCEPT', 'Relate_To', 'Europe Diesel Market', 'SECTOR'], ['Palladium', 'CONCEPT', 'Relate_To', 'European Platinum Market', 'SECTOR'], ['Palladium', 'CONCEPT', 'Relate_To', 'Physical Metal', 'CONCEPT'], ['Palladium', 'CONCEPT', 'Relate_To', 'ETF Holdings', 'CONCEPT'], ['Palladium', 'CONCEPT', 'Relate_To', 'Speculative Investment Flows', 'CONCEPT'], ['Palladium', 'CONCEPT', 'Relate_To', 'Fundamental Picture', 'CONCEPT'], ['Palladium', 'CONCEPT', 'Relate_To', 'Tight Market', 'CONCEPT'], ['Palladium', 'CONCEPT', 'Relate_To', 'Supply Response', 'CONCEPT'], ['Palladium', 'CONCEPT', 'Relate_To', 'Car Sales in China', 'CONCEPT'], ['Palladium', 'CONCEPT', 'Relate_To', 'Diesel Market Share in Europe', 'CONCEPT'], ['Palladium', 'CONCEPT', 'Relate_To', 'Gasoline Market', 'CONCEPT'], ['Palladium', 'CONCEPT', 'Relate_To', 'Platinum Market', 'SECTOR'], ['Palladium', 'CONCEPT', 'Relate_To', 'Jewelry Market', 'SECTOR'], ['Palladium', 'CONCEPT', 'Relate_To', 'Electrification', 'CONCEPT'], ['Palladium', 'CONCEPT', 'Relate_To', 'U.S. Authorities', 'ORG/GOV'], ['U.S. Authorities', 'ORG/GOV', 'Shift', 'Emphasis', 'CONCEPT'], ['U.S. Authorities', 'ORG/GOV', 'Shift', 'Emphasis', 'CONCEPT'], ['U.S. Car Makers', 'ORG', 'Panic', 'U.S. Authorities Shift', 'ORG/GOV'], ['GFMS', 'ORG', 'Head', 'Research and Forecasts', 'CONCEPT'], ['GFMS', 'ORG', 'Head', 'Research and Forecasts', 'CONCEPT'], ['Rhona O‘Connell', 'PERSON', 'Say', 'Genuine Fundamentals Drive Rally', 'CONCEPT'], ['Rhona O‘Connell', 'PERSON', 'Say', 'Spec Activity', 'CONCEPT'], ['Rhona O‘Connell', 'PERSON', 'Say', 'Pressure on Diesel Will Favor Gasoline', 'CONCEPT'], ['Metals Performance', 'CONCEPT', '2017', 'Click', 'reut.rs/2CipuUw'], ['Jan Harvey', 'PERSON', 'Report', 'Palladium Market', 'CONCEPT'], ['Jan Harvey', 'PERSON', 'Report', 'Palladium Market', 'CONCEPT'], ['Veronica Brown', 'PERSON', 'Edit', 'Palladium Market', 'CONCEPT'], ['Mark Potter', 'PERSON', 'Edit', 'Palladium Market', 'CONCEPT']]", 'category': 'closed_qa'}

{'input': 'By Bloomberg 10:35 AM EST .Advanced Micro Devices Inc. surged in early trading after a report that Intel Corp., its only remaining rival in the market for personal computer processors, has a flaw in its products that makes commonly used operating systems vulnerable to hackers. .According to technology website The Register, Intel has a bug that lets some software gain access to parts of a computer’s memory that are set aside to protect things like passwords. All computers with Intel chips from the past 10 years appear to be affected, the report said, and patches to Microsoft Corp.’s Windows and Apple Inc.’s OS X operating systems will be required. The security updates may slow down older machinery by as much as 30 percent, according to the report. .“This is a black eye for Intel and a natural beneficiary is AMD in the arms race on the chip side,” said Dan Ives, head of tech research at GBH Insights. “Especially as you’ve seen an ultracompetitive environment with a slowing traditional PC chip cycle, this is a step back, this is a potential PR nightmare. They need to get ahead of this and try to contain any of the damage to customers as well to the brand.” .AMD shares surged as much as 7.2 percent to $11.77 Wednesday. Intel fell as much as 3.8 percent, the most since April, to $45.05. An Intel spokesman declined to comment. .Flaws in the designs of microprocessors, which go through rigorous testing and verification, are usually easily fixed by patches in the code that they use to communicate with the rest of the computer. If the error can’t be fixed easily in software, chip redesigns are extremely costly and time consuming. Historically, the way companies respond to the issue and how quickly they address it has determined how big a problem it becomes. .Chip design flaws are exceedingly rare. More than 20 years ago, a college professor discovered a problem with how early versions of Intel’s Pentium chip calculated numbers. Rival International Business Machines was able to make use of the finding and claim Intel products would cause frequent problems for consumers’ computers. While that didn’t happen, Intel had to recall some chips and took a charge of more than $400 million. .Intel’s microprocessors are the fundamental building block of the internet, corporate networks and PCs. The company has added to its designs over the years trying to make computers less vulnerable to attack, arguing that hardware security is typically tougher to crack than software. .The Santa Clara, California-based company’s chips have more than 80 percent market share overall and more than 90 percent in laptops and servers. .Programmers have been working for two months to try to patch the flaw in open-source Linux system, The Register said, adding that Microsoft was expected to release a patch for the issue soon.

Snow comes down near Atlanta in Tucker, Georgia, U.S. on December 8th, 2017. REUTERS/Chris Aluka Berry .Many school districts shut their classrooms due to the cold snap, which claimed four lives over the long New Year’s weekend. .The National Weather Service issued wind chill warnings for Tuesday as dangerously low temperatures were due from eastern Montana across the Midwest into the Atlantic coast and the Northeast and down through the deep South. .School districts in Iowa, Massachusetts, Indiana, Ohio and North Carolina canceled or delayed the start of classes as bitterly cold temperatures, 20 degrees to 30 degrees Fahrenheit (11 to 17 degrees Celsius) below normal, were expected across the eastern half of the United States. .“Just the bitter cold which is just too dangerous to put kids out on the street waiting for a bus that may not come,” Herb Levine, superintendent of the Peabody Public Schools, north of Boston, told a local CBS affiliate television station. .The cold was blamed for the deaths of two men in separate incidents in Milwaukee, according to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. A homeless man was found dead on a porch in Charleston, West Virginia, while another man was found dead outside a church in Detroit and police said he may have froze to death, local news outlets reported. .Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser urged residents to call the city if they saw people outside. .“We want every resident to have shelter and warmth,” she said in a tweet. .Many places across the United States experienced record low temperatures over the last few days.

{'input': 'When you decide to move your individual retirement account, you want to avoid one error that can make all of your money taxable..Savers may choose to roll over their retirement funds because they have changed employers or want to access different investment options..Be very careful to avoid this fatal trap of getting caught in the once-per-year IRA rollover rule, said Ed Slott, founder of Ed Slott & Co. and an expert on individual retirement accounts..The right way to roll over an IRA is to do a direct trustee-to-trustee or bank-to-bank transfer, Slott told CNBC. That way, the money goes from one IRA to another and never touches your hands..You want to avoid the other way of rolling over an IRA, Slott said, which is the 60-day rollover. This transaction results in the money leaving your IRA with a check payable to you. You then have 60 days to transfer the money into another IRA..The problem with this is that you can only do one per year. That one-year limitation is not according to the calendar year, Slott cautioned, but every 365 days. The once-per-year IRA rollover rule also applies to both IRAs and Roth IRAs..If you do a second rollover, its taxable.

A State Department spokeswoman said North Korea “might be trying to drive a wedge of some sort”. .Kim ordered the reopening of the hotline at the truce village of Panmunjom at 0630 GMT on Wednesday, when South Korean officials at the border received a call from the North, the South’s unification ministry said in a text message. .Officials on both sides were checking the line and conducting a conversation for about 20 minutes, the contents of which were not disclosed by the ministry. .That gesture came only hours after Trump, who has mocked Kim as “Little Rocket Man”, again ridiculed the North Korean leader on Twitter. .“Will someone from his depleted and food starved regime please inform him that I too have a Nuclear Button, but it is a much bigger & more powerful one than his, and my Button works!” Trump tweeted. .Trump and Kim have exchanged a series of bellicose comments in recent months, raising alarm across the world, with Trump at times dismissing the prospect of a diplomatic solution to a crisis in which North Korea has threatened to destroy the United States. .While appearing to open the door to discussing taking part in the Winter Olympics, Kim also warned that he would push ahead with “mass producing” nuclear warheads in defiance of U.N. sanctions. .His New Year’s Day speech came after a steep increase in missile launches in 2017, as well as the North’s sixth and most powerful nuclear test. Kim, who has vowed to develop a nuclear-tipped missile capable of reaching the United States, said he had a nuclear button on his desk.

Slideshow (9 Images) .The talks would aim to establish formal dialogue about sending a North Korean delegation to the Olympics, Ri said. .South Korean presidential spokesman Yoon Young-chan said the North’s decision to open the hotline had “significant meaning” because it could lead to constant communication. .U.S. officials had voiced scepticism about the possibility of meaningful talks, particularly if they did not take steps towards banning North Korea’s nuclear weapons. .Nikki Haley, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, warned North Korea against staging another missile test and said Washington was hearing reports that Pyongyang might be preparing to fire another missile. .Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said both sides should seize the Olympics as an opportunity to improve ties and make concrete efforts toward alleviating tension. .“All relevant sides should grab hold of this positive trend in the Korean peninsula and move in the same direction,” Geng told a daily news briefing in Beijing. .North Korea regularly threatens to destroy South Korea, the United States and Japan, and says its weapons are necessary to counter U.S. aggression.

{'input': 'January 3, 2018 / 1:43 PM / Updated 10 minutes ago First UK polar bear in 25 years born at Scottish zoo Reuters Staff 2 Min Read .EDINBURGH (Reuters) - A polar bear cub has been born in Britain for the first time in 25 years, the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland said on Wednesday. .Mother polar bear Victoria is believed to have given birth at the Highland Wildlife Park in northeastern Scotland after staff heard high pitched cries in late December. .“We first heard promising noises in the week before Christmas and these have now continued into the new year,” said Una Richardson, the park’s head keeper. .“Because we don’t have sight inside her cubbing box we can’t be sure if Victoria has had more than one cub but we can confirm the birth,” she added. .Polar bears are known for their need for privacy and new- borns are extremely delicate, so the maternity den is closed to visitors at the zoo. The survival of the cub or cubs will not be fully confirmed until March, when bears emerge after winter. .The polar bear breeding season began in March last year, during which time Victoria mated with Arktos, one of the park’s two males. .“While we are absolutely thrilled, we are not celebrating prematurely as polar bear cubs have a high mortality rate in the first weeks of life due to their undeveloped immune system and the mother’s exaggerated need for privacy, with any disturbance risking the cub being killed or abandoned,” Richardson said. .Polar bears are born about 30 cm long and weigh roughly the same as a guinea pig. They emerge blind and do not open their eyes until they are about a month old, depending entirely on their mother’s milk.

However, regulators have been tightening controls on the fast-growing 3.5 billion pound ($4.8 billion) spreadbetting industry. REGULATORY CHALLENGES .Shares in British spreadbetting firms sank last month after the European Securities   (ESMA) said it may curb core parts of their market under new powers from January. .Additionally, Britain’s markets watchdog said it had noticed steady growth in the volume of CFDs linked to digital currencies and would step up its scrutiny of the initial coin offering market or digital currency fund-raising, to see if new rules are needed to protect investors after issuing an alert in September. .The Financial Conduct Authority also said it supported the ESMA in its consideration of potential EU-wide product intervention.

{'input': 'GAZA (Reuters) - The Palestinian Authority said on Wednesday it asked Israel to fully restore Israeli electricity flows to the Gaza Strip, a move that could nearly double the daily connection time in an enclave suffering severe power shortages..There was no immediate word from Israel whether it would comply at a time when it says the Islamist Hamas group, which controls Gaza, bears overall responsibility for recent cross-border rocket attacks launched by smaller militant factions..In a statement, Hussein Al-Sheikh, Palestinian minister of civil affairs, said the Palestinian Authority would again guarantee payment of Gaza’s Israeli electricity bill and ask Israel to restore the 50 megawatts of power, out of a total 120 megawatts, that it had supplied to the area..A statement issued by Prime Minister Rami Al-Hamdallah said the request was to “alleviate the suffering of the people of Gaza and to improve living conditions.”.Gaza’s two million residents now receive only three to four hours of electricity a day, with schools, factories, hospitals and households affected. A Gaza economist said restoration of power from Israel, the enclave’s main electricity supplier, could raise that figure to six hours. Gaza’s sole power station generates only a small amount of electricity..In April, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas announced he was cancelling the guarantee, part of a bid to press Hamas to loosen its hold over the enclave, a decade after the Islamist movement seized the territory from forces loyal to him..Prompted partly by Abbas’s sanctions and fears of financial and political isolation, Hamas signed an Egyptian-brokered reconciliation agreement with his Fatah movement in October and agreed to hand over administrative control of the Gaza Strip to the Western-backed Palestinian Authority..But both groups have failed to finalize details of the deal, which had been due to be completed on December 1. The Authority’s decision to resume the electricity payments could help smooth the way towards completing the accord..The PA’s request coincides with heightened Israeli-Palestinian tensions..Palestinians have been mounting protests in the occupied West Bank and violence has flared along the Israel-Gaza border since U.S. President Donald Trump announced on Dec. 6 that he was recognizing Jerusalem as Israel’s capital. Palestinians want East Jerusalem as the capital of a state they seek to establish in the occupied West Bank and the Gaza Strip..In the West Bank on Wednesday, Israeli troops shot dead a 17-year-old Palestinian during a confrontation with stone-throwing protesters, Palestinian medics said. An Israeli military spokeswoman said he appeared to have been holding a firearm..His death raised to 13 the number of Palestinians killed in clashes with Israeli forces since Trump’s declaration, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry. There have been no Israeli fatalities or serious injuries in the confrontations or as a result of the rocket strikes..Two Hamas gunmen were killed in one Israeli retaliatory air strike in December..Writing by Ori Lewis; Editing by Jeffrey Heller and William Maclean.

{'input': 'NEW YORK, Jan 3 (Reuters) - The margin of investors who said they had fewer longer-dated Treasuries than their benchmarks over those who held more than their benchmarks fell to an 11-week low, JPMorgan Chase & Cos latest client survey showed on Wednesday. Investors had ramped up holdings of longer-dated government debt at year-end following the most dramatic overhaul of the U.S. tax code in 30 years and on expectations that inflation would remain muted and the Federal Reserve would raise short-term interest rates further in 2018. On Tuesday, they scaled back long bond positions partly in reaction to hawkish comments from two European Central Bank officials. Benoit Coeure and Ewald Nowotny in separate published interviews on Monday suggested the ECB may not extend its 2.55 trillion euro bond purchase program which expires in September if the euro zone economy shows more strength. The share of investors who said on Monday they were short longer-dated Treasuries fell to 40 percent from 45 percent on Dec. 18. JPMorgan skipped publishing its survey last week over the Christmas holiday. The share of investors who said they were long rose to 15 percent from 11 percent on Dec. 18. The net shorts decreased to 25 percent from 34 percent two weeks earlier. Among active clients including market makers and hedge funds, net shorts in longer-dated Treasuries fell to 50 percent from 60 percent two weeks ago. At 12:31 p.m. (1725 GMT), the 10-year Treasury yield was 2.442 percent, down 2 basis points from late on Tuesday but up from 2.392 percent two weeks earlier.

But if it does, we must bring even tougher measures to bear against the North Korean regime,” Haley said. .South Korea on Tuesday offered talks with North Korea next week, amid a tense standoff over Pyongyang’s nuclear and missile programmes, after North Korean leader Kim Jong Un said in a New Year’s Day speech that he was “open to dialogue” with Seoul. .Kim also said he was open to the possibility of North Korean athletes taking part in Winter Olympics South Korea hosts next month. .At the same time, he stressed that his country would push ahead with “mass producing” nuclear warheads in defiance of U.N. sanctions and that he had a nuclear button on his desk capable of launching missiles at the United States. .Haley said the United States would not take talks seriously if they did not take steps toward banning North Korea’s nuclear weapons. .“North Korea can talk to anyone they want, but the U.S. is not going to recognise it or acknowledge it until they agree to ban the nuclear weapons that they have,” she said. .Haley gave no details of the missile test preparations. .Another U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said there were indications that could point towards a potential missile launch “sooner rather than later,” but cautioned that such signs had been seen in the past and no test had resulted. .‘DRIVE A WEDGE’ .U.S. State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said North Korea might be “trying to drive a wedge of some sort” between the United States and South Korea and added that while it was up to Seoul to decide who it talked to: “We are very sceptical of Kim Jong Un’s sincerity in sitting down and having talks.” .U.S. President Donald Trump, who has led a global drive to pressure North Korea through sanctions to give up development of nuclear-tipped missiles capable of hitting the United States, earlier held back judgement on Pyongyang’s offer to talk, saying on Twitter: FILE PHOTO - South Koreas President Moon Jae-In talks with Chinas Premier Li Keqiang (not seen) at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing, China December 15, 2017. REUTERS/Nicolas Asfouri/Pool .”Rocket man now wants to talk to South Korea for first time. .“Perhaps that is good news, perhaps not - we will see!” .Trump has frequently derided Kim as “rocket man.” The U.S. president said sanctions and other pressures were starting to have a big impact on North Korea. .Kim and Trump have exchanged fiery barbs in the last year and the U.S. president has warned that the United States would have no choice but to “totally destroy” North Korea if forced to defend itself or its allies. .North Korea regularly threatens to destroy the United States, South Korea and Japan and tested its most powerful intercontinental ballistic missile in November, which it said was capable of delivering a warhead anywhere in the United States. .South Korea’s Unification Minister Cho Myong-gyon said the offer for high-level talks next Tuesday had been discussed with the United States. Nauert said she was not aware if the matter had been discussed in advance of the South Korean response. .Cho suggested the talks be held at the border village of Panmunjom and said they should be focussed on North Korea’s participation at the Olympics, but other issues would likely arise, including the denuclearisation of North Korea. .“I repeat: The government is open to talking with North Korea, regardless of time, location and form,” Cho said. .Should the talks be held, it would be the first such dialogue since a vice-ministerial meeting in December 2015. .South Korean President Moon Jae-in welcomed Kim’s New Year .address and asked his government to move as quickly as possible to bring North Korea to the Olympics, but he stressed that an improvement in inter-Korean relations “cannot go separately with resolving North Korea’s nuclear programme”. .China, which has persistently urged a return to talks to ease tensions, said recent positive comments from North and South Korea were a good thing. .“China welcomes and supports North Korea and South Korea taking earnest efforts to treat this as an opportunity to improve mutual relations, promote the alleviation of the situation on the Korean peninsula and realise denuclearisation on the peninsula,” Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said.

I’ll try 100 percent to help my team and my team mates.” .SIPG finished second behind perennial Chinese Super League champions Guangzhou Evergrande last season while they were also runners-up in the Chinese FA Cup and semi-finalists in the Asian Champions League. .Coach Andre Villas-Boas left after just one season and has been replaced by his Portuguese compatriot Pereira, a man Hulk knows from his time working under the 49-year-old at Porto. .”I know Pereira well,“ Hulk said. ”He’s a very good coach who is ambitious. He has been keeping us on the right track on a daily basis and I hope his leadership can improve our results. .”Now there’s a great atmosphere in the team. It’s nice to have this kind of atmosphere at the start of the season and it will put us in a good frame of mind going into the New Year. .“Hopefully God will bless us with a great year and better achievements.” .Hulk’s position as the most expensive player in Asia was taken by his compatriot Oscar, who signed for Shanghai from Chelsea last January, providing SIPG with one of the most potent attacking forces on the continent. .The pair are joined by fellow Brazilian Elkeson as well as veteran defender Ricardo Carvalho and Uzbekistan’s Odil Ahmedov as the club’s foreign players. .New rules in the Chinese Super League, however, will allow teams to field no more than three foreigners in each game while forcing coaches to select the same number of Chinese players under the age of 23 as the non-Chinese players in their starting line-up. .The amendment to the regulations is certain to have a major impact on the upcoming campaign, but Hulk believes the added competition for places among the overseas players will beneficial to the team. .“As far as the international competition between the foreign players in the team is concerned, it will be a difficult choice for the coach but it will be a good thing for the team because we have a good pool of players to choose from,” he said. .“What we need to do is perform well in training.” .($1 = 0.8317 euros)', 'output': "[['Hulk', 'PERSON', 'Operate_In', 'Shanghai SIPG', 'ORG'], ['Hulk', 'PERSON', 'Determined_To', 'Deliver', 'SECTOR'], ['Hulk', 'PERSON', 'Focused_On', 'Delivering', 'SECTOR'], ['Hulk', 'PERSON', 'Signed', '55_million_euros', 'ECON_INDICATOR'], ['Hulk', 'PERSON', 'Yet_To_Claim', 'Any_Silverware', 'SECTOR'], ['Hulk', 'PERSON', 'Hope', 'Win_A_Championship', 'SECTOR'], ['Hulk', 'PERSON', 'Try', '100_percent', 'ECON_INDICATOR'], ['Hulk', 'PERSON', 'Joined_By', 'Fellow_Brazilian', 'PERSON'], ['Hulk', 'PERSON', 'Joined_By', 'Veteran_Defender', 'PERSON'], ['Hulk', 'PERSON', 'Joined_By', 'Uzbekistan’s', 'PERSON'], ['Shanghai SIPG', 'ORG', 'Finished', 'Second', 'SECTOR'], ['Shanghai SIPG', 'ORG', 'Runners-Up', 'Chinese_FA_Cup', 'EVENT'], ['Shanghai SIPG', 'ORG', 'Semi_Finalists', 'Asian_Champions_League', 'EVENT'], ['Shanghai SIPG', 'ORG', 'Replaced', 'Andre_Villas-Boas', 'PERSON'], ['Shanghai SIPG', 'ORG', 'Hired', 'Vitor_Pereira', 'PERSON'], ['Hulk', 'PERSON', 'Knows', 'Pereira', 'PERSON'], ['Hulk', 'PERSON', 'Hope', 'Improve', 'SECTOR'], ['Hulk', 'PERSON', 'Believes', 'Added_Competition', 'SECTOR'], ['Hulk', 'PERSON', 'Perform', 'Well_In_Training', 'SECTOR']]", 'category': 'closed_qa'}

{'input': 'Acknowledging his push to broker peace in the Middle East has stalled, President Donald Trump on Tuesday appeared to threaten to cut off U.S. aid money to the Palestinian Authority, asking why the U.S. should make any of these massive future payments when the Palestinians are no longer willing to talk peace..Trump, in a pair of tweets, said the U.S. pays the Palestinians HUNDRED OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS a year and get no appreciation or respect..They dont even want to negotiate a long overdue ... peace treaty with Israel, he wrote..Trump infuriated Palestinians and Muslims across the Middle East when he announced late last year that the U.S. would consider Jerusalem the capital of Israel and move its embassy there, upending decades of U.S. policy and igniting protests..While the Palestinians havent closed the door to a potential deal with Israel, Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas said the announcement had destroyed Trumps credibility as a Mideast peace broker, calling the decision a declaration of withdrawal from the role it has played in the peace process..Tuesdays tweets mark a tacit admission by Trump that his decision to move the U.S. embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem has thrown a wrench into his administrations plans to restart the peace process between Israelis and Palestinians, which he had dubbed the ultimate deal..Trump tasked son-in-law Jared Kushner to restart the effort, and brought his former attorney, Jason Greenblatt, into the White House to lead the negotiations. Trumps Mideast peace team had held meetings with Israeli, Palestinian and Arab leaders for nearly a year ahead of an expected peace proposal..But by recognizing Israels claim to Jerusalem, Trump was seen by the Palestinians as siding with Israel on the most sensitive issue in the conflict. The Palestinians seek east Jerusalem — which Israel captured in 1967 — for their capital..Trump said his decision merely recognized the reality that Jerusalem already serves as Israels capital and wasnt meant to prejudge the final borders of the city..In his tweets, Trump argued his decision had taken Jerusalem, the toughest part of the negotiation, off the table, but Israel, for that, would have had to pay more..When Trump declared Jerusalem to be Israels capital, he insisted, counterintuitively, that the move would improve, not hurt, prospects for clinching a peace deal..In the days after the decision, Trump administration officials said the strategy was based on the notion that Israel had lost faith in the U.S. as a committed partner during the Obama administration. With trust in Washington restored, Netanyahus government would be more inclined going forward to make tough concessions that would ultimately be needed for a peace deal, the U.S. officials argued at the time, and Israeli officials quietly indicated that they could potentially do so..No one spelled out, however, what the Palestinians would receive in return..Trump on Tuesday also issued a threat to cut off foreign aid dollars to an unspecified list of countries that dont reciprocate..Its not only Pakistan that we pay billions of dollars to for nothing, but also many other countries, and others, Trump wrote, appearing to reference a Jan. 1 tweet lambasting Pakistan for failing to do enough to combat terror groups while taking U.S. aid. No more! Trump had tweeted Monday..Trumps language marks a striking departure from decades of bipartisan American practice and reflects Trumps transactional view of global affairs. U.S. leaders of both parties have long utilized foreign assistance dollars — a minor percentage of the overall budget — to promote American interests abroad, alleviate humanitarian crises and support oppressed peoples ..Trumps envoy to the United Nations, U.S. Ambassador Nikki Haley, foreshadowed Trumps warning earlier Tuesday at the U.N. Security Council. Haley said the president doesnt want to give more funds until the Palestinians are willing to come back to the negotiation table..We still very much want to have a peace process. Nothing changes with that. The Palestinians now have to show they want to come to the table, Haley said. As of now, theyre not coming to the table, but they ask for aid. Were not giving the aid. Were going to make sure that they come to the table..Since a Dec. 21 U.N. vote condemning Trumps Jerusalem decision, U.S. officials have been weighing various options for retaliating against the Palestinians for pushing the resolution, which passed by a 128-9 margin..Those options, which were to be discussed by Trumps top national security aides at a meeting next week, included several involving cutting off some or all aid to the Palestinian Authority. Another option would cut funding to the U.N. agency that provides services to the Palestinians in places like Gaza, Jordan and Lebanon..The talks are in their very early stages, with no determination yet of a fixed amount or percentage of assistance to be cut, according to officials familiar with the discussions..However, the officials noted that only a relatively small amount of the more than $220 million that the U.S. was planning on sending to the Palestinians in the current budget year actually goes to the Palestinian Authority. Most of that assistance flows to non-governmental groups that are involved in building civic organizations that promote good governance, anti-corruption efforts, and health and education projects..The officials said one possibility would be to redirect aid from the Palestinian Authority to those groups. Similar proposals were envisioned for the U.N. relief agency for Palestinians, the officials said, noting that Palestinian children in Gaza, Jordan and Lebanon would be disproportionally affected by an immediate and complete cut-off..Chris Gunness, a spokesperson for the U.N. Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian Refugees in the Near East, said it had not been informed of any changes to U.S. funding at this time..One basket of money that is unlikely to be affected is security assistance that helps the Palestinian Authority coordinate police cooperation with Israel, the officials said.

{'input': 'British trade minister Liam Fox said on Wednesday that London would continue to welcome foreign investment, after a U.S. panel rejected a Chinese acquisition of a U.S. money transfer company on national security concerns..Fox was on a visit to China , the latest installment in long-running economic talks between China and Britain , which has taken on new importance for Britain as it looks to re-invent itself as a global trading nation after leaving the European Union in 2019..The U.S. rejection of Chinas Ant Financials acquisition of MoneyGram International Inc is the most high-profile Chinese deal to be torpedoed under the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump ..Asked whether Britain would serve as an alternative destination for such Chinese investment, Fox told Reuters in an interview that he hoped the investment relationship would work in two directions, but that Britain would remain open..Of course, we would look, as other countries would do, at our security issues in terms of investment. But the UK has traditionally been an open country, welcoming of foreign direct investment. And well continue to do that, Fox said..He did not comment specifically on the U.S. panel decision..China is one of the countries with which Britain hopes to sign a free trade pact once it leaves the EU, and London and Beijing have been keen to show that Britains withdrawal from the bloc will not affect ties..Fox said that the issue of Chinas service sector openness was a big issue for Britain, but that there were more options than a post-Brexit free trade agreement (FTA) to get Beijing to open, including specific service sector agreements and mutual recognition deals..There are a whole range of tools in the box.

MoneyGram and Ant Financial also announced that they plan to work together on new strategic initiatives in the remittance and digital payments markets that will help each company achieve its objective of enabling consumers around the world to enjoy better money transfer services..Alex Holmes, Chief Executive Officer of MoneyGram, said, The geopolitical environment has changed considerably since we first announced the proposed transaction with Ant Financial nearly a year ago. Despite our best efforts to work cooperatively with the U.S. government, it has now become clear that CFIUS will not approve this merger. We are disappointed in the termination of this compelling transaction, which would have created significant value for our stakeholders. The MoneyGram Board and management team greatly appreciate the significant time and energy that so many of our colleagues have devoted to trying to complete the transaction..Under the new strategic business cooperation, MoneyGram and Ant Financial will explore and develop initiatives to bring together their capabilities in remittance and digital payments to provide their respective customers with user-friendly, rapid-response and low-cost money transfer services into China, India and the Philippines, among other Asian markets, as well as in the U.S. and other key regions around the world..Mr. Holmes continued, While we are disappointed by this outcome, we are confident in the future of MoneyGram and are excited about the benefits of our future cooperation with Ant Financial.

{'input': 'January 3, 2018 / 12:31 PM / a few seconds ago Kenya betting firm pulls 600 million shillings sports sponsorship over tax row Duncan Miriri 3 Min Read .NAIROBI (Reuters) - A Kenyan online sports betting firm has cancelled 600 million shillings (£4.27 million) in direct annual sponsorship for the country’s main football league and other sports, after the government hiked taxes for such firms by more than four times. .The government increased the tax rate on gross profits for sports betting firms, lotteries and casinos to 35 percent last year, from 7.5 percent, to create a fund for sports, culture and the arts. It says the rapid growth of betting in a loosely regulated environment has hurt the young and vulnerable. .Ronald Karauri, the chief executive of Sportpesa, one of the biggest firms, said they were left with no choice but to cut costs in order to survive. .“All we will have to do is manage our expenditure in terms of our marketing expenses,” he told Reuters on Wednesday. .“We had really committed ourselves to sports in the country so it is a very huge burden for us as a cost.” .Sportpesa has been sponsoring the Kenyan football federation, the country’s premier league, various clubs including last year’s league champions Gor Mahia, the national rugby union and boxing. .Ambrose Rachier, the chairman of Gor Mahia, said the club might be forced to pull out of this year’s Confederation Champions League Cup, a regional competition, due to lack of funds. The team was getting 60 million shillings a year from Sportpesa. .“It is devastating ... We are in mourning,” Rachier said. .The situation was the same at the Kenya Rugby Union, which is losing 120 million shillings a year, used to prepare squads for the international rugby sevens series. .It was also using the cash to pay training and match allowances to its 15-a-side teams, said Richard Omwela, the chairman of the rugby union. .“It is a total shutdown,” he said. “Unless the government steps in and says we will underwrite that, what we possibly will do is tell our suppliers and partners that we can’t meet our obligations.” .Kenyan sports teams have long been beset by poor management and corruption, which have hindered their performance abroad and discouraged fans at home. .In 2016, sports officials were investigated after the team to that year’s Olympic games in Brazil complained of mismanagement of flight and hotel bookings, theft of kits and even the mishandling of the list of accredited participants. .Despite problems in the build up to Rio, the East African nation enjoyed its most successful Olympics, winning six gold medals, six silvers and one bronze, all in track and field.

{'input': 'January 3, 2018 / 5:29 AM / Updated 6 hours ago Former senior Hong Kong police officer jailed for baton assault during democracy protest Chermaine Lee 3 Min Read .HONG KONG (Reuters) - A former senior Hong Kong police officer was sentenced to three months jail on Wednesday for assaulting a passerby with his baton during the city’s massive pro-democracy protests of late 2014. .The “Umbrella Movement” demonstrations which occupied major roads and demanded, in vain, full democracy for the former British colony, was one of the most direct populist challenges to Beijing’s Communist Party leaders since the city came under Chinese rule in 1997. .During the civil disobedience movement that ran for 79 straight days, protesters, sometimes numbering in their thousands, faced off repeatedly with the police who used batons, tear gas and pepper spray -- drawing some criticism for the excessive use of force. .Retired superintendent Frankly Chu, 58, showed no obvious emotion when principal magistrate Bina Chainrai sentenced him to four months jail for assault occasioning actual bodily harm. .This was mitigated to three months given his retirement and the unlikelihood of him reoffending. .Chainrai said the sentence was necessary so that public confidence in the police force could be maintained and that the police had a “duty to uphold standards”. .Chu was filmed hitting a man on the neck with a baton during a protest in the Mong Kok district in 2014, targeting what some deemed to be a high-risk part of the body. Police officers patrol outside a court where retired superintendent Frankly Chu was given a jail term in Hong Kong, China January 3, 2018. REUTERS/Bobby Yip .Chu, however, said during the trial that his use of force had been appropriate and that he was carrying out orders from his superiors to move protesters away from that area. .Chu’s lawyer, Peter Pannu, said his client would appeal. Slideshow (3 Images) .A Hong Kong court last February also sentenced seven policemen to two years behind bars for beating a handcuffed activist during the 2014 protests. The seven have been released on bail pending appeal. .The assaults by the seven policemen, and Chu, were captured on video and widely broadcast, triggering public outrage and tarnishing the reputation of the Hong Kong police force that has sometimes been dubbed “Asia’s finest”. .Police support groups, however, say the officers were only maintaining public order. After the sentencing, around 30 supporters of Chu yelled: “Hong Kong’s judiciary is unfair. Hong Kong police were insulted”. .A University of Hong Kong poll that surveyed over a thousand people shows public satisfaction with the police force’s performance after the Occupy protests were cleared in December 2014 plummeted to the lowest point since the handover right. .The half yearly figure has since risen from 21 percent in the first six months of 2015 to 37 percent in the last six months.
