We acquired these mission critical buildings, where two of the tenants have manufacturing facilities in close proximity, at well-below replacement cost and a combined weighted average lease term of over four years	9377
With the I-20 East submarket possessing one of the lowest vacancy rates in Atlanta as well as limited amount of new supply, we are confident these assets will be strong long-term investments	9378
