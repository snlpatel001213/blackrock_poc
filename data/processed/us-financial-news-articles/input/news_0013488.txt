Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos has made $6.1 billion in just five trading days in 2018 and is now worth $105 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index .
To put that in perspective, the average American household income (which includes married couples) is about $73,000 a year. (The average lifetime income even for college graduates is less than $2 million, according to an Indiana University report .)
To put it another way, the rise in Bezos' fortune makes him worth more than Microsoft founder Bill Gates was ever worth, Bloomberg reports.
