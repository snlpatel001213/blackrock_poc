  
A former Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCHA.MI) executive pleaded guilty on Monday in connection with a U.S. probe into accusations that he made at least $1.5 million (1.07 million pounds) in improper payments to United Auto Workers union officials, the U.S. attorneyâ€™s office in Detroit said. 
Alphons Iacobelli, 58, who was a vice president of employee relations, plead guilty to conspiracy to violate the Labour Management Relations Act and to subscribing a false tax return based on failing to report hundreds of thousands of dollars in income diverted from Fiat, the government said. He was charged in July in U.S. District Court in Detroit with taking part in a conspiracy to pay prohibited money and gifts to union officials.
