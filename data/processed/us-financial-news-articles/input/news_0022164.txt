TUNIS (Reuters) - Tunisian police on Wednesday night clashed with anti-government protesters in at least five towns including one district of the capital Tunis, witnesses said, in a fourth night of demonstrations against austerity measures.
Police fired teargas to disperse crowds in Tunis and Tebourba, a small town outside the capital where one protestor had been killed in Monday.
