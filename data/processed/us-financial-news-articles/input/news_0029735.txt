The decrease from the prior quarter is attributable to the implementation of a rule change by the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) in October 2017 that adversely impacted the Bank’s holdings in SBA investment securities. Income from these bonds significantly reduced as a result of accelerated principal repayments. During the quarter ended December 31, 2017, management reduced the Bank’s holdings in the bonds most impacted by the rule change and partially replaced them with other investment securities to help reduce the impact on future earnings.
Net income for the year ended December 31, 2017 was negatively impacted by the recently enacted Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which reduced the Federal corporate income tax rate to 21% effective January 1, 2018. As a result of the new law, the Bank was required to reduce the carrying value of its deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2017, which resulted in a one-time charge of $210,000 to increase Federal income tax expense during the quarter and year ended December 31, 2017.
CFO Michael Finn stated, “While the recently enacted tax reform law adversely affected the Bank’s fourth quarter earnings, it will reduce tax expense and improve earnings in future periods. During the fourth quarter, management faced a challenge with the SBA rule change previously noted, but we’ve been taking steps to reduce the impact on the Bank’s future earnings and will continue to closely monitor the remaining holdings in SBA investment securities.”
CEO John M. Jelavich commented, “We are pleased with our record earnings for 2017. Notably, our loans and deposits also achieved record levels for our Bank, reflecting our ability to serve our markets. Looking beyond the unevenness of our fourth quarter results, we remain optimistic about 2018. In addition to the core banking momentum we carry into the New Year, we expect the impact of the recently passed tax reform to add to the already strengthening economic climate, which bodes well for new business investment and growth."
