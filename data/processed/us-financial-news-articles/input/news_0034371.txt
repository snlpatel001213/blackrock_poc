LAS VEGAS—The girlfriend of the Las Vegas mass shooter Stephen Paddock isn’t expected to face criminal charges, but investigators are still considering other charges connected to the massacre that left 58 dead, authorities said Friday.
The announcement concerning Marilou Danley, who was overseas at the time of the Oct. 1 attack, came as Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department Sheriff Joseph Lombardo released an 81-page preliminary report on the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history.
