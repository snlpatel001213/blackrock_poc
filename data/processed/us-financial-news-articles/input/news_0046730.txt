DAVOS, Switzerland—President Donald Trump on Thursday said the Palestinians must return to peace talks with Israel to continue receiving U.S. aid, in comments to reporters as he met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
Mr. Trump, in Davos for two days for the World Economic Forum gathering, said he was hopeful for a peace deal between Israel and the Palestinians, but said the Palestinians had “disrespected” the U.S. by refusing to meet with Vice President Mike Pence on his trip to the Middle East earlier this week.
