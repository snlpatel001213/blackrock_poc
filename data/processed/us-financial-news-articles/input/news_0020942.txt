The party had tweeted “Congratulations to Chris Grayling following his appointment as Conservative Party Chairman” before deleting it. 
BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg had also named Grayling, citing two unnamed sources, but later tweeted that another source said immigration minister Brandon Lewis would be the new chairman. Lewis was pictured entering May’s office in Downing Street. 
A spokesman for the party declined to confirm the reports that Grayling, the transport minister, was the new chairman. Reporting by Alistair Smout and Elizabeth Piper
