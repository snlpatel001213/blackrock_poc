WASHINGTON (Reuters) - There is not expected to be an announcement on Thursday of any decision by U.S. President Donald Trump on whether to reimpose sanctions on Iran that were eased under the 2015 nuclear deal, a U.S. official said.
The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said an announcement was likely to come on Friday from the White House.
