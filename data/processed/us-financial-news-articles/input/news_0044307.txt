BEIJING (Reuters) - China’s insurance regulator said on Friday that all overseas investments made by the country’s insurers must be made according to rules set by the central bank and the foreign exchange regulator.
New revised rules on insurance funds usage will take effect in April, Jia Biao, vice head of the capital operation department, told reporters in a briefing in Beijing.
