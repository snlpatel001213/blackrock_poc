SANTA CLARITA, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Bank of Santa Clarita (BSCA) today announced that it reported record levels of earnings in 2017. Earnings for 2017 were $1,835,000, a 34% improvement over 2016 earnings. During 2017’s fourth quarter, the Bank reported net earnings of $390,000, an increase of 42% over the Bank’s net earnings during the fourth quarter of 2016.
In December 2017 the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “TCJA”) was signed into Federal law, and one of the primary provisions of the TCJA was to significantly lower the maximum statutory Federal income tax rate for corporations, including the Bank. Under generally accepted accounting principles, the Bank was required to re-measure its net deferred tax assets and record the effect of that re-measurement, with the result of that adjustment being reflected in 2017, the year the TCJA was enacted. For the Bank, that one-time adjustment amounted to a $201,000 addition to tax expense, which reduced the Bank’s reported net earnings for 2017. Excluding this one-time TCJA adjustment, the Bank’s 2017 earnings would have been $2,036,000, which would represent an increase of 49% over 2016 earnings.
In reviewing 2017 operations, the Bank reported a year-over-year growth in net interest income of 6% and also a reduction in noninterest expenses of 10% (2016 operations included a one-time charge for the termination of a lease on a former branch site, and excluding that 2016 charge, the Bank’s noninterest expenses declined 4%, year-over-year).
The Bank reported total net loans of $221.6 million at December 31, 2017, an increase of 6% over the prior year-end. The Bank also continues to have excellent credit quality in its loan portfolio, as it had no nonaccrual loans at December 31, 2017.
“In the fourth quarter of 2017, the Bank took a tax-related charge, as did most other banks, as a result of the new tax law. In light of this charge, the Bank posted record earnings of $1.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017,” noted Frank Di Tomaso, the Bank’s Chief Executive Officer. He added, “We believe that we continue to be a sound, conservatively-run financial institution, as evidenced by our improved profitability, excellent credit quality and well-capitalized position. We continue to be actively engaged in our community, providing loans and banking services to meet our neighbors’ financial needs. We are also encouraged by the new tax law, which we believe will act as a stimulus for the economy, the Bank and its clients.”
At December 31, 2017, shareholders’ equity totaled $29.2 million and the Bank’s total capital ratio was 13.07%, significantly exceeding the “well capitalized” level prescribed in the applicable capital regulations. The Bank also continues to maintain substantial liquidity positions, retaining significant balances of liquidity on its balance sheet as well as readily available collateralized borrowings and other potential sources of liquidity.
