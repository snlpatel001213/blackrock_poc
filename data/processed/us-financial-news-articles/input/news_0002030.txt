The greater New York area steeled itself for the first winter storm of the season Thursday with up to 12 inches of snow and wind gusts of up to 45 miles an hour forecast for parts of the region. 
As New Yorkâ€™s airports canceled most flights , the subway system, commuter rail agencies and roads remained largely operational despite creeping delays and disruptions. 
Early Thursday, the National Weather Service forecast 8 to 12 inches of snow for most of Long Island and southern Connecticut. In Suffolk County, where blizzard conditions were forecast, snow started falling at a rate of 1 to 2 inches an hour before 8 a.m. ET. 
In New York City, where 5 to 10 inches of snow was predicted, the city closed public schools, suspended alternate side parking and urged residents to use mass transit whenever possible.
