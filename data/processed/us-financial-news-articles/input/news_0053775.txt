Jefferies analysts have isolated their top stock picks for 2018, assembling a master list of favorite ideas for their clients. 
Compiling thoughts from over 20 analysts, Jefferies highlighted "a number of less obvious, less well performing, turnaround-type stocks that ascended the ranks." 
"All of the selected stocks have one thing in common as far as Jefferies analysts are concerned â€“operationally, things can get better from here," the team's Wednesday report read. "Some have seen recent improvements, some have seen recent setbacks, but in all cases, there is a path to greater things driven by factors other than just tax." 
The team mentioned dozens of equities that fit their criteria, complete with price targets and analyst theses. 
Here are some of the stocks Jefferies selected for their upside potential in the next year.
