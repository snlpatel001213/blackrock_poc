Tremont Waters had 15 points, nine assists, eight steals and five rebounds for LSU (12-7, 3-4 Southeastern Conference). Aaron Epps and Daryl Edwards scored 12 points each.
Robert Williams had 20 points, making 10-of-14 shots, and 15 rebounds as A&M outrebounded LSU, 50-30. Tyler Davis had 12 points and 12 rebounds and Jay Chandler scored 10 points.

A&M closed within 12 with 12 minutes left, but Brandon Sampson made a 3-pointer and Waters hit a layup for a 17-point margin.

Davis scored five straight points to cut the margin back to 10 with 4:10 left. Edwards made two free throws and Williams answered with a jumper before Waters’ 3-pointer gave LSU a 73-60 lead with 2:20 remaining.
LSU jumped on top early as Reath’s nine points helped the Tigers build a 25-10 advantage.
A&M scored eight straight points, but Epps scored five as LSU rebuilt the lead to 41-26 at halftime.
