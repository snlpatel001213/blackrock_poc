WASHINGTON, Jan. 25, 2018 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- In response to the attack on Save the Children's office in Jalalabad, Afghanistan, Dr. Jill Biden, Save the Children U.S. Board Chair, on behalf of its Board of Directors today issued the following statement:
"Our hearts are broken, and our prayers are with the victims, our beloved colleagues, and their families.
While Afghanistan is known to be one of the most difficult and dangerous places to work in the world, Save the Children has been dedicated to improving the lives of Afghan children and their families for more than 40 years. Through community-based education and healthcare programs in 16 provinces across the country, we have reached more than 1.4 million children. And when disaster strikes, our staff is ready to respond, ensuring that we quickly meet the needs of the most vulnerable children.
While we are united in our sorrow we remain determined to honor the legacy of those who lost their lives yesterday through the work of Save the Children. Our mission will guide us through this trying time – we will continue to serve the children of the world with hope and courage, and we will continue to defend the safety of the men and women who heed that call."
Save the Children gives children in the United States and around the world a healthy start, the opportunity to learn and protection from harm. We invest in childhood — every day, in times of crisis and for our future. Follow us on Twitter and Facebook .
