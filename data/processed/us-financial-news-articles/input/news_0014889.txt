EUROPEAN RETAILERS, AUTOS IN FOCUS (0656 GMT) Today should be fairly quiet on the company news front, though retailers will once again be in focus as online luxury retailer Yoox-Net-a-Porter is due to give a sales update and H&M&rsquo;s <HMb.ST< December sales will also be watched. German retailer Metro reported flat sales for the Christmas quarter.
Also on the agenda we’ve got Rio Tinto giving an update on Q4 sales and Renault’s full year sales.
On the subject of autos, the sector is going to be in focus as the North American International Auto Show in Detroit gets under way, where carmakers will be unveiling new and redesigned concept vehicles.
One stock under scrutiny will be Carillion, which has just said that the company is to enter into compulsory liquidation with immediate effect as discussions were not successful.
