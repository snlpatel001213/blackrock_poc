A few weeks ago, Major League Soccer announced it was headed to Nashville, Tenn. The league should thank local taxpayers, who will fork over millions to help build a new $275 million stadium for the expansion franchise. Taxpayers gave the team free prime real estate, are contributing an additional $25 million toward the project, and will be on the hook for a portion of the bond debt (and ultimately all the debt if the team canâ€™t generate enough revenue to cover its portion of the tab). 

Stadium subsidies like this are nothing...
