When two U.S.-based activist investors broke-up a $15 billion chemical industry merger between Swiss-based Clariant and U.S. rival Huntsman last year, they claimed to be in it for the long haul—and that they had better plans for the company’s future.
Just three months later they have turned tail and sold their roughly $2.5 billion, near-25% stake in Clariant to Saudi Arabia’s state-backed chemicals company, Sabic, which is key to the country’s efforts to diversify its economy away from dependency on crude oil sales.
