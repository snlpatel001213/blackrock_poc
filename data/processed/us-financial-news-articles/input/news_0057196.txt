MILWAUKEE, Jan. 30, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Koss Corporation (NASDAQ:KOSS), the U.S. based high-fidelity headphone company, has reported its second quarter results for the quarter ended December 31, 2017.
Sales for the second quarter were $5,883,877, which is a 12.02% decrease from sales of $6,687,797 for the same three month period one year ago. The three month net loss was $2,937,721, compared to net income of $140,112 for the second quarter last year. Diluted and basic loss per common share for the quarter was $0.40 compared to income per common share of $0.02 for the three month period one year ago.
"With the reduced corporate tax rate in the new tax law, we recorded a significant tax expense to write down deferred tax assets to their future expected value at the new tax rate in addition to increasing the valuation allowance for deferred taxes," Michael J. Koss Chairman and CEO said today. "This tax expense was approximately $3 million even though we had income before taxes for both the December quarter and the first six months."
Koss also explained that sales were off for the quarter primarily due to a decline in sales to OEM accounts and a large order to South America last year that was not repeated this year. Sales to Europe were up with increased sales into Scandinavia. Mass market sales in the US were higher with better product placement than a year ago.
Sales for the six months ended December 31, 2017, decreased 8.3% from $13,036,503 in the same period last year to $11,950,507 in the current year. The six month net loss was $2,920,221 compared to net income of $224,323 for the same period last year. Diluted and basic loss income was $0.40 for the six months ended December 31, 2017 compared to income per common share of $0.03 for the same six month period one year ago.
"Sales to OEM customers in Asia accounted for a large portion of the decline in sales for the first six months compared to last year." Koss continued, "Sales in the US were up slightly due to increased sales in the mass market."
Koss Corporation markets a complete line of high-fidelity headphones, wireless Bluetooth® speakers, computer headsets, telecommunications headsets, active noise canceling headphones, wireless headphones, and compact disc recordings of American Symphony Orchestras on the Koss Classics® label.
