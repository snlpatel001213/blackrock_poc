Shareholders of record should expect to receive IRS Form 1099-DIV ("1099-DIV") from Computershare, the Company's dividend paying agent. Shareholders of record will receive two 2017 1099-DIVs—one 1099-DIV relating to the Special Distribution paid on January 23, 2018 and an additional 1099-DIV relating to the quarterly dividends paid in 2017 prior to the Special Distribution. "Street name" shareholders should expect to receive their 1099-DIVs from their bank, brokerage firm, or other nominee. The amounts indicated on the 2017 1099-DIVs should be reported on shareholders' 2017 federal income tax returns.
Please note that a substantial portion of the January 23, 2018 Special Distribution is included in the tax allocations for 2017 and is therefore taxable for the 2017 tax year. Approximately 5.3% of the Special Distribution relates to the 2018 tax year. The final tax allocations for 2018 distributions will be provided in January 2019.
Investors are encouraged to seek legal and/or tax professional advice about the specific tax treatment of distributions paid by the Company for the 2017 and 2018 tax years.
