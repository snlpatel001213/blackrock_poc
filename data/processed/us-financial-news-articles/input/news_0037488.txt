(Reuters) - Burnley manager Sean Dyche has signed a new four-and-a-half year deal with the Premier League club which will keep him at Turf Moor until 2022. 
Dyche had been on a rolling yearly contract since joining the club in October 2012 and similar deals have been struck for assistant manager Ian Woan and first-team coach Tony Loughlan. 
The 46-year-old has twice won promotion to the Premier League with the Clarets and after his side secured survival with a 16th place finish last season, he has guided them to their current position of eighth place, winning many admirers. 
“I am quite young in management terms. I am still learning and still improving, I believe, so for my personal reasons, as well, I think it’s the right place to be,” Dyche told the club’s official website (www.burnleyfootballclub.com). 
“It’s a very good environment and I enjoy it and I enjoy the connection I’ve had with this area. There’s lots of work to be done, but I‘m definitely ‘in’ for the work to be done.” 
While the club did not give any financial details of the new deal, the Lancashire Evening Telegraph said that Dyche would be earning 3.5 million pounds a year. 
A former lower division defender, Dyche joined Burnley after spending just over a year in charge of Watford. 
Dyche added to his squad on Tuesday by signing winger Aaron Lennon from Everton. Reporting by Simon Evans; Editing by Christian Radnedge
