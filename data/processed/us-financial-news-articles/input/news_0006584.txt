RICHMOND, Va.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Owens & Minor (NYSE: OMI) today announced organizational updates relating to its pending acquisition of Halyard Health, Inc.’s Surgical & Infection Prevention (S&IP) business, which was announced on November 1, 2017. As part of the integration plan for the S&IP business, Owens & Minor anticipates it will organize into two strategic business units (SBUs): Global Solutions and Global Products. The Global Solutions SBU will contain the majority of Owens & Minor’s legacy business and will focus on distribution, logistics, inventory management, and other value-added solutions. The Global Products SBU will contain the S&IP business along with Owens & Minor’s Proprietary Products business segment. Subsequent to announcing the acquisition, Owens & Minor received notice of early termination of the Hart-Scott-Rodino waiting period on November 29, 2017, and expects the transaction to close in the first quarter of 2018.
Chris Lowery, who served as Senior Vice President & Chief Operating Officer of Halyard Health, Inc. from its spin-off from Kimberly-Clark in November 2014, until December 31, 2017, joined Owens & Minor effective January 3, 2018, as its President, Global Products. During his tenure at Halyard, Lowery was responsible for leading worldwide sales and marketing, research and development, quality assurance, regulatory, and clinical affairs. In anticipation of closing the S&IP transaction, Lowery will initially assist Owens & Minor with integration planning, including establishing the Global Products SBU, which will include the Proprietary Products business. Prior to serving as Halyard Health’s COO, Lowery served as Vice President of Sales and Marketing at Kimberly-Clark Health Care, and before that held several senior marketing and sales roles at Covidien, a global health care products company.
