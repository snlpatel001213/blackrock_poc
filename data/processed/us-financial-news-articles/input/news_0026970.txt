PARIS, Jan 18 (Reuters) - BNP Paribas bank and law firm Weil, Gotshal & Manges LLP, mandated by Franceâ€™s state holding company APE to prepare the privatisation of state lottery Francaise des Jeux, will hand in a report on the operation by mid-February, two sources familiar with the situation told Reuters.
One source said the state could expect to raise between 600 and 800 million euros if it sold a 30 percent stake in FDJ to a casino, foreign lottery operator or gambling consortium.
Both sources said an initial public offering of FDJ was still under consideration. (Reporting by Gilles Guillaume and Maya Nikolaeva; Writing by Geert De Clercq)
