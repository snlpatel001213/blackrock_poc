Jeff Bezos' wealth hit $105.1 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index , passing Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates' previous record from 1999.
Bezos ' net worth nudged upward thanks to a rise in Amazon stock, which is up 6.6 percent year to date.
Bezos first passed $100 billion in November on impressive Black Friday sales. It seems the full holiday shopping season has pushed him to record highs once again.
Gates , once the world's richest man, is now worth $93.3 billion.
The Bloomberg index figures are "based on changes in markets, the economy and Bloomberg reporting," and the numbers are updated at the end of every trading day.
