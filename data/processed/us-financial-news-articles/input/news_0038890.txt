LONDON (Reuters) - The UK business of Interactive Brokers Group ( IBKR.O ) has been fined just over one million pounds for poor market abuse controls and failure to report suspicious client transactions over a one-year period. 
The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said on Thursday it had fined the London-based online broker, which arranges and executes financial transactions for UK clients, for failings in its post-trade systems and controls for the period from February 2014 to February 2015.
