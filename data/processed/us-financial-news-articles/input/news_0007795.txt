ENGLEWOOD, Colo.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Liberty Interactive LLC ("Liberty"), a subsidiary of Liberty Interactive Corporation (Nasdaq: QVCA, QVCB, LVNTA, LVNTB), announced a semi-annual interest payment to the holders of its 3.5% Senior Exchangeable Debentures due 2031 (the "Debentures"). The amount of the payment is $17.50 per $1,000 original principal amount of Debentures.
Under the Indenture for the Debentures, the original principal amount of the Debentures is adjusted in an amount equal to each extraordinary distribution made to holders of the Debentures. Thereafter, the adjusted principal amount is further reduced on each successive semi-annual interest payment date to the extent necessary to cause the semi-annual interest payment to represent the payment of an annualized yield of 3.5% of the adjusted principal amount. This latter adjustment, to the extent it is made by reason of a particular extraordinary distribution that results in an adjustment to the principal amount of the Debentures, takes effect on the second succeeding interest payment date after the payment of that extraordinary distribution.
To date, there have been two extraordinary distributions to holders of the Debentures. On January 10, 2007, Liberty made an extraordinary distribution of $162.6160 per $1,000 original principal amount of Debenture arising from Freescale Semiconductorâ€™s going private transaction. On June 20, 2012, Liberty made an extraordinary distribution of $184.0960 per $1,000 original principal amount of Debenture arising from the acquisition of Motorola Mobility Holdings, Inc. by Google.
Adjustments to the principal amount of the Debentures do not affect the amount of the semi-annual interest payments received by holders of the Debentures, which will continue to be a rate equal to 3.5% per annum of the original principal amount of the Debentures. Below is a detail of the amount of the semi-annual interest payment being made on the Debentures, its allocation between payment of interest and repayment of principal and the revised adjusted principal amount resulting from such payment, per $1,000 original principal amount of the Debentures:

Payments of excess regular cash dividend amounts do not result in adjustments to the principal amount of the Debentures.
The semi-annual interest payment and excess regular cash dividend amount distribution are expected to be made on January 16, 2018 to holders of record of the Debentures on January 1, 2018.
