President Donald Trump landed in Switzerland this morning, and will spend the next two days among the global elite at the World Economic Forum in Davos , where he is expected to advocate for an “America First” agenda in an environment that is antithetical to those principles. 
While Trump’s legislative ideology sets him apart from his counterparts at the conference, he’s got one big thing in common with them: finances. Davos is swarming with millionaires and billionaires. 
Because Trump has never released his tax returns, his exact net worth is somewhat of a question mark, but Forbes estimated it at $3.1 billion in 2017 — down $600 million from the previous year. That would make him America’s first billion president – but at Davos he will be alongside people who have amassed much bigger fortunes. 
Here are some of the people he could run into who are richer than he is, according to net worth estimates calculated by Forbes . Bill Gates
