(Reuters) - U.S. specialty metals makers Arconic Inc said on Monday it would freeze defined benefit pension plans for all 7,900 of its U.S.-based salaried and non-bargained hourly employees, effective April 1.
Arconic said it expects its pre-tax pension-related expense in 2018 to be about $50 million lower than a year earlier.
The company expects its liabilities to fall by about $140 million in the first quarter of 2018 due to the reduction of future benefits.
Arconic said it would also record a pre-tax charge of about $5 million in the first quarter.
