WARSAW, Jan 10 (Reuters) - Current level of interest rates remains beneficial for the Polish economic growth, the Monetary Policy Council reiterated on Wednesday after it decided to keep the cost of money unchanged at 1.5 percent.
The MPC said, however, that the gross domestic productâ€™s dynamics may slow down a little bit in coming quarters after a robust growth in the second half of 2017.
