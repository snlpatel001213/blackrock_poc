While Netflix’s market value hit new records on Monday, the company also disclosed that it took a $39 million write-down for “unreleased content.” 
This “unexpected” hit came from content that the company “decided not to move forward with.” Although Netflix (nflx) did not specify which content it had cut, sources told the Financial Times and CNNMoney that the cost was associated with projects in which Kevin Spacey starred.
