Staples' Chief Executive Officer Shira Goodman is departing the company, The Wall Street Journal reported Friday morning, based on conversations with sources familiar with the matter. 
Goodman began leading the office supply retailer in 2016, shortly after Staples failed to merge with Office Depot. She previously had served as president of Staples' North American operations and has served in "various leadership roles" at Staples since 1992, according to her LinkedIn profile . 
Private-equity firm Sycamore Partners acquired Staples for $6.9 billion late last year, adding to its retail holdings that include Talbots, Coldwater Creek, Hot Topic and Nine West. The goal for Sycamore was to turn the struggling retailer around, with a bigger focus on serving a corporate market. 
Staples' business still has some bright spots and profitable segments, but its stores are increasingly threatened by the likes of Amazon and other retailers that sell less-expensive goods. 
Staples didn't immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment. Sycamore declined to comment.
