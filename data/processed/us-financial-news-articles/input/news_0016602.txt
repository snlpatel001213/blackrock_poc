WASHINGTON, Jan 11 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Thursday he would be “a little bit flexible” on his threat to withdraw from the North American Free Trade Agreement because Mexico is facing a presidential election later this year. 
“I understand that a lot of things are hard to negotiate prior to an election,” Trump said in an interview with the Wall Street Journal. 
Trump also said Mexico can pay for a border wall between the two countries “indirectly” through changes to the trade deal. (Reporting by Eric Beech; Editing by Tim Ahmann)
