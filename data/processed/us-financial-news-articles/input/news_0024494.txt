TOKYO (Reuters) - A stricken Iranian oil tanker, which drifted into Japan’s exclusive economic zone (EEZ) earlier this week, was still in the area as of Friday afternoon and was still on fire, Japan’s Coast Guard said in a statement.
The tanker was located at about 286 km (178 miles) northwest of Sokkozaki on the island of Amami Oshima as of 0700 GMT (1600 JST), drifting southwest at a speed of 2.2 km (1.37 miles) per hour, the Coast Guard said.
