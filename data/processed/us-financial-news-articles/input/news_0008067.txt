CRANBURY, N.J., Jan. 08, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Amicus Therapeutics (Nasdaq:FOLD), a global biotechnology company focused on discovering, developing and delivering novel cutting-edge medicines for rare metabolic diseases, today provided its full-year 2018 strategic outlook and financial guidance.
Key 2017 Accomplishments
Exceeded “Target 300” goal with more than 310 people treated with reimbursed Galafold™ (migalastat) oral precision medicine for Fabry disease at year-end 2017. Full-year 2017 Galafold revenue totaled approximately $36 million. Completed global regulatory submissions for migalastat in Japan (J-NDA), the U.S. (NDA), and other key geographies Established important clinical proof-of-concept for novel, highly differentiated Pompe treatment regimen ATB200/AT2221 on safety, functional outcomes and key disease biomarkers Successfully scaled manufacture of Pompe biologic engineering batches at commercial scale (1,000L) with capacity plans to ensure that entire Pompe population can be served as quickly as possible Strengthened balance sheet with total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $359 million at December 31, 2017 and cash runway into the second half of 2019
John F. Crowley, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Amicus Therapeutics, Inc. stated, “During 2017 we continued to build a leading global rare disease biotech company while advancing our vision to maximize the impact of our medicines for people living with rare diseases. We exceeded our EU launch and regulatory objectives for our Fabry precision medicine Galafold, and we reported clinical data from our Pompe clinical study that lays the foundation for a potential new treatment paradigm for this muscle disease. Throughout 2018 we are poised to create significant additional value for patients and shareholders across our key programs in Fabry and Pompe, and through our focused commitment to advancing and expanding a pipeline of novel medicines for rare metabolic diseases.”
Amicus is focused on five key strategic priorities in 2018:
Double global revenue for Galafold ($75 million - $85 million) Secure approvals for migalastat in Japan and the U.S. Achieve clinical, manufacturing and regulatory milestones to advance ATB200/AT2221 toward global regulatory submissions and approvals as soon as possible Develop and expand preclinical pipeline to ensure at least one new clinical program in 2019 Maintain a strong balance sheet
Mr. Crowley will discuss Amicus' corporate objectives and key milestones in a presentation at the 36th Annual J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference on Tuesday, January 9, 2018 at 8:00 a.m. PT (11:00 a.m. ET). A live webcast of the presentation can be accessed through the Investors section of the Amicus Therapeutics corporate web site at http://ir.amicusrx.com/events.cfm , and will be archived for 90 days.
Full-Year 2017 Financial Summary and 2018 Guidance
Amicus recorded approximately $36 million in full-year 2017 revenue from commercial sales and reimbursed expanded access programs for Galafold. For the full-year 2018 the Company anticipates total Galafold revenue of $75 million to $85 million.
Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities totaled approximately $359 million at December 31, 2017. As previously announced, the Company strengthened the balance sheet during 2017 with a $243.0 million in net proceeds from a follow on public offering in July 2017. The Company expects full-year 2018 net cash spend of between $230 million and $260 million. The current cash position is anticipated to fund ongoing operations into at least the second half of 2019.
Program Highlights
Migalastat for Fabry Disease
Migalastat is an oral precision medicine intended to treat Fabry disease in patients who have amenable genetic mutations. Regulatory authorities in the European Union, Switzerland, Israel, Canada, Australia, and South Korea have granted full approval for migalastat under the trade name Galafold. The EU approval may serve as the basis for regulatory approvals in more than two-thirds of the global Fabry market that is outside the U.S. In the U.S., Amicus submitted a new drug application (NDA) to the FDA in December 2017 to seek approval of migalastat.
Amicus is committed to advancing the highest quality therapies for all people living with Fabry disease. For people with non-amenable mutations who are not eligible for migalastat as an oral precision medicine, the Company has established initial preclinical proof-of-concept for a novel Fabry ERT (ATB101) co-formulated with migalastat as part of our CHART ® platform.
Global Fabry Updates:
310+ patients (naïve and ERT-switch) on reimbursed Galafold as of December 31, 2017 Total full-year 2017 revenue of $36 million from global commercial sales and expanded access programs (EAPs) Pricing and reimbursement secured in 15 countries Approvals secured in EU, Australia, Canada, Israel, South Korea and Switzerland Approvals pending in Japan, U.S. and other key geographies
Anticipated Milestones:
FDA acceptance of U.S. NDA for filing (1Q18) Regulatory decision on Japanese J-NDA (1H18) Total full-year 2018 revenue guidance of $75 million to $85 million ATB101 co-formulated with migalastat advancing toward the clinic in 2019
ATB200/AT2221 for Pompe Disease
ATB200/AT2221 is a novel treatment paradigm that consists of ATB200, a unique recombinant human acid alpha-glucosidase (rhGAA) enzyme with optimized carbohydrate structures, particularly mannose-6 phosphate (M6P), to enhance uptake, co-administered with AT2221, a pharmacological chaperone. Throughout 2017, Amicus presented a cascade of positive data from an ongoing global Phase 1/2 clinical study ( ATB200-02 ) to evaluate safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamics (PD) of ATB200/AT2221 across ambulatory ERT-switch patients (Cohort 1), non-ambulatory ERT-switch patients (Cohort 2), and ERT-naïve patients (Cohort 3).
Amicus continues to assemble the highest quality data package and to scale up manufacturing to meet the needs of the Pompe community. The Company is in the midst of a series of collaborative discussions with U.S. and EU regulators regarding the best and fastest pathway forward for this novel treatment option, and continues to anticipate a Pompe regulatory pathway update in the first half of 2018.
Pompe Program Updates:
Data collection underway in a retrospective natural history study (POM-002) Prospective observational study (POM-003) initiated GMP production of ATB200 commenced at the large commercial scale (1,000 Liters) FDA agreement reached on comparability between 250L scale and 1000L engineering batches FDA agreement reached on testing strategy for demonstrating comparability between 250L scale and 1000L GMP batches
Anticipated Upcoming Pompe Program Milestones:
Expansion of ongoing ATB200-02 clinical study to include four to six additional ambulatory ERT-switch patients A
