PHILADELPHIA, Jan. 25, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Brandywine Realty Trust (NYSE: BDN) today reported its financial and operating results for the three and twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2017.
Management Comments
"The final quarter of 2017 was very active for Brandywine and we finished the year achieving or exceeding many of our business goals," stated Jerry Sweeney, President and Chief Executive Officer for Brandywine Realty Trust. "Our fourth quarter operating metrics allowed us to exceed our rental rate mark-to-market and tenant retention while keeping our capital costs down. We are also pleased to announce a strong start to 2018 with the sale of our interests in evo at Cira Centre South for $197.5 million, a student housing project located in Philadelphia, in which we had a 50% ownership interest. The sale represents another very successful joint venture development project generating a $25.3 million gain and generating over a 20% annual rate of return on our invested equity. We also took advantage of the favorable public debt market to raise $550 million of unsecured bonds and prepaid $325 million of 2018 bonds, which lowered our average borrowing cost to 4.0% and lengthened our weighted-average debt maturities to 7.7 years. In addition, we utilized our continuous equity offering program to raise $51.6 million at an average price of $18.19 per share. These transactions demonstrate our priority to continually improve our balance sheet metrics and financial position and we have now pre-funded all of our 2018 balance sheet obligations. Based on our sale of evo and equity issuance, we are adjusting our 2018 FFO guidance from $1.36-$1.46 per share to $1.33-$1.43 per share."

Joint Venture Activity
On January 10, 2018, the evo at Cira Centre South Venture, a real estate venture in which we owned a 50% interest, sold its 347-unit residential property in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, at a gross sales price of $197.5 million. We received net cash proceeds of $43.0 million after closing costs and related debt payoffs and recorded a gain of $25.3 million.
On January 5, 2018, we exchanged our 20% interest in Seven Tower Bridge, a real estate venture which owns an undeveloped land parcel in Conshohocken, Pennsylvania encumbered by $14.6 million of debt for the remaining 35% interest in Four Tower Bridge, a real estate venture which owns an office property containing 86,021 square feet in Conshohocken, Pennsylvania encumbered by $9.7 million of debt. The estimated gain on the transaction is $9.7 million.
As previously announced, on October 18, 2017, our joint venture in Austin, Texas, a real estate venture in which we own a 50% interest, sold five office portfolios containing an aggregate of approximately 1,164,500 square feet located in Austin, Texas for a gross sales price of $333.3 million. These properties were encumbered with $151.4 million of first mortgage financing. After closing costs and related debt payoffs, we received net cash proceeds totaling approximately $86.4 million. These properties were 86% occupied and 95% leased at September 30, 2017. Net cash proceeds were used to lower the outstanding balance on our unsecured line of credit. As a result of these property sales, we incurred a one-time charge of approximately $1.3 million for the early extinguishment of debt and recorded a net gain totaling $52.2 million.
Dispositions
On November 22, 2017, we completed the previously announced sale of five buildings in Newtown Square, Pennsylvania for $42.0 million. The buildings total approximately 253,000 square feet and we received net cash proceeds of $40.5 million and recorded a gain of $19.6 million. Net cash proceeds were used to lower the outstanding balance on our unsecured line of credit.
As previously announced, we completed the sale of a 150,000 square foot office building located at 630 Allendale Road in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania for $17.5 million. We received net cash proceeds of $16.6 million and recorded a gain of $3.6 million. Net cash proceeds were used to lower the outstanding balance on our unsecured line of credit.
Development/Redevelopment Acquisitions
Schuylkill Yards/One Drexel Plaza
As previously announced, on October 13, 2017, we acquired a leasehold interest in an office building known as One Drexel Plaza in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, containing approximately 283,000 rentable square feet for a gross purchase price of $35.0 million. The acquisition represents an investment in our Schuylkill Yards development and the property will be repositioned over the next 12-18 months. The acquisition was funded from borrowings under our unsecured line of credit.
Austin, Texas Development
As previously announced, on October 2, 2017, we signed a 165,000 square foot, 10-year lease for a build-to-suit property located in our project at Four Points in Austin, Texas. We commenced construction on the 100% pre-leased building in October 2017. Estimated project costs total $48.2 million, with delivery anticipated in the first quarter 2019. We expect to fund the project with available cash balances and/or our unsecured line of credit.
Guaranteed Note Transaction Highlights
On November 17, 2017, we issued $450.0 million of 3.95% ten-year guaranteed notes and $100.0 million 3.95% guaranteed notes due February 2023, realizing net proceeds of approximately $544.5 million. The $100.0 million of 3.95% guaranteed notes due February 2023 were issued at approximately 102.5% of their principal amount resulting in an effective yield to maturity of 3.40% and will be additive to the $250.0 million guaranteed notes that were issued in December 2012 with the same maturity date.
On November 16, 2017, we completed a $113.4 million tender offer of our 4.95% Guaranteed Notes due April 2018 (the "2018 Notes") and on December 18, 2017, we redeemed $211.6 million of 2018 Notes not previously retired through the tender offer.
As a result of the above transactions, we incurred approximately $4.7 million, or $0.03 per diluted share, of net one-time charges primarily related to the $3.9 million write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs and redemption costs associated with the early redemption of our 2018 Notes and $0.8 million of incremental interest related to the make-whole provisions of our 2018 Notes.
2017 Finance / Capital Markets Activity
During the fourth quarter of 2017 and the first quarter of 2018, we issued approximately 2.9 million shares under our continuous equity offering program raising $51.6 million in net proceeds.
We have no outstanding balance on our $600.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility as of December 31, 2017.

Forward-Looking Statements
Estimates of future earnings per share, FFO per share, common share dividend distributions and certain other statements in this release constitute "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our and our affiliates' actual results, performance, achievements or transactions to be materially different from any future results, performance, achievements or transactions expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Such risks, uncertainties and other factors relate to, among others: our ability to lease vacant space and to renew or relet space under expiring leases at expected levels; competition with other real estate companies for tenants; the potential loss or bankruptcy of major tenants; interest rate levels; the availability of debt, equity or other financing; risks of acquisitions, dispositions and developments, including the cost of construction delays and cost overruns; unanticipated operating and capital costs; our ability to obtain adequate insurance, including coverage for terrorist acts; dependence upon certain geographic markets; and general and local economic and real estate conditions, including the extent and duration of adverse changes that affect the industries in which our tenants operate. The declaration and payment of future dividends (both timing and amount) is subject to the determination of our Board of Trustees, in its sole discretion, after considering various factors, including the Company's financial condition, historical and forecast operating results, and available cash flow, as well as any applicable laws and contractual covenants and any other relevant factors. The Company's practice regarding payment of dividends may be modified at any time and from time to time. Additional information on factors which could impact us and the forward-looking statements contained herein are included in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016. We assume no obligation to update or supplement forward-looking statements that become untrue because of subsequent events except as required by law.
Non-GAAP Supplemental Financial Measures
We compute our financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Although FFO and NOI are non-GAAP financial measures, we believe that FFO and NOI calculations are helpful to shareholders and potential investors and are widely recognized measures of real estate investment trust performance. At the end of this press release, we have provided a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure.
Funds from Operations (FFO)
We compute FFO in accordance with standards established by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (NAREIT), which may not be comparable to FFO reported by other REITs that do not compute FFO in accordance with the NAREIT definition, or that interpret the NAREIT definition differently than us. NAREIT defines FFO as net income (loss) before non-controlling interests and excluding gains (losses) on sales of depreciable operating property, impairment losses on depreciable consolidated real estate, impairment losses on investments in unconsolidated real estate ventures and extraordinary items (computed in accordance with GAAP); plus real estate related depreciation and amortization (excluding amortization of deferred financing costs), and after similar adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures. Net income, the GAAP measure that we believe to be most directly comparable to FFO, includes depreciation and amortization expenses, gains or losses on property sales, extraordinary items and non-controlling interests. To facilitate a clear understanding of our historical operating results, FFO should be examined in conjunction with net income (determined in accordance with GAAP) as presented in the financial statements included elsewhere in this release. FFO does not represent cash flow from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP) and should not be considered to be an alternative to net income (loss) (determined in accordance with GAAP) as an indication of our financial performance or to be an alternative to cash flow from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP) as a measure of our liquidity, nor is it indicative of funds available for our cash needs, including our ability to make cash distributions to shareholders.
Net Operating Income (NOI)
NOI is a financial measure equal to net income available to common shareholders, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, plus corporate general and administrative expense, depreciation and amortization, interest expense, non-controlling interest in the Operating Partnership and losses from early extinguishment of debt, less interest income, development and management income, gains from property dispositions, gains on sale from discontinued operations, gains on early extinguishment of debt, income from discontinued operations, income from unconsolidated joint ventures and non-controlling interest in property partnerships. In some cases we also present NOI on a cash basis, which is NOI after eliminating the effects of straight-lining of rent and deferred market intangible amortization. NOI presented by us may not be comparable to NOI reported by other REITs that define NOI differently. NOI should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of our performance or to cash flows as a measure of the Company's liquidity or its ability to make distributions. NOI is a useful measure for evaluating the operating performance of our properties, as it excludes certain components from net income available to common shareholders in order to provide results that are more closely related to a property's results of operations. NOI is used internally to evaluate the performance of our operating segments and to make decisions about resource allocations. We concluded that NOI provides useful information to investors regarding our financial condition and results of operations, as it reflects only the income and expense items incurred at the property level, as well as the impact on operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs and acquisition and development activity on an unlevered basis.
Core Portfolio
Our core portfolio is comprised of our wholly-owned properties, excluding any properties currently in development, re-development or re-entitlement.
