MOSCOW, Jan 10 (Reuters) - U.S.-based Russian media outlet RIA Global LLC will be required to register as a foreign agent in the U.S., its partner media company Sputnik said on Wednesday, citing a letter from the U.S. Justice Department.
RIA Global, which produces content for Sputnik’s news platforms, is staffed by American journalists and registered in the country, Sputnik said.
Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a law last month that allows the authorities to designate foreign media outlets as “foreign agents” in response to what Moscow said was unacceptable U.S. pressure on Russian media.
