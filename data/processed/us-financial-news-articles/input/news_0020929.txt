TOKYO, Jan 9 (Reuters) - The Nikkei share average hit a 26-year high on Tuesday, helped by gains on Wall Street during a Japanese holiday and as a weaker yen lifted investorsâ€™ appetite for risk.
The Nikkei was up 0.9 percent at 23,952.61 in early trade, its highest since November 1991. Japanese markets were closed on Monday for a national holiday.
The broader Topix was 0.7 percent higher at 1,892.71 after touching 1,895.26, a level not seen since June 1991. (Reporting by Ayai Tomisawa; Editing by Chris Gallagher)
