Verizon Communications Inc. has struck a wide-ranging agreement with the National Basketball Association that extends the telecommunications giant’s relationship with the league beyond streaming games and into content creation as well as virtual and augmented-reality fan experiences. 
As part of the deal, Verizon VZ, +0.15% will now be able to offer the NBA’s “League Pass” subscription package of more than 1,100 regular season games on all its platforms through its Yahoo Sports. Verizon’s price tag for the package is $99 a season, 50% less than what it costs to buy it through a traditional pay-TV distributor. Verizon also receives some ad inventory to sell. 
Currently Verizon distributes “League Pass” only on its go90 platform. As part of the deal, Verizon will gain mobile carrier exclusivity, meaning that no other carrier will be able to offer League Pass subscriptions. Non-Verizon users who have League Pass subscriptions will be able to access through Yahoo Sports. 
The deal includes tablet and computer rights as well as mobile rights to games. 
Terms of the new agreement were not disclosed but a person familiar with the situation said it is in the $400 million range, which is similar to the previous deal between the two. Verizon and Yahoo are also investing $25 million in a technology fund to develop new fan experiences for watching games.
