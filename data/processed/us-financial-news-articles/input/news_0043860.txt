LONDON, Jan 25 (Reuters) - European TV group Sky posted a 5 percent rise in first-half revenue to 6.7 billion pounds ($9.6 billion) and said it had attracted 365,000 new customers, taking its base to 22.9 million.
Reporting two days after Rupert Murdochâ€™s bid for the company was ruled to be not in the public interest, Sky said it remained confident in its strategy, underpinned by its range of entertainment and sports content. ($1 = 0.7008 pounds) (Reporting by Paul Sandle, editing by James Davey)
