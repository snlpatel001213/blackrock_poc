LAGOS, Jan 25 (Reuters) - Nigerian stocks shed 1.57 percent on Thursday to drop for the fourth straight session after shares in the relatively liquid banking sector sank. 
Stock dropped to 43,281 points by mid-session, spooked partly by a political impasse which could threaten the central bankâ€™s independence and as investors booked profit from recent rallies. (Reporting by Chijioke Ohuocha Editing by Jeremy Gaunt)
