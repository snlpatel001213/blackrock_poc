ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkish airstrikes struck 108 targets belonging to Kurdish militants, the army said in a statement on Saturday, hours after it launched an operation against a U.S.-based Kurdish militia in Syria’s Afrin province.
The Turkish military did not say whether the targets were all in Syria’s Afrin’s province.
A Reuters cameraman at the border with Syria earlier reported seeing warplanes fly overheard, carrying out strikes on the Syrian side.
