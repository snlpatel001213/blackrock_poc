(Reuters) - Medtronic Plc ( MDT.N ) on Monday unveiled a restructuring plan that it expects will help it save $500 million to $700 million annually over the next five years. 
The company said it expected annual gross run-rate savings of over $3 billion by 2022 from the program. 
The company also said it expected total expenses from the restructuring to be at between $1.6 billion and $1.8 billion from 2018 to 2022. 
The plan was announced during a presentation at the J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference. 
Chief Executive Omar Ishrak said the company was confident about mid-single digit revenue growth in the short term. 
Medtronic said in November it expected revenue growth to be in the range of 4-5 percent in fiscal 2018, and adjusted earnings to increase 9 to 10 percent. 
Evercore ISI analyst Vijay Kumar said investors had been skeptical about the forecast, given industry trends in the first half of the year. Reporting by Manas Mishra in Bengaluru; Editing by Maju Samuel
