 57 AM / Updated 9 minutes ago Storm disrupts traffic at Amsterdam's Schiphol airport   
AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - A storm disrupted air traffic at Amsterdam’s Schiphol airport on Wednesday, with many flights canceled or delayed. 
Airlines canceled 176 out of a total of more than 1,200 incoming and outgoing flights on Wednesday morning, a spokesman for the Dutch national airport said. 
That number was expected to rise, as the storm would grow stronger during the day, with wind gusts reaching speeds of up to 120 kph (75 mph). 
Flights that were not canceled faced an average delay of about an hour, the airport said. 
Schiphol is Europe’s third busiest airport in number of total passengers per year, after London Heathrow and Paris Charles de Gaulle. Reporting by Bart Meijer;
