NEWPORT BEACH, Calif., Jan. 25, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- DynTek, Inc. (OTC:DYNE) , a leading provider of professional technology services , today announced results for its fiscal year 2018 second quarter ended December 31, 2017.
Second Fiscal Quarter 2018 Ended December 31, 2017
DynTek reported revenues of $37,918,000 for the second fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $1,819,000 or 5.0%, from $36,099,000 in the prior year second quarter ended December 31, 2016. Gross profit was $6,501,000 for the second fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $773,000 or 13.5%, from $5,728,000 in the prior year second quarter ended December 31, 2016. This quarter over prior year quarter revenue and gross profit increase is primarily due to large product orders in the Las Vegas region and a focus on higher margin services.
Total operating expenses were $5,567,000 in the second fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $314,000 or 6.0%, as compared to $5,253,000 in the prior year second quarter ended December 31, 2016. This quarter over prior year quarter increase is primarily due to increased selling expenses in relation to increased revenues.
DynTek reported EBITDA of $1,026,000 for the second fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $461,000 or 81.6%, as compared to $565,000 in the prior year second quarter. Net income was $470,000 for the second fiscal quarter of 2018, or $0.20 per diluted share, an increase of $375,000, 391.2% and $0.16 per diluted share, over the net income of $96,000 and $0.04 per diluted share in the second fiscal quarter of 2017. The increases in EBITDA and net income as compared to prior year second quarter are primarily attributable to higher revenues and gross profit.
Year-to-Date Period Ended December 31, 2017
DynTek reported revenues of $85,911,000 for the six months ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $20,084,000 or 30.5%, from $65,827,000 in the prior six months ended December 31, 2016. Gross profit was $15,139,000 for the six months ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $4,133,000 or 37.6%, from $11,006,000 in the prior year six months ended December 31, 2016. These increases in year over year revenue and gross profit are primarily attributable to the quantity of large product orders in the North East and Las Vegas districts.
Total operating expenses were $13,893,000 in the six months ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $3,808,000 or 37.8%, as compared to $10,085,000 in the prior year six months ended December 31, 2016. This increase over prior year to date is due to higher stock compensation expense primarily related to the Company’s stock option buyback charge of $1,389,000 in the first fiscal quarter of 2018, and higher selling expenses in relation to increased revenue.
DynTek reported EBITDA of $3,056,000 for the six months ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $1,947,000 or 175.5%, as compared to $1,109,000 in the prior year six months. Net income was $549,000 for the six months ended December 31, 2017, or $0.23 per diluted share, an increase of $367,000, 202.0% and $0.16 per diluted share, over the net income of $182,000 and $0.07 per diluted share in the prior six months ended December 31, 2016.
“Our results are a clear indicator that our team is executing on our strategic plan with a focus on delivering higher-margin solutions,” said Ron Ben-Yishay, DynTek’s chief executive officer. “Cybersecurity products and services continue to be a key catalyst to our growth as our customers look for ways to prevent and detect security threats in their environments.”
EBITDA
The Company defines EBITDA as net income from operations before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, and stock-based compensation. Other companies may calculate EBITDA differently. Although EBITDA is a widely used financial indicator of a company's ability to service debt, it is not a recognized measure for financial statement presentation under generally accepted accounting procedures (GAAP). EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as superior or as an alternative to net income or to cash flows from operating activities as determined in accordance with GAAP. Nonetheless, the Company believes that EBITDA provides useful supplemental information for investors and others to measure operating performance, especially in situations where a company has significant non-cash operating expenses that are not indicative of core business operating results. EBITDA is widely used in the IT services industry to analyze comparable company performance, and management of the Company also uses EBITDA, in addition to GAAP information, as a measure of operating performance for assessing its business units.
