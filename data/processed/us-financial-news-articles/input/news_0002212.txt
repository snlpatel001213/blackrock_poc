Fairplane said on Tuesday it had filed legal cases to have the insolvency proceedings for budget airline Niki shifted to Austria from Germany, in a move that could endanger the sale of the Air Berlin ( AB1.DE ) unit to Britain’s IAG ( ICAG.L ). 
A court in Berlin’s Charlottenburg must now decide whether to reverse its Dec. 13 decision opening insolvency proceedings for Niki or to pass on the case to a higher court. 
An Austrian court has meanwhile received a request to open insolvency proceedings for Niki in Austria, a spokesman for the Korneuburg court said on Wednesday, adding it would take the court until next week to assess the matter.
