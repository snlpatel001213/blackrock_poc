(Reuters) - U.S. stocks advanced on Monday as each of Wall Street’s main scored records in the wake of a deal by U.S. senators to end the federal government shutdown.
Legislation to renew federal funding to the government cleared a procedural hurdle in the Senate and was expected soon to pass votes in the Senate and House of Representatives, allowing government to re-open through Feb 8.
“You would think something like the threat of a government shutdown or an actual government shutdown would serve as a catalyst to spook some weaker holders out of the market,” said Eric Marshall, portfolio manager and director of research at Hodges Capital Management in Dallas, Texas.
“That hasn’t happened, which speaks to underlying strength of what we’re seeing right now in equity markets.”
