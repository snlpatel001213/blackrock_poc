Bitcoin’s tremendous drop in the past 24 hours is having a domino effect—on Ripple, Ethereum , and pretty much every other cryptocurrency that’s traded. 
Massive selloffs, for reasons that are not yet clear, are resulting in drops of 15 to 30% for the 100 top digital currencies, as ranked by CoinMarketCap . But even amidst the crash (the first since last December ), there are a few cryptocurrencies that are eking out gains today. 
As of 9 a.m. ET, two digital currencies were showing notable gains on Tuesday. Neblio, a coin tied to a blockchain developer platform that aims to build decentralized applications and services, was up 12%, while Gas, which ties in with the Neo smart contracts ecosystem , saw gains of 9%. 
Both cryptocurrencies were off their highs, though. 
Two more, meanwhile, were managing to stay in positive territory, though just barely. Cryptonex was up 4%. And the mysterious Tether was up 1.3%. 
On Monday, Bloomberg reported that China—which already banned cryptocurrency exchanges last year—is stepping up actions against other online and app-based services that offer exchange-like functionality. 
Monday also saw reports emerge that BlackWallet , a provider of digital wallet services, suffered a clever attack that allowed someone to make off with hundreds of thousands of “lumens”—the virtual coin used by a system called Steller—that had a total value of more than $400,000. 
Of course, given the selloff and the overall volatility of the sector, there’s no guarantee that any of these cryptocurrencies will remain in positive territory for any length of time. SPONSORED FINANCIAL CONTENT
