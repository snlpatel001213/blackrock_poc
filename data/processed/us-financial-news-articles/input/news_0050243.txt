NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India’s economy should grow between 7 percent and 7.5 percent in the upcoming fiscal year that begins on April 1, the finance ministry will say in its pre-budget Economic Survey on Monday, financial newswire Newsrise reported citing a source. 
The annual survey, set to be presented in Parliament later on Monday, comes ahead of Finance Minister Arun Jaitley’s annual budget that is set to be presented on Thursday. 
The forecast comes after the government this month lowered its GDP growth forecast for the year ending March 2018 to 6.5 percent, the weakest pace in four years. Writing by Euan Rocha and Sanjeev Miglani
