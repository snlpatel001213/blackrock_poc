“We are very proud of the sale of Walnut Village and our other two dispositions in the last 45 days; Villas on Bell in Phoenix, AZ and Village at Fair Oaks in Sacramento, CA. All of these properties were purchased pre-recession, and had positive cash flow throughout the downturn. We pride ourselves in our conservative underwriting and deal structure of modest leverage coupled with a debt coverage ratio (DCR) typically in the 200-300% range. The returns are in line with our 40-year multifamily track record of success, as demonstrated by our loyal following and rollover from all three assets,” said Steve King, Vice President of RK Properties .
