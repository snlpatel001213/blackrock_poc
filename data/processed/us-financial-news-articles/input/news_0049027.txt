ATHENS (Reuters) - Incumbent Nicos Anastasiades was leading Cyprus’s presidential election on Sunday, exit polls showed, but is likely to fall short of an outright majority and face a run-off on Feb. 4. 
An exit poll for public broadcaster CyBC put Anastasiades in the lead with between 38 percent and 42 percent of the vote, followed by left-wing independent Stavros Malas on 27-31 percent. 
Centrist Nikolas Papadopoulos was seen taking between 21.5 percent and 24.5 percent of the vote. The poll was based on an 80 percent sample. 
Other stations gave a mixed picture, suggesting the vote was too close to call. 
The two leading candidates to emerge from Sunday’s election will have to seek support from the seven other candidates ahead of the Feb. 4 run-off vote. Reporting By Michele Kambas; Editing by David Goodman
