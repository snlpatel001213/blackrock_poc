(Adds Quote: s, table) KIEV, Jan 10 (Reuters) - Ukraine's 2018 grain harvest is likely to decrease 2 percent from a year ago to 61.1 million tonnes due to a smaller output of wheat, analyst UkrAgroConsult said on Wednesday. Wheat output is likely to decrease to 25.1 million tonnes this year from 26.1 million in 2017 despite a larger sowing area, the consultancy said in a statement. "Our basic scenario envisages possible losses of winter wheat plantings at most at 5-6 percent, or up to 300,000 hectares and a yield at the three-year average," UkrAgroConsult said. The 300,000 hectare loss is equivalent to about 741,000 acres. UkrAgroConsult said that the area of wheat plantings rose by around 2 percent and that wheat sprouted at 99.8 percent of the area.
