MONTREAL (Reuters) - Mexican Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo said on Monday that negotiators from the United States, Canada and Mexico have made enough progress in the talks to revamp NAFTA to be able to conclude the negotiations soon.
“For the next round, we will still have substantial challenges to overcome. Yet the progress made so far puts us on the right track to create landing zones to conclude the negotiation soon,” said Guajardo.
