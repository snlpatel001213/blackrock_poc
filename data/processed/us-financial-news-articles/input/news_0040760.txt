SUNNYVALE, Calif., Jan. 23, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Accuray Incorporated (NASDAQ: ARAY) today reported financial results for the second fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2017.
Fiscal Second Quarter Highlights
Revenue increased 15 percent year-over-year to $100.3 million driven by product revenue growth of 33 percent Gross orders were $77.9 million; net orders were $52.6 million. Ending backlog increased 10 percent year-over-year to $470.5 million Gross margin expanded approximately 340 basis points year-over-year to 39.2 percent driven by improvements in product gross margins Entered a $40 million term loan to facilitate retirement of the remaining February 2018 convertible debt, which could reduce potential share dilution to the extent settled with cash
"We have made solid progress towards achieving consistent operating performance during the first half of the fiscal year and we believe we are well on track to achieve our fiscal 2018 guidance, which was originally provided in August," said Joshua H. Levine, president and chief executive officer. "Our 33 percent year-over-year product revenue growth during the second quarter was primarily driven by solid implementation of our strategies to improve distributor order to revenue conversion and increased Radixact contribution. As the fiscal year progresses, we believe that we will see the initial signs of commercial momentum in the U.S., which could enable us to expand our growth rate in fiscal 2019. We are building this momentum through the market's increased recognition of the clinical benefits of our radiation therapy solutions."
Fiscal Second Quarter Results
Total revenue was $100.3 million compared to $87.5 million in the prior fiscal year second quarter. Product revenue totaled $47.1 million compared to $35.4 million in the prior fiscal year second quarter, while service revenue totaled $53.2 million compared to $52.1 million in the prior fiscal year second quarter. The increase in product revenue was primarily due to improved backlog conversion of orders to revenue from the EIMEA and APAC regions.
Total gross profit for the 2018 fiscal second quarter was $39.4 million or 39.2 percent of sales, comprised of product gross margin of 43.0 percent and service gross margin of 35.9 percent. This compares to total gross profit of $31.4 million or 35.9 percent of sales, comprised of product gross margin of 35.1 percent and service gross margin of 36.4 percent for the prior fiscal year second quarter. The increase in product gross margin was due to product volume and mix, as well as intangible amortization expiring in the fourth quarter of the prior fiscal year.
Operating expenses were $40.4 million, an increase of 11 percent compared with $36.2 million in the prior fiscal second quarter. The increase is primarily due to investments in research and development.
Net loss was $4.7 million, or $0.06 per share, for the 2018 fiscal second quarter, compared to a net loss of $9.4 million, or $0.11 per share, for the 2017 fiscal second quarter.
Adjusted EBITDA for the 2018 fiscal second quarter was $4.8 million, compared to $1.8 million in the prior fiscal year second quarter.
Cash, cash equivalents, investments and short-term restricted cash were $106.1 million as of December 31, 2017 compared to $94.4 million as of September 30, 2017.
In December 2017, the company entered a $40 million term loan while concurrently reducing the borrowing facility under its existing revolving loan by $20 million. As previously announced, the company intends to use the net proceeds of the term loan, combined with existing cash on hand, to retire its 3.50% Series A convertible senior notes due February 1, 2018.
Fiscal Six Month Results
For the six months ended December 31, 2017, gross product orders totaled $133.6 million compared to $128.8 million for the same prior fiscal year period.
Total revenue for the six months ended December 31, 2017, was $191.3 million compared to $174.0 million in the prior fiscal year period. Product revenue totaled $86.0 million compared to $71.0 million in the prior fiscal year period, while service revenue totaled $105.3 million compared to $103.0 million in the prior fiscal year period. The increase in product revenue is primarily related to backlog conversion of orders to revenue from the EIMEA, APAC, and Japan regions. Service revenue increased modestly due to the continued install base expansion.
Total gross profit for the six months ended December 31, 2017, was $77.5 million or 40.5 percent of sales, comprised of product gross margin of 43.1 percent and service gross margin of 38.4 percent. This compares to total gross profit of $62.7 million or 36.1 percent of sales, comprised of product gross margin of 34.8 percent and service gross margin of 36.9 percent for the same prior fiscal year period. The increase in product gross margin stemmed from higher sales unit volume, lower intangible amortization as well as product and channel mix.
Operating expenses were $80.5 million, an increase of 9 percent compared with $74.1 million in the prior fiscal year period. The increase is primarily due to investments in research and development as well as G&A.
Net loss was $14.1 million, or $0.17 per share, for the six months ended December 31, 2017, compared to a net loss of $19.3 million, or $0.24 per share, for the prior fiscal year period.
Adjusted EBITDA for the six months ended December 31, 2017 was $7.9 million, compared to $2.9 million in the prior fiscal year period.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Accuray has supplemented its GAAP net loss with a non-GAAP measure of adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and stock-based compensation ("adjusted EBITDA"). Management believes that this non-GAAP financial measure provides useful supplemental information to management and investors regarding the performance of the company and facilitates a meaningful comparison of results for current periods with previous operating results. A reconciliation of GAAP net loss (the most directly comparable GAAP measure) to non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA is provided in the financial statement tables included in this press release, and investors are encouraged to review this reconciliation.
There are limitations in using this non-GAAP financial measure because it is not prepared in accordance with GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies and excludes expenses that may have a material impact on the company's reported financial results. This non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for GAAP financial measures. Investors and potential investors should consider non-GAAP financial measures only in conjunction with the company's consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP.
