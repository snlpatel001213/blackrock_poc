WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A meeting of foreign ministers in Canada next week to discuss diplomatic efforts on the Korean Peninsula aims to exert continued pressure on Pyongyang over its nuclear program, the U.S. State Department said on Thursday.
China and Russia will not be represented at the Vancouver meeting but will be given a readout of the discussions, Brian Hook, the departmentâ€™s director of policy planning, said at a news briefing.
