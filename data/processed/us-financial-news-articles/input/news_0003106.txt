The Pentagon says the U.S. has agreed to delay joint military exercises with South Korea until after the Winter Olympics.
Col. Rob Manning is a Pentagon spokesman. Manning says President Donald Trump agreed to the delay in consultation with South Korean President Moon Jae-in.
Manning says in a brief written statement: "The Department of Defence supports the president's decision and what is in the best interest of the ROK-U.S. alliance," referring to the U.S. defence treaty with the Republic of Korea.
The decision pushes back a set of annual military exercises known as Foal Eagle, which normally are held between February and April. Foal Eagle is a series of exercises designed to test the readiness of the two countries' militaries.
The Winter Olympics begin Feb. 9 in Pyeongchang, South Korea.
