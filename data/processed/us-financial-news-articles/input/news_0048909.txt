“I am very surprised at this kind of support. I must think hard how to be worthy of it,” 69-year-old Niinisto, who is known for cultivating good relations with Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin, told reporters. 
With about 86 percent of votes counted, centre-right Niinisto had won 62.1 percent, compared with 13.1 percent for closest rival Pekka Haavisto. Reporting by Jussi Rosendahl; Editing by David Goodman
