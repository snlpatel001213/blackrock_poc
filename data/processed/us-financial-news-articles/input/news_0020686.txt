Baylor senior point guard Manu Lecomte found his rhythm and the Bears picked up the beat as they defeated Oklahoma State, 76-60, on Monday night at the Ferrell Center in Waco, Texas.
Lecomte scored 30 points, including 25 in the second half, to help Baylor (12-6, 2-4 Big 12) race past the Cowboys after halftime. Forward Jo Lual-Acuil Jr. finished with 12 points to join Lecomte in double-digits scoring.
The Bears’ multiple zone defenses frustrated Oklahoma State (12-6, 2-4) into 40 percent shooting, which wasn’t efficient enough to keep up with Baylor when it heated up on the offensive end in the second half.
Forward Cameron McGriff scored 16 points to lead Oklahoma State and guard Tavarius Shine added 14.
Baylor opened up an eight-point lead with a barrage from beyond the arc midway through the second half. Lecomte hit a pair of 3-pointers, sandwiched around guard Jake Lindsey’s trey, providing all the offense during a 9-2 spurt.
Lecomte broke out of a recent slump from 3-point range by hitting 7 of 12 triples. His fourth 3-pointer of the game gave Baylor a 42-34 lead with 12:37 left.
