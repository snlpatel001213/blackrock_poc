LONDON (Reuters) - Everton manager Sam Allardyce took the blame for his side’s 4-0 thrashing at Tottenham Hotspur on Saturday, suggesting that he should have set up the team to be more “boring” rather than trying to outgun Mauricio Pochettino’s side.

Goals by midfielders Son Heung-min and Christian Eriksen on either side of a Harry Kane double handed ninth-placed Everton their third league defeat in a row. 
Allardyce suggested after the match that lessons had not been learnt from Everton’s 2-1 FA Cup defeat by Liverpool last week, a game that was settled by Virgil van Dijk’s late header. 
“Maybe I have to take the responsibility for playing too many attack-minded players... I should have gone back to being a bit more boring,” Allardyce said. 
”I reverted back to our Liverpool performance and thought if the team can play like that... surely you can come to Tottenham and deliver the same performance and maybe get a result. 
“It was a shock second-half performance. I saw some good signs of the players last week against Liverpool and I saw some of the worst signs in the second half today which is massively worrying... Obviously it’s something I have to address now.” 
Everton take on relegation-threatened West Bromwich Albion in the league next weekend. The Baggies secured their first top-flight win in 21 games with a 2-0 result against Brighton and Hove Albion on Saturday. 
“West Brom becomes a massive game next week so we don’t get dragged back into that relegation zone. After having a wonderful start we’re back in the danger zone. It’s our responsibility to get results and stay away from that,” Allardyce said. Editing by Christian Radnedge
