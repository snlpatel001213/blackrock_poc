 The White House said President Donald Trump believes in enforcing U.S. marijuana laws after the Department of Justice moved on Thursday to rescind the Obama-era policy that had eased enforcement of federal marijuana laws in states that have legalized pot.
“The president believes in enforcing federal law -- that’s his top priority -- regardless of what the topic is, whether it’s marijuana or immigration.” White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders told reporters.
