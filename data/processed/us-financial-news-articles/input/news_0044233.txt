AUSTIN, Texas, Jan. 24, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- SpareFoot, the world's largest marketplace for storage, moved its headquarters to University Park earlier this month. Founded in 2008, SpareFoot offers consumers the ability to compare self-storage, truck rental and moving services on SpareFoot.com and SelfStorage.com .
"The new headquarters building reflects the company culture of collaboration, creativity and collegiality as all 100 SpareFoot employees are now located on one floor," said co-founder and CEO Chuck Gordon. "We've come a long way from our first offices inside Capital Factory, to the Perry Brooks Tower across the street at 720 Brazos, and now to our current space."
Located just north of downtown, University Park has on-site gym and yoga room; free covered parking and indoor bike storage; and is dog-friendly -- an absolute must for SpareFoot employees' "SparePups."
The office features an open and bright layout with views of downtown and the University of Texas; a fully-outfitted on-site kitchen with in-house chef and culinary team; gaming area, and more. The layout includes multiple lounge areas for casual check-ins and co-working, as well as meeting rooms and a large event space.
SpareFoot was one of just three percent of Austin companies designated as a Silver-Level Mother-Friendly Worksite in 2017 and the new space features a fully outfitted Mother's Room with comfortable space to pump milk, in-room fridge, and sink.
In 2017, employees formed The Diversity and Inclusion Task Force and the Women of SpareFoot. The company sent a large employee delegation to The Texas Conference for Women in 2016 and 2017 and was a sponsor of the Austin Pride Parade in 2017.
The company has participated in the Austin Startup Games since its inception and won overall gold four times, more than any other competitor. SpareFoot won a silver medal in the 2018 games, raising $10,000 for Breakthrough Central Texas . To date, SpareFoot has raised over $100,000 for nonprofit organizations from Startup Games winnings.
Employees at SpareFoot also regularly participate in volunteer and fundraising activities. In 2017, SpareFoot employees ran a Street Store for the homeless, raised money for the Central Texas Food Bank and Austin Pets Alive!, worked to beautify local parks, and gave time to Dress for Success.
SpareFoot was named to the Top Company Cultures list in 2017 by Entrepreneur Magazine and has been named a Top Employer by the Austin American-Statesman since 2013.
