The rise in smartphone use is fuelling concern that digital dabbling will become as deadly as drunk-driving, especially if the punished only by fines.
President Emmanuel Macronâ€™s government is under pressure to combat resurgent road accident numbers. The number of road accident deaths has been on the rise since 2014, with most accidents still attributed to excess speed, use of alcohol and drug-consumption.
In Europe, bans on hand-held device usage are widespread but offences are generally limited to fines that vary from less than 50 euros in Ireland to several hundred in the Netherlands.
