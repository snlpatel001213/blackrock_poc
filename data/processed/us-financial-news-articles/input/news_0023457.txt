SEOUL, Jan 15 (Reuters) - North Korea has requested working talks on sending its athletes to the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics be held on Jan. 17 at the truce village of Panmunjom, the South’s unification ministry said in a mobile text message.
The message came after the two Koreas held a meeting earlier in the day to discuss other Olympics-related matters. The ministry did not say whether it accepted the North’s request. (Reporting by Christine Kim and Hyonhee Shin; Editing by Michael Perry)
