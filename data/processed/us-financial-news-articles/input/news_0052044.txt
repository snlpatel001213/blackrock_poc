Prudential : "It hit its high today and Metlife had some bad news after. PRU is not like Metlife , but the whole group trades down."
Extreme Networks : "I'm not really a fan of Extreme Networks and that's because I've got so many others in that area that I'd rather buy. Why do I have to go down that food chain? So I'm not going to."
AeroVironment : "We had [CEO Wahid Nawabi] on and you know what? I've got to tell you I like that story. They have a rival in North Carolina. It's very, very interesting because they do a lot of [agriculture]. These guys do ag, they do military. I think it's a win."
American Movil : "No, I'm going to take a pass. It's up too much."
Verizon Communications : "I like Verizon, particularly if it gets down to the $52 level."
