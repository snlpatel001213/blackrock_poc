SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea’s presidential office said it welcomed Kim Jong Un’s New Year speech where he raised the possibility of sending a delegation to the upcoming Winter Olympic Games to be held in Pyeongchang in the South, Yonhap news agency reported.
Kim on Monday warned the United States that he has a “nuclear button” on his desk ready for use if North Korea is threatened, but said he was “open to dialogue” with Seoul and may send a North Korean delegation to the Games as part of efforts to lower military tensions on the Korean peninsula.
