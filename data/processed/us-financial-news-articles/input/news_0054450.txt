Jan 31 (Reuters) - Futures for Canada’s main stock index edged higher on Wednesday, a day after the index hit an over seven-week low, and ahead of GDP data. 
The Canadian economy is forecast to have grown by 0.4 percent in November, regaining momentum after pausing in October. Analysts will look to see whether the details in the report, due at 8:30 a.m. ET, are strong enough to get fourth-quarter growth to the 2.5 percent pace the Bank of Canada anticipates. 
March futures on the S&P TSX index were up 0.05 percent at 7:15 a.m. ET. 
December producer prices data is also scheduled for release at 8:30 a.m. ET. 
Canada’s main stock index fell on Tuesday as the declining price of oil pulled shares of energy companies down for the second day in a row. 
Dow Jones Industrial Average e-mini futures were up 0.36 percent at 7:15 a.m. ET, while S&P 500 e-mini futures were up 0.34 percent and Nasdaq 100 e-mini futures were up 0.32 percent.
