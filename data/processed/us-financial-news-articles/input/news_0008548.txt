Half of British voters believe Prime Minister Theresa May is incapable of getting the right Brexit deal, according to an ORB poll published on Monday.
"There is still much work to be done to convince the British public that the prime minister is capable of getting the right deal for the UK," ORB said in a statement.
A year ago, just 35 percent of voters believed May was capable of getting the right Brexit deal.
The poll also showed voters were divided on whether Britain would be better off after Brexit: 43 percent said it would be while 42 percent said it would not be.
ORB asked 2,023 UK voters on Jan. 5-7. The margin of error at the 95 percent confidence level was 2.2. percent.
