Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny was released from police custody late on Sunday after a brief appearance at a rally in Moscow calling for the boycott of a March presidential election that he said would be a rigged.
Navalny's lawyer, Olga Mikhailova, told Reuters that her client had been released without charge but would have to face court at a later date.
If charged with violating laws on holding demonstrations, Navalny could face up to 30 days in jail.
