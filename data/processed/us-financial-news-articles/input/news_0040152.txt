Russell Westbrook scored 32 points and hit the go-ahead layup with 3.3 seconds remaining as the Oklahoma City Thunder rallied from a 15-point deficit to edge the Brooklyn Nets 109-108 Tuesday night at Chesapeake Energy Arena in Oklahoma City.
Westbrook capped his 14th game with at least 30 points by starting his drive from well behind the 3-point line after getting the inbounds from Paul George. He drove by Jarrett Allen and DeMarre Carroll and gave Oklahoma City the one-point lead.
The Thunder secured their fifth straight win when Spencer Dinwiddie missed a 3-pointer at the buzzer. Dinwiddie, who hit the game-winning shot Sunday in Detroit, took the inbounds from Carroll and attempted a step-back 3-pointer that hit the front of the net as time ran out.
Westbrook made 12 of 27 shots and scored eight of Oklahoma City’s last 12 points down the stretch. He gave the Thunder their first lead since the second quarter when his 15-foot pull up jumper over Dinwiddie made it 97-96 with 6:14 remaining.
Paul George added 28 points for the Thunder, who outscored the Nets 35-23 in the fourth quarter. Reserve Raymond Felton contributed 11 of his 14 in the fourth as the Thunder overcame quiet nights from Carmelo Anthony and Steven Adams, who combined for 16 points on 7 of 24 shooting.
Joe Harris tied a career high with five 3-pointers and led the Nets with 19 points. Dinwiddie and Carroll added 13 apiece for Brooklyn, which shot 46.8 percent and made 16 of 38 3-pointers. The Nets shot 52.9 percent in the fourth but allowed the Thunder to shoot 59.1 percent, including 5 of 8 in the fourth.
After losing the lead on Westbrook’s jumper, the Nets took a 104-101 lead on a 3-pointer by Carroll with 2:24 remaining. After Anthony made two free throws, Dinwiddie and rookie Jarrett Allen both missed on drives to the rim.
The Nets took a 106-105 lead on a dunk by Allen with 1:15 left but Westbrook hit two free throws on the next possession. Brooklyn took its final lead when Dinwiddie hit a layup with 7.8 seconds to go.
