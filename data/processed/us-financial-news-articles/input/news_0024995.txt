VANCOUVER, Jan. 16, 2018 /PRNewswire/ - Destiny Media Technologies (TSXV: DSY) (OTCQB: DSNY), the makers of Play MPE®, a cloud-based SaaS solution for digital asset management in the music industry, and Clipstream®, the world's first script powered video platform, today announced financial results for its fiscal 2018 first quarter ended November 30, 2017.
Highlights
Highlights for the quarter include:
Revenue growth of 9.1% (5.6% adjusted for foreign currency adjustments) Highest quarterly net income and EBITDA in over 5 years Strong balance sheet with increased cash position to $1.75M
First Quarter Fiscal 2018 Results
Revenue for the quarter ended November 30, 2017 grew by 9.1% (5.6% currency adjusted) to $973,798. This growth is primarily due to the growth in independent labels in the US. This, combined with a 7% decrease in overall operating expenditures to $738,831, resulted in the Company's highest reported net income in any single quarter since fiscal year 2012.
"These results reflect our first full quarter since our management transition," said Fred Vandenberg, Chief Executive Officer for Destiny Media Technologies, "As we expected, providing some care to our core Play MPE customers led to modest increases in usage, as shown by the growth in independent label revenue. Most importantly we are now one team focused on re-engaging with our Play MPE customers and getting version 8 released. This software update adds highly anticipated features, including Mac compatibility and easier to use release publishing tools. It will allow us to engage with existing, former and potential customers in a sales conversation with renewed enthusiasm that was not possible over the previous seven years."
