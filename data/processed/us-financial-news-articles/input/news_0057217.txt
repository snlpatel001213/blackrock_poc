CAPE TOWN (Reuters) - The former chairman of Steinhoff Christo Wiese told a parliamentary committee on Wednesday that it was difficult to detect fraud in a company especially when it involved a chief executive officer.
Wiese said he “understood people’s anger” after the firm admitted to accounting irregularities that triggered a slide in its shares that wiped more than $10 billion off its market capitalization.
