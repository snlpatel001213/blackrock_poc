Pflugerville, TX, Jan. 17, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- TrackingPoint, Inc. announced today that it has welcomed Tommy Millner, former CEO of retail giant Cabela’s, as a special advisor to TrackingPoint’s Board of Directors.
“TrackingPoint’s vision for the future is to bring our remarkable technology to the day-view optic market through traditional channels,” said Ken D’Arcy, TrackingPoint’s CEO, President, and Chairman of the Board. “Tommy’s veteran experience in the shooting sports and retail industries will play a key role as we advance our strategy in 2018 and beyond.”
Millner served as CEO of the Nebraska-based Cabela’s for almost 9 years. Prior to Cabela’s, he spent 14 years as president and CEO of North Carolina’s Remington Arms Company.
“TrackingPoint’s direction in combining precision technology in a day-view optic is a game-changer for shooting and hunting sports,” Millner said. “They have continuously improved the optics technology since 2011, and I believe that with the right strategy and partnerships, TrackingPoint will emerge as the leader in precision optics.”
D’Arcy said that TrackingPoint’s products and technology are much better positioned now for such a move than it was, even as recent as 2 years ago. “We’re in the right place today with our technology development, and Tommy’s reputation and expertise in the market are second to none. He’s the right person at the right time to assist in the evolution of TrackingPoint.”
