Standard Lithium Ltd. ﻿ (TSX.V:SLL) (FRA:S5L) (OTCQX:STLHF)﻿ launched in 2017 and is led by a management team harboring decades of experience in the lithium mining space. Standard Lithium stands out in this market because SLL is one of the few small cap investment options available in lithium mining that offers a pure play in the U.S. lithium market. This gives Standard Lithium a key strategic advantage when the U.S. market begins to seek domestic sources of metals like lithium, as per Trump’s executive order .
In the Bristol Dry Lake area, Standard Lithium is working quickly to capitalize on the growing demand for lithium, as it outlined in a mid-December update ( http://nnw.fm/1Cc5Z ). Standard Lithium installed a total of six new test evaporation ponds at the Bristol Dry Lake property in order to further assess the role that short-duration passive solar evaporation may play in pre-concentrating the near surface lithium brines encountered at the project. Standard Lithium also took samples of lithium brine from all surface pits in the Bristol Dry Lake property, with results expected in the coming weeks. The Cadiz Dry Lake property will be assessed in a similar manner.
The Smackover Project consists of up to 33,000 acres of brine leases located in a key brine production fairway in southern Arkansas, at the disposal of Standard Lithium for exploration, production, and extraction focus on lithium. Based on historical data, these areas have reported values of 370-424 mg/L of lithium in the brines. This elevates the Smackover Formation as a lower-risk exploration opportunity, which will aid in Standard Lithium’s endeavors to accelerate new production sources of lithium such as this one.
