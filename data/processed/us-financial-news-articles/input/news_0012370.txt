It looks like Oprah might not be considering a presidential bid after all. 
Oprah’s long-time best friend Gayle King says that the former talk show host has no plans to run for president right now, even if she might be “intrigued” by the idea, People reports . 
King made the comments on CBS This Morning Tuesday, a show she’s the co-anchor of. In October Oprah appeared on the program and repeatedly denied she might plan to run, going as far as to say, “There will be no running for office of any kind for me.” . @GayleKing on @Oprah considering running for president in 2020? "I absolutely don't think that her position has changed… I do think she's intrigued by the idea.
