NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- The Klein Law Firm announces that a class action complaint has been filed on behalf of shareholders of Capitala Finance Corp. (NASDAQ:CPTA) who purchased shares between January 4, 2016 and August 7, 2017. The action, which was filed in the United States District Court for the Central District of California, alleges that the Company violated federal securities laws.
In particular, the complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that (1) Capitala Investment Advisors had been losing professional talent in both underwriting and portfolio management due to the waiving of its incentive fee; (2) such loss of talent negatively impacted the quality of the Company’s investment portfolio; and (3) as a result, the Company’s public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times.
Shareholders have until February 26, 2018 to petition the court for lead plaintiff status. Your ability to share in any recovery does not require that you serve as lead plaintiff. You may choose to be an absent class member.
