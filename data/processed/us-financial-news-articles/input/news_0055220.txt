BURLINGTON, Wash., Jan. 30, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- SaviBank (OTC Pink:SVVB) , today reported for 2017 pre-tax income almost doubled to $2.28 million, compared to $1.18 million in 2016. Net income in 2017 was $27,000, or $0.002 per share, including the $1.49 million valuation charge for its deferred tax asset (DTA). In 2016, earnings totaled $5.73 million, or $0.49 per share, which included a DTA valuation addition of $5.0 million. Profitability was fueled by 21% loan growth, 30% deposit growth, excellent asset quality and strong net interest margin. All results are unaudited.
“In 2017, we accomplished several milestones that will support our growth for several years to come.” said Michal D. Cann, Chairman and CEO. “At the end of December, we formed Savi Financial Corporation, a small bank holding company, that will become the parent company of SaviBank. The holding company will facilitate the growth of our Northwest Washington franchise and provide additional avenues to fund growth. Earlier in the year, we completed a private placement of 5.4 million shares, raising net proceeds of $8.6 million. The offering was oversubscribed by $580,222 and brought 41 new shareholders into the ownership base. Finally, we opened a new branch on Whidbey Island expanding our footprint into this growing market.”
With the signing into law of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, generally accepted accounting principles required DTAs on corporate balance sheets be revalued to reflect the future tax benefits based on the new 21% top rate, which replaces the 35% top rate. “As a result of this accounting change, we made an adjustment to the value of our DTAs causing a tax expense of $1.49 million,” said Rob Woods, Chief Financial Officer. “In the fourth quarter of 2016, we recognized a tax benefit for the DTA valuation of $5.0 million.” The following table presents a year-to-year comparison of key financial results before these non-operating tax adjustments.

Change Net Income including DTA adjustments $ 27 $ 5,729 DTA valuation adjustment $ (1,490 ) $ 4,969 Income before DTA adjustment $ 1,517 $ 760 100 % Basic earnings per share before DTA $ 0.09 $ 0.06 36 % Return on average assets before DTA .75% .49% 55 % Return on average equity before DTA 5.59% 7.75% -28 % “When we recognized the value of the deferred tax assets in 2016, our marginal tax rate was 34%, which generated a significant tax benefit in the fourth quarter of that year. With the top marginal rate now at 21%, the value of that assets is lower than originally calculated,” said Woods. “We anticipate overall lower tax rates will contribute to higher profitability, going forward.”
Total revenue, consisting of net interest income and non-interest income, increased 17% to $2.78 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $2.37 million in the fourth quarter a year ago and declined 3% from $2.88 million in the third quarter of 2017, reflecting the timing and volume of government guaranteed loans. For 2017, revenues increased 29% to $11.06 million from $8.60 million in 2016.
Net interest margin, while still well above average, declined to 4.23% in the fourth quarter of 2017, from 4.46% in the third quarter and 4.36% in the fourth quarter a year ago. For the full year, net interest margin was 4.37% compared to 4.41% in 2016. The decline in NIM is due to an increase in our cost of funds as the market for deposits gets more competitive. The net interest margin is significantly better than the peer average of 3.71% posted by the 535 micro-cap banks in the SNL Financials Microcap Bank Index as of September 30, 2017.
“Non interest income benefited from the robust SBA and USDA loan production generated during the year. Non interest income increased 29% in 2017, to $1.71 million, of which $930, 000was from gains on the sale of loans compared to $1.32 million, of which $616,000 was from loans sales in 2016,” said Andrew Hunter, President. “The Western Washington economy continues to create strong demand for SBA and USDA loans and we continue to be highly competitive in our market for this funding source.”
Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2017 Highlights (at, or for the period December 31, 2017)
Earnings per share were a loss of $0.067 in the fourth quarter, reflecting the $0.087 charge from the DTA valuation and the capital raise in the first half of 2017 that added 5.4 million shares to the ownership base.

Allowance for loan losses, as a percentage of total loans was 1.06% at December 31, 2017, compared to 1.00%, at December 31, 2016.
With the new capital raised during the first half, SaviBank capital levels remain above the threshold for well-capitalized institutions. The total risk-based capital ratio was 15.15% and the tier-1 leverage ratio was 12.37%.
