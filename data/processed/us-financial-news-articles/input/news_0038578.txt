LONDON, Jan 23 (Reuters) - British budget airline easyJet said on Tuesday that recent reductions in capacity by competitors in the industry were contributing to a positive trading environment, as revenues improved in the first quarter.
easyJet, Europeâ€™s no.2 no-frills carrier behind Ryanair , said total revenue in the first quarter increased 14.4 percent to 1.14 billion pounds ($1.59 billion) helped by lower growth from rivals in its markets and positive foreign exchange effects.
