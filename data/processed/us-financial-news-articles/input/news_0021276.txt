"We are pleased to report strong financial and operating results for our first fiscal quarter as an NYSE-listed public company," said Mr. Peiqing Tian, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Four Seasons Education. "In particular, we are delighted to reverse the student enrollment trend from the first half of fiscal 2018 by achieving a 9.0% year-over-year growth in total student enrollment during the quarter. This growth was primarily driven by the expansion of our middle school program and non-math subjects recently launched to further diversify our program offerings. Thanks to our dedication to the after-school education market in Shanghai, we have built Four Seasons Education into a trusted brand for primary school math education and have expanded operations to five other cities in China.
"Along with our growth and development, we have remained steadfast in our commitment to providing the highest quality educational services to our students," continued Mr. Tian. "In essence, we believe that mathematics plays a critical role in shaping logic and reasoning and can profoundly benefit students' academic, career and life prospects. We are dedicated to cultivating our students' interest in math and enhancing their cognitive and logic abilities, therefore better prepare them for future development.
"Finally, to demonstrate our commitment to delivering value to our shareholders, we are pleased to declare an approximately US$20 million dividend payment," concluded Mr. Tian.

Driven by strong student enrollment growth, we also saw accelerated revenue growth on a year-over-year basis compared with the previous quarter, and we are confident to maintain the positive trend in the next quarter. In addition, our gross margin reached 65.4% in the third quarter, a 450 basis point expansion from the same period last year, as we continued to benefit from high learning center utilization. Looking forward, we will maintain our focus on program expansion in terms of grade levels and subjects to meet the significant and ever-growing demand for the after-school education. Coupled with our personalized proprietary curricula and experienced faculty team, we are committed to delivering high-quality educational services to our students with a superior learning experience and outstanding academic results."
