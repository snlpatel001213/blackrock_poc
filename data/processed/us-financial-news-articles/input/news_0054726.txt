Giannis Antetokounmpo scored 31 points in the game and Matthew Dellavedova added 10 in the fourth quarter as the Milwaukee Bucks extended their winning streak to four games with a 107-95 victory over the Philadelphia 76ers Monday night at the Bradley Center.
Milwaukee overcame a slow start to shoot 47.5 percent while hitting 11 of 28 3-pointers despite guard Eric Bledsoe playing just the first 2:32 of the game.
Daro Saric scored 19 points to lead Philadelphia, which shot 43.9 percent from the floor but missed 24 of 26 attempts from beyond the arc.
Philadelphia was playing shorthanded as well as center Joel Embiid was available to play in the second half of a back-to-back for the first time in his career but was scratched about 30 mintues before tipoff by head coach Brett Brown.
Even without Embiid, the Sixers were dominant inside, scoring 22 of their first 26 points at the rim -- with the other four coming from the free-throw line. But Philadelphia went 0-for-15 from deep in the opening half while Antetokounmpo and Khris Middleton combined for 26 to send Milwaukee into the break with a 55-53 lead.
Back-to-back 3-pointers from Tony Snell and Middleton put the Bucks ahead by eight with 3:54 left in the third. Antetokounmpo had a chance to make it a 10-point lead but lost the ball and James Young knocked down Philadelphia’s first 3-pointer with 3:15 left, bringing the Sixers within five.
The Bucks hit 4 of 7 3-point attempts in the quarter and went into the fourth with an 83-75 lead.
A Middleton jumper early in the final quarter gave Milwaukee a 10-point cushion and after Robert Covington came up empty on the other end, Sterling Brown connected on a 27-footer from the right wing to put the Bucks up 88-75 with 10:25 to play.
They wouldn’t score again, though, until a Dellavedova 3 with 6:50 to go. He followed that with a steal, went the length of the court, drew contact from Covington then hit both free throws to put the Bucks back up 12.
