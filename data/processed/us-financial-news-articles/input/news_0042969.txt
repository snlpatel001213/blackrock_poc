NEW YORK, Jan 23 (Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court on Tuesday overturned a lower courtâ€™s decision to grant class certfication to car owners who settled with Hyundai Motors and its Kia affiliate over the fuel efficiency of its vehicles.
In their 2-1 order, the judges of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit said the lower judge had erred in concluding that common questions existed to justify a class action status.
