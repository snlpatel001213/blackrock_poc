WASHINGTONâ€”The Supreme Court on Monday ordered lower courts to consider claims by a black convict from Georgia who alleges his death sentence was tainted with racial bias.
Keith Tharpe was convicted of the 1990 murder of his sister-in-law, Jacquelyn Freeman, who had been accompanying his estranged wife. After shooting Ms. Freeman with a shotgun, Mr. Tharpe kidnapped his wife and allegedly sexually assaulted her.
