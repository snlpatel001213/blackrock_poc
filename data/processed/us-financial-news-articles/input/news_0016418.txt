LOS ANGELES — Federal immigration authorities swarmed nearly 100 convenience stores in 18 states and the District of Columbia on Wednesday morning and warned businesses that the Trump administration’s hard-line stance on immigration applies to them too. 
“Today’s actions send a strong message to U.S. businesses that hire and employ an illegal workforce: ICE will enforce the law, and if you are found to be breaking the law, you will be held accountable,” said Tom Homan, deputy director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. 
Agents from ICE’s Homeland Security Investigators showed up unannounced at 98 7-Eleven convenience stores before dawn Wednesday to interview store employees and managers, and serve notice that employment records were being audited. Agents arrested 21 employees suspected of being in the country illegally. They now face deportation proceedings in federal immigration court. 
Dallas-based 7-Eleven Inc. said in a statement that the company was aware of ICE’s visits to various stores Wednesday morning. The company said franchises of the convenience store chain are independently owned and operated, but franchisees are required to adhere to all federal and local laws. 7-Eleven Inc. is owned by Tokyo-based Seven & i Holdings Co. 3382, -0.08%
