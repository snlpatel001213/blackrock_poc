MILAN, Jan 10 (Reuters) - Shares in Monte dei Paschi di Siena rose more than 6 percent on Wednesday, leading gains in Italian banks fuelled by an improving economy and the ongoing decrease in the stock of bad bank loans, traders said. 
Italyâ€™s banking index rose more than 2 percent by 1151 GMT. Shares in Intesa Sanpaolo and Banco BPM rose 3 percent. 
The Bank of Italy on Wednesday said gross bad debts at Italian banks fell 6.4 percent from a year earlier in November compared with an year-on-year drop of 5.5 percent in October. Reporting by Valentina Za, editing by Giulia Segreti
