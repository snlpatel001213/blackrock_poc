VIENNA (Reuters) - The Syrian opposition will not attend a peace conference that Russia is hosting in Sochi next week, a spokesman for the opposition delegation to U.N.-brokered peace talks in Vienna said on Saturday. 
The Syrian government and its ally Russia had not provided the necessary commitments and the Sochi conference was an attempt to undermine the United Nationsâ€™ efforts to broker a peace deal, the spokesman, Yahya al-Aridi, said. Related Coverage
