STUTTGART (Reuters) - Overnight wage talks for industrial workers in the southwestern German state of Baden-Wuerttemberg ended with no agreement on Saturday, the regional employersâ€™ association said, raising the prospect of nationwide walkouts. 
Powerful German union IG Metall had said on Friday it would hold off on its threat to call all-out strikes to hold last-ditch talks with employers over higher wages and the right to shorter working hours for industrial workers. 
Any deal in Baden-Wuerttemberg would typically be applied in other states as well. Reporting by Ilona Wissenbach; Writing by Maria Sheahan;
