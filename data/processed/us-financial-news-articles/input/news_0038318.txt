(Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration has cleared Boeing Co’s ( BA.N ) 787-10 Dreamliner for commercial use, the planemaker said on Monday.
The Boeing 787-10, which competes with Airbus SE’s ( AIR.PA ) A350, is a stretched version of the earlier 787-9 Dreamliner and can carry 330 people, seven more than originally designed for.
Boeing said it has more than 170 orders for the fuel-efficient jetliner so far, from nine customers worldwide, and deliveries will start in first half of 2018.
