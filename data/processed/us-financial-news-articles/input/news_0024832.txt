The debt-laden airline would be divided into core airline business, regional arm, ground handling and engineering operations, the report added. 
The core airline business comprising Air India and Air India Express, the low-cost overseas arm, will be offered as one company, and the process will be completed by the end of 2018, Bloomberg reported, quoting Junior Aviation Minister Jayant Sinha. bloom.bg/2DxrCWF
