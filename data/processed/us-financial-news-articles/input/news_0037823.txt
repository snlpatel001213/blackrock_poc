Jan 22 (Reuters) - Bacardi Ltd will buy premium tequila maker Patron Spirits International AG in a $5.1 billion deal, the family-owned liquor company said on Monday, as it seeks to expand in the United States.
Bacardi, known for Grey Goose vodka and its namesake rum, has held a minority stake in Patron since 2008.
The deal will make Bacardi the No.2 spirits company by market share in the United States, Bacardi said. (Reporting by Uday Sampath in Bengaluru; editing by Sai Sachin Ravikumar)
