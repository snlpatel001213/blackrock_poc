FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Germany’s Volkswagen ( VOWG_p.DE ), vying for the top spot among the world’s largest carmakers, reported a gain in 2017 sales of 4.3 percent to 10.7 million vehicles.
Rivals Toyota ( 7203.T ) and Renault-Nissan ( RENA.PA ) are expected to announce full-year unit sales at the end of January and February, respectively.
VW group’s gains in December, up 8.5 percent from a year earlier to 1.0 million vehicles, were driven by growth in China and Germany.
