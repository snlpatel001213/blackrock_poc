Record Average Client Trades per Day of 726,000
Record Net New Client Assets of $26.5B
GAAP Diluted EPS $0.52; Non-GAAP Diluted EPS $0.80 (1)
OMAHA, Neb.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- TD Ameritrade Holding Corporation (Nasdaq: AMTD) has released results for the first quarter of fiscal 2018. The Company reported record client trading activity of approximately 726,000 client trades per day, on average, and gathered a record $26.5 billion in net new client assets for the quarter. These results further benefited from continued strong investor engagement and the Company’s acquisition of Scottrade. Clearing conversion is expected to be completed in the March quarter.
Financial results for the quarter ended Dec. 31, 2017 include the following: (2)
Record net new client assets of approximately $26.5 billion, a growth rate of 9 percent Record average client trades per day of approximately 726,000, up 49 percent year over year Net revenues of $1.3 billion, 63 percent of which were asset-based Client assets of approximately $1.2 trillion, up 48 percent year over year $0.52 in GAAP earnings per diluted share, up 27 percent year over year, on net income of $297 million $0.80 in Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share (1) , up 86 percent year over year Pre-tax income of $303 million, or 24 percent of net revenues Interest rate-sensitive assets (3) of $156 billion, up 25 percent year over year
“We’re off to an outstanding start in 2018, with powerful momentum and financial strength continuing across all core metrics. Our enhanced competitive position and increased scale, thanks to our recent acquisition of Scottrade, is further accelerating our earnings power, which we expect to continue following the final clearing conversion,” said Tim Hockey, TD Ameritrade president and chief executive officer. “Trading was at record levels, and investor engagement has continued across all client segments as the market reached new highs. Enhanced consumer interest in blockchain and cannabis-related securities drove a further surge in engagement in the final weeks of the quarter, particularly among first-time investors. New account growth is at record levels, interest in our digital guidance solutions remains high, and use of our multiple mobile offerings continues to rise. Our fully-staffed service centers are busy, providing education to clients and arming them with the information they need to make informed investment decisions.”
“While we remain focused on the experience we deliver to these clients, much more work lies ahead, starting with delivering a successful Scottrade integration – not just operationally, but culturally as well,” Hockey continued. "We are a company that wants to transform lives and investing for the better, and that purpose will shape our growth strategy for years to come, inspiring the actions we take to deliver long-term value for our clients, employees and shareholders. How we earn revenue, how we grow more agile and efficient, how we invest in employee development and innovation – it all ladders back to our shared commitment to drive transformational change, and we are motivated by the opportunities and potential that lies ahead.”
“It was an eventful quarter as major indices hit all-time highs, the Fed raised interest rates, and a sweeping tax overhaul was approved,” said Steve Boyle, executive vice president and chief financial officer. “These factors – paired with our first full quarter of Scottrade earnings – further boosted our growth, driving strong GAAP and Non-GAAP results for the quarter. Furthermore, with the new tax bill being signed into law before the end of the calendar year, we were able to realize additional significant benefits in the quarter, primarily due to a re-measurement of our deferred tax liability. There are a number of options before us in putting this incremental revenue to good use, and we plan to look at each of them, as well as our capital deployment plans, in greater detail once we’ve successfully completed the Scottrade clearing conversion.”

(1) Non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share (EPS) are non-GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC Regulation G. We define non-GAAP net income as net income adjusted to remove the after-tax effect of amortization of acquired intangible assets and acquisition-related expenses. We consider non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted EPS as important measures of our financial performance because they exclude certain items that may not be indicative of our core operating results and business outlook and will allow for a better evaluation of the operating performance of the business and facilitate a meaningful comparison of our results in the current period to those in prior and future periods. Amortization of acquired intangible assets is excluded because management does not believe it is indicative of our underlying business performance. Acquisition-related expenses are excluded as these costs are directly related to our acquisition of Scottrade Financial Services, Inc. and are not representative of the costs of running the Company’s on-going business. Non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted EPS should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, GAAP net income and diluted EPS. (2) EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) is considered a non-GAAP financial measure as defined by SEC Regulation G. We consider EBITDA an important measure of our financial performance and of our ability to generate cash flows to service debt, fund capital expenditures and fund other corporate investing and financing activities. EBITDA is used as the denominator in the consolidated leverage ratio calculation for covenant purposes under our senior revolving credit facility. EBITDA eliminates the non-cash effect of tangible asset depreciation and amortization and intangible asset amortization. EBITDA should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, GAAP pre-tax income, net income and cash flows from operating activities. (3) Liquid assets available for corporate investing and financing activities is considered a non-GAAP financial measure as defined by SEC Regulation G. We consider "liquid assets available for corporate investing and financing activities" to be an important measure of our liquidity. We include the excess capital of our regulated subsidiaries in the calculation of liquid assets available for corporate investing and financing activities, rather than simply including the regulated subsidiaries' cash and cash equivalents, because capital requirements may limit the amount of cash available for dividend from the regulated subsidiaries to the parent company. Excess capital, as defined below, is generally available for dividend from the regulated subsidiaries to the parent company. Liquid assets available for corporate investing and financing activities should be considered as a supplemental measure of liquidity, rather than as a substitute for GAAP cash and cash equivalents. We define liquid assets available for corporate investing and financing activities as the sum of (a) excess corporate cash and cash equivalents and investments, less securities sold under agreements to repurchase and (b) our regulated subsidiaries' net capital in excess of minimum operational targets established by management. Excess corporate cash and cash equivalents and investments includes cash and cash equivalents from our investment advisory subsidiaries and excludes (i) amounts being maintained to provide liquidity for operational contingencies, including lending to our broker-dealer and FCM/FDM subsidiaries under intercompany credit agreements, (ii) amounts maintained for corporate working capital and (iii) the net amounts held as collateral for derivative contracts. Liquid assets available for corporate investing and financing activities is based on more conservative measures of net capital than regulatory requirements because we generally manage to higher levels of net capital at our regulated subsidiaries than the regulatory thresholds require.
