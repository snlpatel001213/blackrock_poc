(1) Reinvested dividends and capital gains of $5.9 billion and $1.1 billion for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and
September 30, 2017 respectively, are included in long-term inflows. For previous periods, reinvested dividends and capital gains are
included in market gains and losses.
(2) As of December 31, 2017, the company changed the presentation of long-term inflows, outflows and AUM to exclude Unit Investment
Trusts (UITs) and product leverage. All periods have been reclassified to conform to the new presentation. Non-management fee
earning AUM includes Invesco PowerShares QQQ, UITs and product leverage.
(3) Annualized long-term organic growth rate is calculated using long-term net flows (annualized) divided by opening long-term AUM for
the period. Long-term AUM excludes institutional money market and non-management fee earning AUM.
Net market gains led to a $66.0 billion increase in AUM during 2017, compared to a $37.7 billion increase in 2016. Foreign exchange rate movements led to a $21.4 billion increase in AUM during 2017, compared to a $22.1 billion decrease in 2016. Average AUM during 2017 were $875.0 billion, compared to $788.8 billion for 2016, an increase of 10.9%.
Net market gains led to a $14.9 billion increase in AUM during the fourth quarter, compared to a $15.0 billion increase in the third quarter 2017. Foreign exchange rate movements led to a $2.5 billion increase in AUM during the fourth quarter, compared to a $6.7 billion increase in the third quarter 2017. Average AUM during the fourth quarter were $930.3 billion, compared to $890.8 billion for the third quarter 2017, an increase of 4.4%. Further analysis is included in the supplementary schedules to this release.
Operating Results - year ended December 31, 2017
This section discusses the company's full year 2017 results, as compared to 2016, and comments on significant items that have impacted the company's results as presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The results of the acquired European ETF business are included from the acquisition date of August 18, 2017.
Operating revenues increased $425.9 million (9.0%) to $5,160.3 million in 2017, from $4,734.4 million in 2016, primarily due to increased investment management fees. Investment management fees increased by $353.5 million (9.4%) to $4,126.6 million in 2017, from $3,773.1 million in 2016 due to 10.9% higher average AUM. Foreign exchange rate changes decreased operating revenues by $35.3 million compared to 2016. Performance fees increased $69.0 million (155.8%) to $113.3 million in 2017 from $44.3 million in 2016, primarily related to the performance fee generated in the third quarter by Invesco's Mortgage Recovery Fund.
Operating expenses increased $325.2 million (9.1%) to $3,883.2 million in 2017, from $3,558.0 million in 2016, primarily due to increased employee compensation and third-party distribution, service and advisory costs. Foreign exchange rate changes decreased 2017 operating expenses by $21.2 million when compared to 2016. Business optimization charges increased to $58.0 million in 2017, compared to $49.9 million in 2016. As of the end of 2017, this initiative has produced annualized run-rate expense savings of $43.8 million. These savings have helped offset acquisition and regulatory-related increases in operating expenses.
Non-operating income and expense includes equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates of $44.7 million in 2017 primarily from our private equity and real estate investments as well as our Chinese joint ventures. Also included in non-operating income is other income of consolidated investment products (CIP), net of $137.3 million in 2017 as compared to $79.2 million in 2016.
Other gains and losses, net was a gain of $51.5 million in 2017 compared to $22.9 million in 2016. The components and variances are included in the table below:

Operating revenues increased 2.8% to $1,375.6 million in the fourth quarter, from $1,337.7 million in the third quarter 2017. The change was primarily due to increased investment management fees. Foreign exchange rate changes increased operating revenues by $2.7 million compared to the third quarter 2017.
Investment management fees increased by $36.4 million (3.4%) to $1,098.7 million in the fourth quarter, from $1,062.3 million in the third quarter 2017, due to an increase of 4.4% in average AUM between the periods.

Performance fees were $43.0 million in the fourth quarter, compared to $42.3 million in the third quarter 2017. Performance fees recorded in the fourth quarter arose primarily from real estate and bank loan products.
Other revenues increased by $0.9 million (5.8%) to $16.4 million in the fourth quarter, compared to $15.5 million in the third quarter 2017, primarily resulting from increased real estate transaction fees.
Operating expenses increased $48.9 million (5.0%) to $1,031.3 million in the fourth quarter, from $982.4 million in the third quarter 2017. Business optimization charges were $9.0 million in the fourth quarter, compared to $12.3 million in the third quarter.

Third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses increased by $10.5 million (2.8%) to $390.9 million in the fourth quarter, from $380.4 million in the third quarter 2017, consistent with the increase in revenues resulting from the increase in retail AUM.
Employee compensation expenses decreased by $11.2 million (2.8%) to $381.9 million in the fourth quarter, from $393.1 million in the third quarter 2017. Staff severance costs related to business optimization were $2.8 million in the fourth quarter compared to $7.6 million in the third quarter. Third quarter compensation costs also included a $5.5 million non-cash charge related to the company's U.K. defined benefit plan. The fourth quarter also includes a decrease in variable compensation costs.
Marketing expenses increased by $11.2 million (38.0%) to $40.7 million in the fourth quarter from $29.5 million in the third quarter 2017 reflecting marketing campaigns related to the acquired European ETF business, cross-border funds and normal seasonal increases in advertising, client events and other marketing costs.
Property, office and technology expenses increased $10.0 million (10.8%) to $102.8 million in the fourth quarter, from $92.8 million in the third quarter 2017 primarily related to increased outsourced administration and software costs.

General and administrative expenses for the fourth quarter included $15.6 million of legal, other professional services fees and amortization related to acquisitions compared to $6.9 million in the third quarter 2017. The fourth quarter also includes increases of $9.3 million primarily related to regulatory changes and business growth initiatives, including product costs and other legal and consulting costs. Increased costs in the fourth quarter also led to an increase of $1.7 million in irrecoverable taxes as compared to the third quarter.
Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates decreased $9.3 million (72.1%) to $3.6 million in the fourth quarter from $12.9 million in the third quarter 2017 primarily due to a decrease in earnings from partnership investments. Non-operating other income and expenses in the fourth quarter also included a $44.8 million consolidated investment product (CIP) net gain comprised of market-driven gains and losses on investments held by the consolidated funds and net interest income of CIP (third quarter 2017: $31.7 million gain).

Taxation
Our effective tax rate decreased to 18.8% for the year ended December 31, 2017 and to (5.8%) for the fourth quarter (year ended December 31, 2016: 28.0%; third quarter 2017: 31.0%). The decreases reflect a 9.3% rate decrease for the year and a 33.9% rate decrease for the fourth quarter as a result of a $130.7 million tax benefit related to the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities following the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the "2017 Tax Act") enacted in the United States.
The inclusion of income from non-controlling interests decreased our effective tax rate 0.5% in 2017 and increased our effective tax rate by 0.2% in the fourth quarter (year ended December 31, 2016: decrease of 0.3%; third quarter 2017: decrease of 0.5%). Third quarter 2017 included a 3.5% rate increase as a result of Illinois tax regulation changes adopted in the quarter.
The impact of the 2017 Tax Act may differ from the estimate recorded this quarter due to, among other things, changes in interpretations and assumptions that company has made as well as additional regulatory guidance that may be issued.
Capital Management

The credit facility balance was zero at December 31, 2017 (zero at September 30, 2017; $28.7 million at December 31, 2016).

Non-GAAP Information and Reconciliations
We utilize the following non-GAAP performance measures: net revenues (and by calculation, net revenue yield on AUM), adjusted operating income, adjusted operating margin, adjusted net income attributable to Invesco Ltd., and adjusted diluted EPS. We believe the adjusted measures provide valuable insight into our ongoing operational performance and assist in comparisons to our competitors. These measures also assist management with the establishment of operational budgets and forecasts and assist the Board of Directors and management in determining incentive compensation decisions. The most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures are operating revenues (and by calculation, gross revenue yield on AUM), operating income, operating margin, net income attributable to Invesco Ltd., and diluted EPS.
The following are reconciliations of operating revenues, operating income (and by calculation, operating margin), and net income attributable to Invesco Ltd. (and by calculation, diluted EPS) on a U.S. GAAP basis to a non-GAAP basis of net revenues, adjusted operating income (and by calculation, adjusted operating margin), and adjusted net income attributable to Invesco Ltd. (and by calculation, adjusted diluted EPS). In addition, a reconciliation of adjusted operating expenses is provided below, together with reconciliations of the U.S. GAAP operating expense lines to provide further analysis of the non-GAAP adjustments. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered as substitutes for any U.S. GAAP measures and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. The tax effect of the reconciling items is based on the tax jurisdiction attributable to the transactions. These measures are described more fully in the company's Forms 10-K and 10-Q. Refer to these public filings for additional information about the company's non-GAAP performance measures.
