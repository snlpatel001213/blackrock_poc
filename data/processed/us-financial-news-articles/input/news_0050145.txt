Gold fell on Monday as a revival in the dollar and a rise in bond yields to multi-year peaks prompted some buyers to cash in gains in the metal after its sixth weekly price increase in seven weeks.
Gold has risen more than 3 percent so far this month, and after a strong end to December touched its highest since August 2016 last week at $1,366.07 an ounce.
Its strength has been driven largely by a slide in the dollar index to three-year lows. An uptick in the currency on Monday after six straight weeks of losses has prompted a pullback.
Spot gold was down 0.7 percent at $1,340.07 an ounce at 12:19 p.m. EST, while U.S. gold futures for February delivery were down 1.01 percent an ounce at $1,338.50.

The dollar edged up against a currency basket on Monday as rising bond yields helped underpin the greenback ahead of a week packed with U.S. data.
It remains on track for its biggest monthly decline since March 2016, however. The currency came under pressure last week after Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin indicated he was broadly supportive of a weak dollar, though U.S. President Donald Trump later said he wanted to see strength in the currency.

Gold traders are now awaiting the outcome of a Federal Reserve policy meeting this week, as well as key U.S. jobs data, an important indicator of the strength of the broader economy. Both will be watched for their implications for U.S. interest rates.
Gold is highly sensitive to rising U.S. rates, which increase the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding bullion while boosting the dollar, in which it is priced.
