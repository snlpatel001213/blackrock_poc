STEVENSON, Md.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- The securities litigation law firm of Brower Piven, A Professional Corporation, announces that a has been commenced in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California on behalf of purchasers of Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (Nasdaq: AMD) (“AMD” or the “Company”) securities during the period between February 21, 2017 and January 11, 2018, inclusive (the “Class Period”). Investors who wish to become proactively involved in the litigation have until March 19, 2018 to seek appointment as lead plaintiff.
If you wish to choose counsel to represent you and the class, you must apply to be appointed lead plaintiff and be selected by the Court. The lead plaintiff will direct the litigation and participate in important decisions including whether to accept a settlement for the class in the action. The lead plaintiff will be selected from among applicants claiming the largest loss from investment in AMD securities during the Class Period. Members of the class will be represented by the lead plaintiff and counsel chosen by the lead plaintiff. No class has yet been certified in the above action.
The complaint accuses the defendants of violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 by virtue of the defendants’ failure to disclose during the Class Period that the Company had a fundamental security flaw in its processor chips that rendered them susceptible to hacking.
According to the complaint, following a January 3, 2018 report that Google’s Project Zero security team had discovered serious security flaws affecting computer processors built by Intel Corporation, AMD and other chipmakers, and a January 11, 2018 press release announcing that its chips were, in fact, susceptible to the security flaws, the value of AMD shares declined significantly.
If you have suffered a loss in excess of $100,000 from investment in AMD securities purchased on or after February 21, 2017 and held through the revelation of negative information during and/or at the end of the Class Period and would like to learn more about this lawsuit and your ability to participate as a lead plaintiff, without cost or obligation to you, please contact Brower Piven either by email at hoffman@browerpiven.com or by telephone at (410) 415-6616.
