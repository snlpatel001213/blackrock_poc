Trump called on the U.S. Congress to pass legislation to ensure at least $1.5 trillion in new infrastructure spending, and urged lawmakers to put aside partisan interests but pushed a hard line on immigration. "The lack of specifics (and a more combative tone) has allowed US equity markets and U.S. Treasury bonds to steady and improve after slipping since the start of the week but the U.S. dollar remains on the defensive overall," Scotiabank analysts wrote in a client note. The new round of weakness came after a period of consolidation earlier this week as markets expected the U.S. Federal Reserve to take a more confident stance about the outlook of the economy but keep policy unchanged. The Fed will publish a policy statement later Wednesday following a two-day meeting. Currencies from Brazil, Colombia, Mexico and Chile firmed between 0.2 percent and 1 percent as the U.S. dollar headed for its biggest monthly drop in nearly two years against a basket of developed market currencies. Stock markets were mixed with Brazil's benchmark Bovespa index the biggest gainer in the region due to a rally in bank shares. Banco Santander Brasil SA rose sharply after it beat fourth-quarter earnings estimates and quickly expanded its loan book into higher-margin segments. Shares in other lenders, such as Banco Bradesco SA and Ita√∫ Unibanco Holding SA, followed along.
