(Reuters) - Nine men were charged on Tuesday over the hazing death of a 20-year-old fraternity pledge, who died of alcohol poisoning at Florida State University late last year, police said. 
The nine men, who are between the ages of 20 and 22, were charged with college hazing causing injury or death in Leon County after a two-month investigation into the death of Andrew Coffey, the Tallahassee Police Department said in a statement. 
“This collaborative investigation was critical to finding answers for Andrew Coffey’s family and our community. Hopefully, this investigation and its outcome will prevent another tragedy from occurring,” said Police Chief Michael DeLeo in the statement. 
Coffey died Nov. 3 after attending “Big Brother Night” at the Pi Kappa Phi fraternity, where he was a pledge. An autopsy found his blood alcohol level was .447, more than five times the legal limit to drive, the Tallahassee Democrat reported. 
Florida State University, a school of more than 41,000 students, suspended all fraternities and sororities after the incident. Reporting by Brendan O'Brien in Milwaukee; Editing by Toby Chopra
