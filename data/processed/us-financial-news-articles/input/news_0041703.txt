(Reuters) - Celgene Corp’s ( CELG.O ) quarterly profit and sales topped analysts’ estimates on strong demand for its flagship multiple myeloma drug Revlimid, sending its shares up more than 2 percent in premarket trading on Thursday. 
Celgene gets more than 60 percent of its revenue from its blockbuster drug Revlimid. Sales of which grew 21 percent to $2.19 billion, slightly ahead of the consensus estimate of $2.18 billion, according to Cowen & Co. 
The beat comes at a time when Celgene announced deals to buy Juno Therapeutics Inc ( JUNO.O ) and privately held Impact Biomedicines in efforts to reduce reliance on Revlimid by bulking up its cancer pipeline. 
Celgene, which had cash and cash equivalents of $12.04 billion as of Dec. 31, said it would buy Juno for $9 billion in cash and Impact for as much as $7 billion, contingent on milestones. 
Sales of Celgene’s psoriasis drug Otezla came in at $371 million, well above the consensus estimate of $337 million. 
“Otezla U.S. strength suggests plenty of room for global growth,” Brian Abrahams from RBC Capital Markets wrote in a client note. 
Celgene posted a net loss of $81 million, or 10 cents per share, in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, from a profit of $429 million, or 53 cents per share, a year earlier. 
The U.S. biotechnology company took a $1.21 billion income tax charge in the quarter due to the U.S. tax code overhaul. 
Excluding items, the company earned $2 per share, beating the average analyst estimate of $1.97, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. 
Revenue rose 16.9 percent to $3.48 billion, ahead of analysts’ estimate of $3.46 billion. 
Celgene, which preannounced its 2017 and 2018 unaudited results earlier this month, reiterated its 2018 forecast. Reporting by Akankshita Mukhopadhyay in Bengaluru; Editing by Martina D'Couto
