SUFFOLK, Va., Jan. 29, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Hampton Roads based TowneBank (NASDAQ:TOWN) announced that, at the close of business on January 26, 2018, it completed the previously announced merger with Paragon Commercial Corporation (“Paragon”) and its wholly-owned bank subsidiary. Pursuant to the previously announced terms of the merger, stockholders of Paragon are entitled to receive 1.7250 shares of TowneBank common stock for each share of Paragon common stock.
“We are pleased to welcome our friends at Paragon to the TowneBank family as we take this exciting step forward together,” said G. Robert Aston, Jr., Chairman and CEO of TowneBank. “This combination of two great community banks will allow us to better serve the financial needs of our customers, while also providing the opportunity to enhance profitability and increase shareholder value.”
On a pro forma combined basis giving effect to the merger as if the transaction had occurred on September 30, 2017, TowneBank would have approximately $10.5 billion in total assets.
Following the merger, TowneBank will operate in the Raleigh, Charlotte, and Cary markets as Paragon Bank, a division of TowneBank. Robert C. Hatley, former President and CEO of Paragon, will continue in his role as the President and CEO of the Paragon Division.
“Our staff, our clients, our Board of Directors and our shareholders are extremely excited this day has come. The combination of two outstanding banks, which are mirror images of each other in their business models, the attention to detail, their commitment to their staffs, their clients and their communities, will create the best banking franchise in North Carolina and Virginia,” said Hatley.
In connection with the completion of the merger, two Paragon directors, Robert C. Hatley and Howard Jung, will join the Board of Directors of TowneBank.
