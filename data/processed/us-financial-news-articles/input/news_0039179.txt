David Pastrnak scored twice in a three-point game and the Boston Bruins continued their incredible roll with a 4-1 victory over the Montreal Canadiens Saturday night in Montreal.
Torey Krug also collected three points in a one-goal, two-assist performance and goalie Tuukka Rask made 20 saves for the Bruins, who have put together a 12-0-4 since their last loss in regulation time on Dec. 14.
The Bruins took control of the game with a pair of goals less than two minutes apart late in the second period to erase a 1-0 deficit.
Pastrnak put the visitors on the board with a horrid goal for Montreal netminder Carey Price to surrender while his teamâ€™s playoff hopes are fading fast. Pastrnak sent the puck to the front of the net from the corner of the rink and it somehow slipped past Price, who appeared to have left his position early in anticipation of it being a pass to the slot.
Krug scored the eventual game-winner with a beautiful tally. While the Bruins were creating all kinds of chaos in the Montreal zone, Krug jumped down from his point position to take a feed from Pastrnak, after which he ripped a high shot home.
After Pastrnak notched his 20th goal of the season, Riley Nash rounded out the scoring with an empty-net goal. Brad Marchand had two assists and Patrice Bergeron added a helper to remain red hot, having collected nine goals and six assists in the last nine games.
After a scoreless first period, Max Pacioretty opened the scoring for the Canadiens, potting his seventh goal in as many games to the delight of the Bell Centre crowd. Paul Byron stripped Bruins defenseman Charlie McAvoy of the puck in the neutral zone to create an odd-man rush, then fed the Montreal captain with a perfect pass, and Pacioretty promptly rifled the puck past Rask. With his assist, Byron has now collected five points in four games.
Price stopped 23 shots for the Canadiens, who have just three wins in their last 12 games (3-7-2).
