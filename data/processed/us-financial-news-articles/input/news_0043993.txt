Product and Financial Highlights – December Quarter
The Advanced Products category continues to deliver strong revenue growth, posting an increase of 30% from the year ago quarter and constituting 56% of total sales. Broad-based growth was driven by the industry–leading 20nm and 16nm technology nodes. Revenues from the 20nm node grew significantly to a new record, increasing more than 70% from the same quarter year ago and the 16nm node continued its accelerated ramp with sales more than quadrupling during the same period, reflecting very broad-based customer adoption. The Industrial, Aerospace & Defense end market set another quarterly record with revenues of $297 million, an increase of 23% from the same quarter a year ago, driven by significant strength in Semiconductor Test and Emulation Applications. Xilinx's unrivaled technology leadership has been a significant driver for the record-setting revenue performance. Xilinx achieved its operating margin target of 30%, one quarter ahead of schedule, while continuing investments in its technology leadership, share gains, and market expansion efforts for sustained revenue growth. Xilinx remains committed to returning cash to shareholders and during the first nine months of the fiscal year we have returned approximately 100% of our operating cash flow back to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases. Xilinx continued to demonstrate strong customer momentum in its Cloud Computing market expansion opportunity. Market leader Alibaba recently announced plans for two generations of FPGA as a Service (FaaS) F2 and F3 using Virtex® Ultrascale +™ FPGAs. Additionally, Amazon Web Services expanded their FaaS F1 deployment to multiple regions, including availability in its secured government cloud.
Business Outlook – March Quarter Fiscal Year 2018
Sales are expected to be approximately $635 - $665 million. Gross margin is expected to be 69% to 71%. Operating expenses are expected to increase to approximately $285 million, including a one-time charge of approximately $30 million primarily related to the CEO transition. Other income is expected to be approximately $3 million. March quarter tax rate is expected to be approximately 0 – 5%.
