PARIS (Reuters) - French police were searching several sites belonging to dairy producer Lactalis on Wednesday following a salmonella contamination scare that prompted a global recall of several baby food products, a source at the Paris prosecutorâ€™s office said. 
The scandal deepened this month when it emerged some of the recalled baby foods had still made their way onto shop shelves in a number of supermarket chains. 
The Paris prosecutor opened a preliminary probe into the salmonella contamination scare in late December. Reporting by Emmanuel Jarry, Writing by Sarah White, Editing by Richard Lough
