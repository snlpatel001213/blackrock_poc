In addition to headphones, Beats had developed a music-streaming service that caught the eye of Apple. In 2014, Beats agreed to be acquired by Apple for $3 billion. As part of the deal, Iovine stayed on with Apple and helped the company launch its streaming-music service Apple Music based on the technology Beats had already developed.
