COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Danish police said on Monday they have charged 1,004 children and young people for sharing video clips of two 15-year-olds having sex, following a tip-off from Facebook.
They said it could constitute distribution of child pornography even though the age of consent in Denmark is 15.
The two video clips were shared through Facebookâ€™s Messenger chat-platform in the autumn and the company advised the U.S. authorities about it, as it is obliged to.
The tip-off was then passed on to Denmark via Interpol.
Most of the young people charged have only shared the videos a few times whereas as some have shared them several hundred times, police said.
