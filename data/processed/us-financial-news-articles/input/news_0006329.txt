President Donald Trump’s growing feud with Steve Bannon is threatening the former White House strategist’s leadership of the conservative Breitbart News website and upending Bannon’s plans to wage “war” on party incumbents he deemed insufficiently loyal to the White House agenda. 
Trump said Bannon has “lost his mind” and that he has “nothing to do with me or my presidency,” a response to Bannon’s numerous incendiary comments—including insults about the president’s family—in a new book about the first year of the Trump administration.

Bannon’s longtime benefactors, billionaires Robert Mercer and his daughter Rebekah Mercer, are actively distancing from him even before the expected release of Michael Wolff’s book “Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House,” according to two people close to the Mercers.

They and other Breitbart News Network LLC board members on Thursday were debating whether to oust Bannon as chairman, with many supportive of the move, according to a person familiar with the exchanges. Among the considerations are Breitbart’s contractual relationships with other entities, including Sirius XM radio SIRI, +1.92% , that involve Bannon. 
Staffers at Breitbart, which Bannon has described as his “killing machine,” described a “chaotic” day at the company, with writers—many personally recruited by Bannon—wondering whether he would last the day.
