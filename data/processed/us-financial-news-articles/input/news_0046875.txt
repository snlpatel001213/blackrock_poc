“Today I accepted Steve Wynn’s resignation as Republican National Committee finance chair,” said RNC Chairwoman Ronna Romney McDaniel. 
The Wall Street Journal on Friday reported that shortly after Wynn opened his flagship Wynn Las Vegas in 2005, a manicurist who worked there told a colleague Mr. Wynn forced her to have sex. The casino billionaire later paid the manicurist a $7.5 million settlement, the Journal reported. 
Beyond that incident, dozens of people the Journal interviewed who have worked at Wynn’s casinos described a pattern of sexual misconduct. 
Wynn denied the accusations, saying, “The idea that I ever assaulted any woman is preposterous.” A spokesman for Wynn didn’t immediately return a request for comment on his resignation from the RNC.
