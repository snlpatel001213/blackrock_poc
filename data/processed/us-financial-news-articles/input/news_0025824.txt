ATHENS (Reuters) - Greece’s parliament approved a bill for fiscal, energy and labor reforms prescribed by the country’s international lenders in exchange for fresh bailout funds.
The draft legislation was approved by a majority of lawmakers in the 300-seat parliament. Thousands of people had rallied outside the building to protest against the measures.
