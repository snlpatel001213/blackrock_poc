When Johnny Depp has a good year, he makes a fortune — in 2016, he raked in $48 million . 
But an on-going legal battle between Depp and his management company , The Management Group (TMG), reveals the star also spends a bundle on an extravagant lifestyle — as much as $2 million a month, according to a previous episode of CNBC's " The Filthy Rich Guide ," which explores the issue. 
In a January 2017 filing, Depp alleged TMG mismanaged his finances, costing him millions. TMG counterclaimed that Depp dug himself into a financial hole, despite warnings from advisors . Harry Durrant | Getty Images 
Here are a few things that constitute Depp's monthly bills, according to the lawsuit: $30,000 on wine $300,000 on staff, including 40 full-time employees $150,000 on security for himself and his family $200,000 for a private jet 
But the actor has also been know to splurge big. 
According to TMG, Depp spent more than $75 million to buy and furnish 14 residences, including an entire village in France. Depp is now trying to unload the town , which features a church, a restaurant and several houses, for $63 million . Splash News Johnny Depp bought an entire chain of islands in the Bahamas for $3.6 million in 2004. 
Depp also purchased an entire chain of islands in the Bahamas for $3.6 million in 2004. Three years later, he closed on five separate penthouses in the same Los Angeles building for a collective $7.2 million. He put those properties back on the market in 2016 for $12.78 million. 
However, one of Depp's craziest purchases proves even more impractical than a French village. To fulfill a final wish of his late friend, writer and journalist Hunter S. Thompson, who died in 2005, Depp spent $3 million to blast Thompson's ashes from a custom-built canon. The affair also included fireworks, live music and a host of celebrity guests.
