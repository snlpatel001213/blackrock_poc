PENSACOLA, Fla., Jan. 09, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Hom/Ade Foods, Inc is voluntarily recalling Mary B’s® brand biscuits due to potential contamination with Listeria monocytogenes . The problem was discovered in a product sampling conducted by an outside co-packer, who manufactured the product.
Listeria monocytogenes is an organism which can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems. Although healthy individuals may suffer only short-term symptoms such as high fever, severe headache, stiffness, nausea, abdominal pain and diarrhea, Listeria infection can cause miscarriages and stillbirths among pregnant women.
The Mary B’s products affected are frozen bagged biscuits with the UPC codes listed below. All “Best If Used By” dates BEFORE September 23, 2018 and with the letter “M” immediately after the date are included in the recall. The code may be found on the back of the bag, lower right corner. No other code dates are affected.
