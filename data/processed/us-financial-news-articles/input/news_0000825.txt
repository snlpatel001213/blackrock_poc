Jan 3 (Reuters) - Insurance Australia Group Ltd said on Wednesday it has finalised its catastrophe reinsurance program for the 2018 calendar year, cutting its catastrophe coverage on a net of quota share basis. 
The company said in a statement it is reducing its catastrophe main coverage to A$5.23 billion ($4.09 billion) representing a 16 percent reduction from the prior year, consequently increasing the firm’s exposure to catastrophes. 
IAG added it experienced “modest upwards pressure” on reinsurance rates during the renewal process. ($1 = 1.2773 Australian dollars) (Reporting by Aaron Saldanha   Cynthia Osterman)
