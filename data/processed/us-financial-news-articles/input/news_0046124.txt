AMMAN (Reuters) - The Syrian opposition delegation at peace talks in Vienna received a pledge on Friday from Russia that it will push the Syrian army to enforce a ceasefire in the besieged eastern Ghouta, an opposition spokesman said on Friday
“There was a Russian pledge to the negotiating team ... It will begin at 12, after midnight today,” Ayman al Asemi, a member of the Free Syrian Army’s military council told Reuters
Syrian army and Russian jets have for the last two months been escalating their bombardment of the besieged rebel enclave near Damascus, killing dozens of civilians and injuring hundreds, rebels and aid workers say.
