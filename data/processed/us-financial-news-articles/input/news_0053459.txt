Comments of Management
"The fourth quarter was an exceptionally strong end to our best year yet," commented Mr. Shaike Orbach, Silicom's President & CEO. "Our business is being driven by today's massive infrastructure transition. Cloud & Web 2.0 companies, telcos, service providers and end-users are all scrambling to keep up with the data-avalanche, and recognize that our products can give them a significant performance and functionality edge.
"For example, we are proud to have been chosen by one of the Cloud industry's leading innovators to design and supply its next-generation Switch-Fabric-on-a-NIC product, a revolutionary concept that could, once it reaches a steady state, give us revenues of up to $75 million per year. In parallel, we continue to secure important new design wins for our cyber security, SD-WAN, NFV, fintech and other Cloud solutions, from both new and existing customers."
Mr. Orbach concluded, "With so many of these trends at an early stage, we feel exceptionally well positioned and are very excited about our growth prospects. Our strategy is straightforward: we will continue expanding our penetration into the Cloud, move deeper into SD-WAN and NFV markets, grow our business with existing customers and sell to a widening circle of new customers. Building up from the best year in our history, and with market trends in our favor, the future has never been brighter for Silicom."
