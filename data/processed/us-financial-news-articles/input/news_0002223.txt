WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump said in a tweet on Tuesday the United States may withhold payments to Palestinians because they are “no longer willing to talk peace.”
He said Washington gives Palestinians “HUNDRED OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS a year and get no appreciation or respect. They don’t even want to negotiate a long overdue peace treaty with Israel.”
