"The Caldwell Partners team delivered a strong performance in the first quarter," said John Wallace, chief executive officer. "The overall economic outlook remains healthy, as we continue to experience solid search demand, notwithstanding our unbalanced performance from geography to geography. We saw robust revenue growth in the US this quarter, which augmented our somewhat muted results in Canada and continued financial investments in the establishment and growth of the UK. While we do anticipate unevenness from quarter to quarter and from our geographic regions, our partners are collectively performing strongly, with search volumes and pricing holding steady."
Wallace continued: "As we continue to grow our presence, and to further respond to our client's needs and requirements, it has become imperative to address the need to add supplemental breadth and depth to our existing teams, in order to continue to enhance our overall capabilities. As such, we will be placing incremental attention in the coming months and quarters on the recruitment of Partners and teams, with a particular emphasis in the United States."
The Board of Directors today also declared the payment of a quarterly dividend of 2.0 cents per Common Share payable to holders of Common Shares of record on January 23, 2018 and to be paid on March 19, 2018.
Financial Highlights (all numbers expressed in $000s)
Operating revenue: Professional fees for the first quarter of 2018 increased 9.9% (an increase of 14.4% excluding an unfavourable 4.5% variance from exchange rate fluctuations) over the comparable period last year to $14,973 (2017: $13,629). The increase in professional fees is attributable to a slightly higher Average Number of Partners at 38.0 compared to 37.8 in the prior year period and an increase in Average Fee per Assignment to $131 (2017: $117) partially offset by a lower Number of Assignments per Partner from 3.1 to 3.0 resulting in a decrease in number of assignments to 114 (2017: 116). First quarter professional fees in the US were up 20.8% (up 27.3% excluding an unfavourable 6.5% variance from exchange rate fluctuations) to $11,545 (2017: $9,557). The gain was the result of increases in the Number of Assignments per Partner, the Average Number of Partners and the Average Fee per Assignment. First quarter professional fees in Canada were down 5.7% to $3,384 (2017: $3,589). A higher Average Fee per Assignment was more than offset by a lower Number of Partners and a lower Number of Assignments per Partner. First quarter professional fees in Europe were down 90.9% (down 91.0% excluding a 0.1% favourable variance from exchange rate fluctuations) to $44 (2017: $483). The addition of one new partner in the second half of 2017 and another late in the current period resulted in a higher Number of Partners, offset by a significantly lower Number of Assignments per Partner and Average Fee per Assignment. License fees from our licensees in Latin America and New Zealand for the use of the Caldwell Partners brand and intellectual property for the 2017 first quarter were $76 (2017: $75).
Operating profit: For the first quarter of 2018, higher revenue ($1,345) more than offset by the combination of higher cost of sales ($852) and higher expenses ($688) resulted in a decrease in operating profit of $195 to $904 (2017: $1,099) over the comparable period in the prior year. Excluding exchange rate variances, operating profit decreased $124 to $975. First quarter cost of sales increased 8.3% (12.9% excluding a favourable 4.6% variance from exchange rate fluctuations), or $852 to $11,073 (2017: $10,221). Expenses in the first quarter increased 28.9% or $688 over the same period in the prior year to $3,072 (2017: $2,384). Excluding exchange rate variances, expenses increased $787 or 33.0% over the same period last year. This constant currency increase was the result of increases in share-based compensation expense caused from an increase in the share price in the current year versus a decline in the share price in the same period last year ($328), firm-wide search team practice meetings for business development and training being held during the period in the current period but not in the prior year ($165), a reduction in the final Hawksmoor acquisition (UK – 2014) earn-out amount payable recognized in the prior year with no such reduction in the current year as the amount was fully settled ($115), increased marketing expenses related to our brand update initiative ($100), increased partner recruitment expenses ($68), increased business development costs ($65) and general increases across other categories ($38). These unfavourable variances were partially offset by decreases in legal fees ($70) and increases in foreign exchange gains on intercompany loans and US dollar bank account balances ($22). On a segment basis, $1,101 of profit was from the US ($1,366 net of intercompany license fees), $299 of profit was from Canada ($34 net of intercompany license fee revenue) and Europe's operating loss was $496. The year over year decrease in operating profit of $195 came from decreases in Canada of $139 and Europe of $430, partially offset by an increase in the US of $374.
Net earnings after tax: First quarter net income was $410 ($0.020 per share), as compared to $762 ($0.038 per share) in the comparable period a year earlier.
