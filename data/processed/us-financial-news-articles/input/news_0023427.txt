MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Highlights of Monday’s opening day of the Australian Open, the first grand slam tournament of the year:
0635 COCO GOES BANANAS CoCo Vandeweghe received a code violation for time wasting because there were no bananas available at Hisense Arena.
After losing the first set in a tiebreak to Hungarian Timea Babos, the American number 10 seed remained in her seat and argued with chair umpire Fergus Murphy that she should be allowed more time during the break because bananas had not been provided in time.
“I‘m waiting for the bananas,” Vandeweghe, who lost the match 7-6(4) 6-2, told the umpire.
