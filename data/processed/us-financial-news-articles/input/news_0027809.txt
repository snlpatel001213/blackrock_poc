(Reuters) - Burnley have agreed a deal to sign winger Aaron Lennon from Premier League rivals Everton, British media reported on Friday. 
Lennon, 30, has not scored a goal in 15 league appearances for the Merseyside club this season and his imminent departure follows the arrival of forward Theo Walcott from Arsenal this week.
