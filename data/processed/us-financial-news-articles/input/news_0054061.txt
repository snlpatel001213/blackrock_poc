Development Activity
During the quarter, the Company announced plans to create the Southeast's premier mixed-use development at Atlanta's Phipps Plaza, headlined by the arrival of a new Nobu Hotel and Nobu Atlanta Restaurant. Additional elements of this exciting new development call for a unique, curated dining experience, a 90,000 square-foot Life Time® Athletic healthy living and entertainment destination, and a 12-story Class A office building, complete with a three-story lower level parking garage. Construction is slated to commence in 2018 with a phased opening beginning in spring 2020.
During the quarter, we started construction on two new development projects scheduled to open in 2018, including:
Malaga Designer Outlet (Malaga, Spain); scheduled to open in November. Simon owns a 46% interest in this project. Queretaro Premium Outlets (Queretaro, Mexico); scheduled to open in December. Simon owns a 50% interest in this project.
Construction continues on two new development projects scheduled to open in 2018, including:
Premium Outlet Collection Edmonton IA (Edmonton, Alberta, Canada); scheduled to open in May. Simon owns a 50% interest in this project. Denver Premium Outlets (Thornton, Colorado); scheduled to open in September. Simon owns 100% of this project.
Construction also continues on significant redevelopment and expansion projects at properties including Aventura Mall, Town Center at Boca Raton and Toronto Premium Outlets.
At quarter-end, redevelopment and expansion projects, including the addition of new anchors, were underway at 25 properties in the U.S., Canada and Asia.
Financing Activity
The Company was active in both the unsecured and secured credit markets in 2017, continuing to lower our effective borrowing costs.
The Company completed two senior notes offerings totaling $2.7 billion, with a weighted average coupon rate of 3.07% and a weighted average term of 7.9 years.
During 2017, and subsequent to year-end, we retired three series of senior notes comprising approximately $2.6 billion at a weighted average coupon rate of 3.65%. The two new notes offerings had a weighted average coupon rate approximately 60 basis points lower than the notes that were retired.
The Company also amended and extended its $4.0 billion multi-currency revolving credit facility, which reduced pricing to LIBOR plus 77.5 basis points and extended the term to June 30, 2022.
With regard to secured debt activity, we closed or committed on 20 mortgage loans totaling approximately $2.9 billion, (U.S. dollar equivalent), of which Simon's share is $1.8 billion. The weighted average interest rate and weighted average term on these loans is 3.37% and 6.7 years, respectively.
As of December 31, 2017, Simon had approximately $8.0 billion of liquidity consisting of cash on hand, including its share of joint venture cash, and available capacity under its revolving credit facilities.
2018 Guidance
The Company currently estimates net income to be within a range of $6.90 to $7.02 per diluted share for the year ending December 31, 2018 and that FFO will be within a range of $11.90 to $12.02 per diluted share.

Footnotes to Unaudited Financial Information
Notes:
(A)
Excess investment represents the unamortized difference of our investment over equity in the underlying net assets of the related partnerships and joint ventures shown therein. The Company generally amortizes excess investment over the life of the related properties.
(B)
The Unaudited Joint Venture Combined Statements of Operations do not include any operations or our share of net income or excess investment amortization related to our investments in Klépierre and HBS Global Properties. Amounts included in Footnotes D below exclude our share of related activity for our investments in Klépierre and HBS Global Properties. For further information on Klépierre, reference should be made to financial information in Klépierre's public filings and additional discussion and analysis in our Form 10-K.
(C)
This report contains measures of financial or operating performance that are not specifically defined by GAAP, including FFO, FFO per share, comparable FFO per share and comparable EPS. FFO is a performance measure that is standard in the REIT business. We believe FFO provides investors with additional information concerning our operating performance and a basis to compare our performance with those of other REITs. We also use these measures internally to monitor the operating performance of our portfolio. Our computation of these non-GAAP measures may not be the same as similar measures reported by other REITs.
We determine FFO based upon the definition set forth by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT"). We determine FFO to be our share of consolidated net income computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding real estate related depreciation and amortization, excluding gains and losses from extraordinary items, excluding gains and losses from the sales or disposals of, or any impairment charges related to, previously depreciated retail operating properties, plus the allocable portion of FFO of unconsolidated joint ventures based upon economic ownership interest, and all determined on a consistent basis in accordance with GAAP.
We have adopted NAREIT's clarification of the definition of FFO that requires it to include the effects of nonrecurring items not classified as extraordinary, cumulative effect of accounting changes, or a gain or loss resulting from the sale or disposal of, or any impairment charges relating to, previously depreciated retail operating properties. We include in FFO gains and losses realized from the sale of land, outlot buildings, marketable and non-marketable securities, and investment holdings of non-retail real estate. However, you should understand that FFO does not represent cash flow from operations as defined by GAAP, should not be considered as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with GAAP as a measure of operating performance, and is not an alternative to cash flows as a measure of liquidity.
