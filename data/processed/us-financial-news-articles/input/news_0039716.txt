WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican U.S. Senator Susan Collins said on Sunday that a group of more than 20 moderates will present ideas for resolving the shutdown of the federal government to the Senate’s leadership.
“We are just going to discuss with the leaders the results of the conversations we had,” said Collins, who represents Maine in the Senate.
