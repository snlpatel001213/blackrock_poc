ANKARA (Reuters) - President Tayyip Erdogan said on Monday that Turkey had an agreement with Russia regarding its military operation against a U.S.-backed Kurdish militia in Syriaâ€™s Afrin region and that Ankara would not take a step back from the operation.
In a speech in the capital Ankara, Erdogan said Turkey would take control of Afrin, as it had done in the Syrian towns of Jarablus, al-Rai and al-Bab, and that Syrians would be able to return home.
