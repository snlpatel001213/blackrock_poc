Footage of a Tesla Model X pulling a semi truck through the snowy streets of Raleigh, N.C. is circulating online—and was even retweeted by CEO Elon Musk . 
The video was posted to Facebook by someone identified as Kyle Connor with Ben Spreen (who according to comments was the driver ). It shows the electric SUV pulling a semi truck on a snow-dusted street with the caption “5,000 lb towing limit, lol. Ben #ModelX #Tesla #TeslaSemi #Snow #DualMotor.” According to comments the driver was using Slip Start mode, which can help Model X drivers navigate certain difficult road conditions such as snow, gravel, or a deep rut.
