0 COMMENTS Copper prices fell to their lowest level in over a month Tuesday, as data showing a surge in Chinese production prompted some investors to take profits on gains in the metal.
Copper for March delivery was recently down 2.1% at $3.1330 a pound on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, the lowest price since mid-December.
China produced 865,000 tons of copper in December, churning out a record 8.89 million tons for the whole of 2017, according to the country’s National Bureau of Statistics.
The increased production undercut the case for tightening global supplies of the metal, prompting some investors to lock in recent gains, said Bart Melek, head of global commodities strategy at TD Securities.
Copper has risen around 14% in the last year on Comex, helped by a weakening U.S. dollar. A weaker dollar makes dollar-denominated commodities less expensive for holders of other currencies.

In precious metals, gold for February delivery was up 0.4% at $1,336.80 a troy ounce. Analysts said the safe-haven metal was benefiting from continued uncertainty over the U.S.’s long-term budget.
Among base metals, zinc was down 0.29% at $3,406.50 a metric ton, aluminum was down 0.51% at $2,237.75 a metric ton, tin was down 0.22% at $20,700 a metric ton, nickel was down 0.08% at $12,735 a metric ton, and lead fell 0.10% to $2,608 a metric ton.
