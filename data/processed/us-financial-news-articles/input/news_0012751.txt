SEOUL, Jan 9 (Reuters) - Tech giant Samsung Electronics Co Ltd said on Tuesday its fourth-quarter operating profit likely rose 64 percent from a year earlier, falling short of market expectations.
Samsung said its October-December profit was likely 15.1 trillion won ($14.14 billion), compared with an average forecast of 15.9 trillion won from a Thomson Reuters survey of 17 analysts.
Revenue was estimated to have increased 24 percent to 66 trillion won, Samsung said in a regulatory filing.
The South Korean company did not elaborate on its performance and will disclose detailed earnings in late January. ($1 = 1,067.7700 won) (Reporting by Joyce Lee; Editing by Stephen Coates)
