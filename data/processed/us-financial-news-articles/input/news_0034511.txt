(Reuters) - Three USA Gymnastics board members resigned on Monday in the wake of a sex abuse scandal involving its former team physician, the organisation said in a statement. 
The resignations include the board’s chairman, vice chairman and treasurer who comprise the organisation’s executive leadership team, the statement said. 
The organisation has been criticized by several of the sport’s top gymnasts during the sentencing of former team doctor Larry Nassar who has pleaded guilty to molesting female gymnasts. 
Prosecutors have asked for a sentence of 40 to 125 years for Nassar, 54, who was also a prominent physician at a Michigan State University sports clinic. That would add to a 60-year sentence he is serving in federal prison on child pornography convictions. 
About 120 victims were expected to make statements at the sentencing hearing. Reporting by Keith Coffman; Editing by Richard Chang and Grant McCool
