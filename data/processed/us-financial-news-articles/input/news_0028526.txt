PRAGUE, Jan 16 (Reuters) - Czech carmaker Skoda Auto, a Volkswagen unit, boosted its global sales by 6.6 percent to a record 1.2 million vehicles in 2017 after the launch of new SUV models and growth in Europe, it said on Tuesday.
Skoda delivered over 1 million cars for the fourth year in a row as its sales continue to grow, helped last year by starting sales of its full-sized SUV Kodiaq and mid-sized SUV Karoq.
China remained Skodaâ€™s biggest market and grew 2.5 percent, followed by Germany and the home Czech market, where a fast-growing economy has boosted sales. (Reporting by Jason Hovet)
