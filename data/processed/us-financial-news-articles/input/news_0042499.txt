BALTIMORE, Md., Jan. 25, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ArmadaCare, a supplemental insurance company, recently appointed Matthew Mattice to its newly created position, Vice President of National Accounts, to help address the growing demand for supplemental medical benefits.
“ArmadaCare is experiencing unprecedented momentum in the group health benefits market, especially with our new suite of supplemental insurance products,” says Ed Walker, CEO of ArmadaCare. “While companies of all sizes can leverage these products in some way, large companies have a strong demand for such strategic, targeted solutions that will help them avoid employee turnover when making cost-cutting changes to benefits.”
With his extensive experience in corporate executive benefits, consulting and insurance, Mattice is well suited to work with the benefit leaders of large national companies in collaboration with their benefit consultants. These consultants play a valuable role in helping companies find the right balance between controlling benefit costs and recruiting/retaining talent, the latter of which is a top concern with the U.S. unemployment rate at a 17-year low.
“I’m looking forward to fostering existing relationships as well as creating more connections for ArmadaCare,” adds Mattice. “It’s exciting to bring such unique solutions to the table that help with both healthcare coverage as well as retention and recruitment issues. A lot of national companies are facing significant challenges in these areas, and they need solutions like what ArmadaCare has designed.”
