You should replace your iPhone 6 battery if you've owned the phone for a couple years and if it feels slower than normal. Since Apple throttles performance as the battery starts to lose its charging power, this is a good way to make sure your phone is still running in top shape.
Owners of the iPhone 6 or later can begin the battery replacement online through Apple's website or by visiting an Apple Store.
