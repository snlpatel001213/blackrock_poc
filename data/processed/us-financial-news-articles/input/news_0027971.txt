NEW YORK (Reuters) - World equity markets climbed to a record on Friday as the U.S. dollar languished near three-year lows and a U.S. government shutdown loomed, while U.S. Treasury yields continued their steady rise to hit their highest levels since September 2014. 
President Donald Trump postponed plans to leave Washington while the U.S. Congress faced a midnight deadline to come up with funding legislation to avoid the shutdown. 
Legislation to stave off an imminent federal government shutdown encountered obstacles in the Senate on Thursday night, despite the passage of a month-long funding bill by the House of Representatives hours earlier. [nL1N1PE0H4]

The benchmark 10-year yield US10YT=RR hit its highest level since September 2014 at 2.646 percent, breaking the 2017 high of 2.64 percent which the market had been flirting with all week. 
“That is still a manageable level for equities, so this move doesn’t necessarily surprise us. Markets will begin to take increasing notice the higher it gets, if it continues to inch higher,” said Joy. 
Benchmark 10-year notes US10YT=RR last fell 9/32 in price to yield 2.6444 percent, from 2.611 percent late on Thursday. 
Oil prices retreated and were on course to snap a four-week winning streak, as a bounce-back in U.S. production outweighed ongoing declines in crude inventories. [nL3N1PE1K7]
