KRONPLATZ, Italy (Reuters) - Runaway World Cup leader Mikaela Shiffrin made a rare slip on Tuesday when she skidded off the course and failed to complete the first leg of the giant slalom at Kronplatz in Italy.
Shiffrin, who has won 10 World Cup races this season, had nearly finished her run when she made her error. The U.S. skier was back up quickly and appeared annoyed with herself rather than hurt physically.

German Viktoria Rebensburg won the race in a combined time of 2 minutes 6.19 seconds. Shiffrin leads the overall World Cup standings on 1,477 points, with Rebensburg second on 634.
