The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped past 25000 for the first time Thursday, on pace to notch the fastest run to a fresh 1,000-point milestone in history.
The blue-chip index, which heavily weights industrial giants such as Boeing Co. and Caterpillar Inc., was recently up 138 points, or 0.6%, at 25061. If the Dow industrials close above 25000, the jump from 24000 would have taken 23 trading days, ahead of the 24-day spans that took the index to 11000 in 1999 and 21000 in March.
