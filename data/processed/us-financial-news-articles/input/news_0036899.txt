29 COMMENTS Why do many college students want to see limits placed on campus free speech?
In this episode of Moving Upstream , we explore three factors that are influencing the national debate: polarization, postmodernism and provocation.
We spoke with dozens of students and teachers from around the country; among them, New York University professor and administrator Urlich Baer, who defends the students who are blocking controversial, conservative speakers from speaking on their campuses. He says these students do so out of a “fundamental commitment to racial equality.”
Then there’s Bret Weinstein, who resigned from Evergreen State College in June, and identifies himself as a progressive. He thinks social justice activists, who are blocking conservative speakers, are influenced by the postmodernist world view.
We also visit with University of California at Berkeley student organizer Gaelan Ash, who explains why he thinks people like Steve Bannon should be banned from speaking on college campuses.
