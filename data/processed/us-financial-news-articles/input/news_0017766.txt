LAFOX, Ill., Jan. 10, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Richardson Electronics, Ltd. (NASDAQ:RELL) today reported financial results for its second quarter ended December 2, 2017. The Company also announced that its Board of Directors declared a $0.06 per share quarterly cash dividend.
Second Quarter Results
Net sales for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 increased 15.5% to $39.1 million compared to net sales of $33.8 million in the prior year’s second quarter. Sales increased $4.8 million for PMT and $1.3 million for Canvys. PMT sales were higher in power grid tubes, power conversion and RF and microwave components as well as specialty products sold into the semiconductor wafer fabrication capital equipment market. Sales increased for Canvys due to higher overall demand in Europe. Sales decreased for Richardson Healthcare by $0.8 million due to the sale of the PACS Display business at the end of fiscal 2017, partially offset by higher certified pre-owned CT Tube sales.
Gross margin increased to $13.4 million, or 34.2% of net sales during the second quarter of fiscal 2018, compared to $11.0 million, or 32.4% of net sales during the second quarter of fiscal 2017. Margin increased as a percent of net sales primarily due to a favorable product mix. Richardson Healthcare margin as a percent of net sales also increased due to the sale of its lower margin PACS Display business.
Operating expenses were $12.6 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 compared to $13.4 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2017. The second quarter of fiscal 2017 included $1.3 million in severance expense from a reduction in force. After excluding the severance expense from the second quarter of fiscal 2017, operating expenses increased due to higher research and development expenses for Richardson Healthcare and additional expenses relating to the increase in net sales. Operating expenses as a percent of sales decreased to 32.2% in the current quarter from 35.7% last year when excluding the severance expense from the second quarter of fiscal 2017.
As a result, the company reported $0.8 million of operating income for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 compared to an operating loss of $2.4 million in the prior year’s second quarter. Other expense for the second quarter of fiscal 2018, primarily a foreign exchange loss, was $0.1 million, compared to other income of $0.2 million, primarily a foreign exchange gain, for the second quarter of fiscal 2017.
The income tax provision of $0.5 million during the second quarter of fiscal 2018 reflected a provision for foreign income taxes based on the current quarter’s geographical distribution of income, additional tax due from an audit in Germany and no U.S. tax benefit due to the valuation allowance recorded against the net operating loss. The tax provision of $0.3 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2017 included a provision for foreign income taxes and no U.S. tax benefit due to the valuation allowance recorded against the net operating loss.
Income from continuing operations for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 was $0.2 million, compared to a loss from continuing operations of $2.5 million in the second quarter of 2017. In addition, during the second quarter of fiscal 2018, the Company received an income tax refund from the State of Illinois, inclusive of interest and net of professional fees, of $1.5 million. This refund was a result of the conclusion of the Illinois amended return related to the sale of the RF, Wireless and Power Division (“RFPD”) in 2011 and was therefore, classified as income from discontinued operations.
As a result, net income for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 was $1.7 million compared to a net loss of $2.5 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2017.
