(Reuters) - UDG Healthcare ( UDG.L ) said it expects adjusted earnings per share to increase by 18-21 percent in 2018, driven by a strong first-quarter and benefits from the U.S tax reform. 
The company, which provides outsourced sales and marketing, drug distribution and packaging services to healthcare companies, said pre-tax profit in the first quarter of the year was well ahead of last year, helped by recent acquisitions. 
UDG said it would gain from a reduction in the headline US federal corporate tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent. Reporting By Justin George Varghese in Bengaluru; Editing by Saumyadeb Chakrabarty
