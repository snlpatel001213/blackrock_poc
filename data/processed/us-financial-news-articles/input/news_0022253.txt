JAKARTA, Jan 15 (Reuters) - A mezzanine floor that collapsed and injured at least a dozen people in the Indonesia Stock Exchange building on Monday was not caused by a bomb, a police official said. 
“We can confirm that this was not because of a bomb,” national police spokesman Setyo Wasisto told reporters. 
The building is one of a two-tower complex which was targeted in a car bombing by Islamist militants in September 2000. (Reporting by Agustinus Beo Da Costa; Writing by Kanupriya Kapoor; editing by Nick Macfie)
