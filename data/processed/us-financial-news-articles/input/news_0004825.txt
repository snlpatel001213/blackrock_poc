"StruXture is a highly respected firm and this opportunity will not only allow their clients to have expanded services offerings under one roof, but provide ISG additional expertise that that will build upon our soon to be 45 years of industry experience. It really comes down to sustainability and providing our combined clients more horsepower and expertise," Chad affirms.
