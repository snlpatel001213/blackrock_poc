J.P. Morgan Private Bank is telling clients to buy the next sell-off, and the odds are high it'll happen this year. 
Patrick Schaffer, a generally bullish global investment specialist at the firm, says a correction as deep as 14 percent would not surprise him. 
"We don't expect the markets to go up in a straight line. When we do see volatility , we would be prepared to buy those pullbacks," Schaffer said Wednesday on CNBC's " Trading Nation ." 
The stock market hasn't seen a 10 percent or more sell-off in two years — an unusually long stretch even for a bull market. 
If the Dow suffers a 14 percent blow now, it would take the index down nearly 3,500 points. The S&P 500 would fall by 380 points, based on Wednesday's close. 
What could spark it? Schaffer believes a geopolitical event or a more aggressive Federal Reserve could be catalysts. 
But he doesn't see the pain sticking around because the tax overhaul and global backdrop are positive for stocks — particularly financials, industrials and parts of health care. 
Schaffer, who manages more than $150 billion in assets, sees robust earnings as the rally's main driver now. According to his calculations, tax reform adds another 10 to 12 percent to S&P 500 earnings. 
"The fundamental backdrop is as strong today as it's been at any point during this cycle," Schaffer said. " We think we can exit the year in the neighborhood of 3,000 in the S&P 500."
