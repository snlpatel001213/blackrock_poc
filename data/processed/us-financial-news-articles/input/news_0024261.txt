MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian investigators opened a criminal case into a knife attack at a school in the city of Perm on Monday which left 15 people injured, three of whom the authorities said were in a serious condition in hospital. 
Media reports initially said two masked men armed with knives had burst into the school and attacked pupils, but authorities in Perm, about 700 miles north-east of Moscow, said the attack grew out of a knife fight between two pupils. 
Local security authorities said in a statement that other pupils and a female teacher had tried to break up the fight. 
They said twelve people had been taken to a local childrenâ€™s hospital and a further three, including the teacher and two pupils aged 15-16, were in a serious condition at a different hospital. 
Investigators said they had detained the suspects. The school, where almost 700 children studied, had been evacuated, the authorities said. Reporting by Andrew Osborn; Editing by Jack Stubbs
