THE WOODLANDS, Texas, Huntsman Corporation (NYSE: HUN) is raising fourth quarter 2017 expectations due to its global MDI Urethanes business showing stronger than expected demand and margins in the fourth quarter despite typical seasonality. The robust strength in MDI Urethanes was somewhat offset by a weaker than expected quarter in its Performance Products division partially due to unplanned outages and weather related issues in the Gulf Coast region, which have since been fully resolved. Performance Products EBITDA is now expected to be down versus the prior year pro forma EBITDA of $61 million, adjusted for the sale of its European surfactants business. For the fourth quarter 2017 Huntsman Corporation expects to report total adjusted EBITDA modestly above the third quarter 2017 adjusted EBITDA of $340 million.
Huntsman will hold a conference call to discuss its fourth quarter 2017 financial results on Friday, February 23, 2018 at 10:00 a.m. ET. Fourth quarter 2017 results will be released to the public at approximately 6:00 a.m. ET that day via PR Newswire.
