The agency said that its review would entail evaluating Sinclair’s offer of divestitures, and that because the agency would need an opportunity “to fully review them,” it paused its informal 180-day transaction clock. 
Rupert Murdoch-controlled Twenty-First Century Fox Inc ( FOXA.O ) is in talks to buy about 10 television stations from Sinclair as part of the divestiture, two sources familiar with the situation told Reuters this week. Reporting by Diane Bartz, editing by G Crosse
