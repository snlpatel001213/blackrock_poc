Lockheed Martin reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter revenue on Monday, helped by higher sales from the F-35 fighter jet program, while also forecasting a rise in earnings in 2018.
The U.S. defense contractor took a $1.9 billion charge in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, mainly due to the change in U.S. tax law.
On an adjusted basis, however, Lockheed earned $4.30 per share in the quarter.
Net sales rose to $15.14 billion from $13.75 billion a year earlier compared with $14.72 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
Adjusted for new accounting standards from Jan. 1, Lockheed said it expects 2018 net sales in the range of $50.00 billion-$51.50 billion and earnings per share of $15.20-$15.50.
Lockheed, like its peers in the United States , is expected to gain from an increase in defense spending under President Donald Trump 's administration.
The U.S. Defense Department expects to spend some $391 billion over 15 years to develop and buy 2,456 of the supersonic warplanes.
Lockheed said sales in its aeronautics business, its biggest, grew 11.8 percent to $6.05 billion.
