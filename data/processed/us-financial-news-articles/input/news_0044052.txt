Amazon is getting into more brick-and-mortar stores. While the retail giant purchased Whole Foods last year, Amazon had previously opened up a convenience store for employees under its own brand in Seattle in 2016.
Amazon Go was supposed to be a cashierless, checkout-line-free store to help get people in and out faster — a convenience store of the future. But while Amazon employees have been able to use the store for the past year or so, it had failed to open to the public. Until now.
Recode Senior Editor Jason Del Rey recently got a look at the store , which is located at the bottom of Amazon's main office tower in Seattle, before it opens to the public on Monday, Jan. 22. Let's take a look.
You scan a special Amazon Go app on the way in to get access to the store. On the way out, you just walk out — no scanning.
