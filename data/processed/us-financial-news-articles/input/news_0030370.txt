(Corrects headline and third paragraph to clarify timing of UBM share price move)
Jan 16 (Reuters) - British business media group Informa and events organiser UBM said on Tuesday they are in talks on a possible share and cash merger of the two companies.
The two FTSE 250 groups said they were in preliminary talks about details of the combination and there was no certainty that any firm offer would be made.
UBM’s shares rose over 5 percent, while Informa’s stock remained largely unchanged.
Informa will have until 5pm local time on Feb. 13 to make an offer or walk away for at least six months, in reference to UK Takeover Code rules.
In 2008, similar plans to merge the two companies to create a business-to-business media group worth 3 billion pounds ($4.13 billion) did not go ahead.
