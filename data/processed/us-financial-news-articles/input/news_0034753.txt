For the full year of 2017, operating net income per diluted common share (non-GAAP) was $0.93, which excludes the after-tax impact of merger-related expenses of $37.7 million, the after-tax impact of merger-related net securities gains of $1.7 million and the previously mentioned reduction in the valuation of net deferred tax assets of $54.0 million. In comparison, full-year 2016 operating net income per diluted common share (non-GAAP) was $0.90, excluding the after-tax impact of $24.9 million of merger-related expenses.

Total revenue increased 1.3% to $295 million, reflecting a 2.1% increase in net interest income and a 1.6% decrease in non-interest income. Non-interest income declined $1.0 million or 1.6%, attributable to $2.8 million of lower net securities gains. The efficiency ratio on an operating basis (non-GAAP) was stable at 53.1%, compared to 53.1%. Annualized net charge-offs were 0.22% of total average loans, compared to 0.24% in the third quarter of 2017 and 0.31% in the year-ago quarter.

Fourth Quarter 2017 Results – Comparison to Prior Quarter
Net interest income totaled $230.0 million, increasing $4.8 million or 2.1%. The net interest margin (FTE) (non-GAAP) expanded 5 basis points to 3.49% and included $4.7 million of incremental purchase accounting accretion and $5.3 million of cash recoveries, compared to $2.2 million and $4.3 million, respectively, in the prior quarter. Total average earning assets increased $227 million, or 3.4% annualized, due to average loan growth of $158 million and a $130 million increase in average securities.
Average loans totaled $20.8 billion and increased $158 million, or 3.0% annualized, reflecting continuing loan growth in the commercial and consumer portfolios. Average commercial loan growth totaled $44 million, or 1.3% annualized, as strong commercial origination volume was partially offset by reduction in acquired commercial loan balances. Average consumer loan growth was $114 million, or 5.9% annualized, led by continued growth in residential mortgage and indirect auto loans.
Average deposits totaled $22.2 billion and increased $1.0 billion, or 19.0% annualized, due to growth in non-interest bearing deposits, interest bearing transaction deposits and time deposits. The loan to deposit ratio ended December 31, 2017 at 93.7%, compared to 94.9% at September 30, 2017.
Non-interest income totaled $65.1 million, decreasing 1.6% from the prior quarter. The decrease was driven by $2.8 million of lower net securities gains. Capital markets increased $2.1 million from the prior quarter, reflecting increased commercial swap activity during the fourth quarter. Mortgage banking income of $5.6 million reflects continued strong purchase origination volume and includes increased contributions from our Carolina markets.
Non-interest expense totaled $166.5 million, an increase of 1.7% compared to the prior quarter. The fourth quarter included $1.1 million of merger-related expenses, compared to $1.4 million of merger-related expenses in the third quarter. The primary driver of the linked-quarter increase in non-interest expense was a 4.4% increase in personnel expense primarily related to variable compensation across business lines. The efficiency ratio (non-GAAP) was stable at 53.1%.
The ratio of non-performing loans and OREO to total loans and OREO improved 4 basis points to 0.66%. For the originated portfolio, the ratio of non-performing loans and OREO to total loans and OREO improved 10 basis points to 0.81%. Total delinquency remains at satisfactory levels, and total originated delinquency, defined as total past due and non-accrual originated loans as a percentage of total originated loans, improved 3 basis points to 0.88%, compared to 0.91% at September 30, 2017.
The provision for loan losses totaled $16.7 million, compared to $16.8 million in the prior quarter. Net charge-offs totaled $11.3 million, or 0.22% annualized of total average loans, compared to $12.5 million, or 0.24% annualized in the prior quarter. For the originated portfolio, net charge-offs were $13.1 million, or 0.35% annualized of total average originated loans, compared to $13.0 million or 0.37% annualized. The ratio of the allowance for loan losses to total loans and leases increased to 0.84% at December 31, 2017, from 0.82% at September 30, 2017. For the originated portfolio, the allowance for loan losses to total originated loans was 1.10%, compared to 1.12% at September 30, 2017.
Full Year 2017 Results - Comparison to Prior Year
Net interest income totaled $846.4 million, increasing $234.9 million, or 38.4%, reflecting average earning asset growth of $6.8 billion, or 36.9%, due to organic growth and the benefit of acquisitions. The net interest margin (FTE) (non-GAAP) expanded 5 basis points to 3.43% and included $4.0 million of higher incremental purchase accounting accretion and $4.4 million of higher cash recoveries compared to the full year of 2016.
Average loans totaled $19.5 billion, an increase of $5.3 billion, or 36.8%, due to the benefit from continued organic loan growth and acquired balances. Organic growth in total average loans equaled $918 million, or 6.3%. Total average organic consumer loan growth of $609 million, or 10.4%, was led by strong growth in residential mortgage and indirect auto loans. Organic growth in average commercial loans totaled $309 million, or 3.6%. Average deposits totaled $20.4 billion and increased $5.1 billion, or 32.9%, due to the benefit of acquired balances and average organic growth of $506 million or 3.2%. On an organic basis, average total transaction deposits increased $479 million or 3.7%.
Non-interest income totaled $252.4 million, increasing $50.7 million or 25.1%. Non-interest income primarily reflects the benefit of acquisitions and continued expansion of our fee-based businesses of capital markets, mortgage banking, wealth management and insurance.
Non-interest expense totaled $681.5 million, increasing $170.4 million, or 33.3%. Full year 2017 included merger-related expenses of $56.5 million, compared to $37.4 million in 2016. Excluding merger-related expenses, total non-interest expense increased $151.3 million, or 31.9%, with the increase primarily attributable to the expanded operations from acquisitions. The efficiency ratio (non-GAAP) was 54.2%, compared to 55.4% in 2016.
Credit quality results remained at satisfactory levels. For the originated portfolio, the ratio of non-performing loans and OREO to total loans and OREO was 0.81%, compared to 0.91%. Total originated delinquency was 0.88% at December 31, 2017, a decrease of 16 basis points from 1.04% at December 31, 2016.
The provision for loan losses was $61.1 million for the full year of 2017, compared to $55.8 million for the full year of 2016. Net charge-offs totaled $43.8 million, or 0.22% of total average loans, compared to 0.28%. Net originated charge-offs were 0.33% of total average originated loans, compared to 0.34%. For the originated portfolio, the allowance for loan losses to total originated loans was 1.10%, compared to 1.20% at December 31, 2016. The ratio of the allowance for loan losses to total loans decreased 22 basis points to 0.84%, with the decline due to acquired loan balances which were initially recorded at fair value without a corresponding allowance for loan losses in accordance with accounting for business combinations.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Key Performance Indicators
We use non-GAAP financial measures, such as operating net income available to common stockholders, operating net income per diluted common share, return on average tangible common equity, return on average tangible assets, tangible book value per common share, the ratio of tangible common equity to tangible assets, efficiency ratio, and net interest margin (FTE) to provide information useful to investors in understanding our operating performance and trends, and to facilitate comparisons with the performance of our peers. Management uses these measures internally to assess and better understand our underlying business performance and trends related to core business activities. The non-GAAP financial measures and key performance indicators we use may differ from the non-GAAP financial measures and key performance indicators other financial institutions use to measure their performance and trends.
Non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative for, our reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP. In the event of disclosure or release of non-GAAP financial measures, the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) Regulation G requires: (i) the presentation of the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP and (ii) a reconciliation of the differences between the non-GAAP financial measure presented and the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP (included in the tables at the end of this release).
Management believes merger expenses are not organic costs to run our operations and facilities. These charges principally represent expenses to satisfy contractual obligations of the acquired entity without any useful benefit to us and to convert and consolidate the entity's records, systems and data onto our platforms and professional fees related to the transaction. These costs are specific to each individual transaction and may vary significantly based on the size and complexity of the transaction.
For the calculation of net interest margin and the efficiency ratio, net interest income amounts are reflected on a fully taxable equivalent (FTE) basis which adjusts for the tax benefit of income on certain tax-exempt loans and investments using the federal statutory tax rate of 35% for each period presented. We use these measures to provide an economic view believed to be the preferred industry measurement for these items and provide relevant comparison between taxable and non-taxable amounts.

(2)
Includes all other real estate owned, including those balances acquired through business combinations that have been in acquired loans prior to foreclosure.
(3)
"Originated Portfolio" or "Originated Loans and Leases" equals loans and leases not included by definition in the Acquired Portfolio.
(4)
"Acquired Portfolio" or "Acquired Loans" equals loans acquired at fair value, accounted for in accordance with ASC 805 which was effective January 1, 2009. The risk of credit loss on these loans has been considered by virtue of our estimate of acquisition-date fair value and these loans are considered accruing as we primarily recognize interest income through accretion of the difference between the carrying value of these loans and their expected cash flows. Because acquired loans are initially recorded at an amount estimated to be collectible, losses on such loans, when incurred, are first applied against the non-accretable difference established in purchase accounting and then to any allowance for loan losses recognized subsequent to acquisition.
(5)
Represents contractual balances.
