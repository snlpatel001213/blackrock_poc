Metlife previewed earnings on Monday that fell far short of Wall Street expectations and rescheduled its fourth-quarter release. 
The company said it sees adjusted earnings between 61 cents and 66 cents a share. 
Shares of Metlife dropped as much as 10 percent in after-hours trade. They have since recovered some of those losses, but were still trading about 5 percent below their closing price of $54.40.
