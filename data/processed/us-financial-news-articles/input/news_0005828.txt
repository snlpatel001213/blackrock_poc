Dec 28 (Reuters) - Kala Pharmaceuticals Inc on Friday reported mixed results from two late-stage trials testing its drug to provide temporary relief from the signs and symptoms of dry eye disease. 
The drug, KPI-121, met the main goals of reducing redness and discomfort in the eye in one trial, but failed to show statistical significance on a scale that tested patientsâ€™ eyes using a corneal staining technique. 
The second trial met the main goal of reducing a sign of dry eye, but failed another main goal of reducing discomfort in the eye, a symptom of the disorder. Reporting by Manas Mishra and Tamara Mathias in Bengaluru; Editing by Martina D'Couto
