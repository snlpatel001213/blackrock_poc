MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif., Jan. 08, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- IRIDEX Corporation (Nasdaq:IRIX) today provided preliminary operational and financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 30, 2017.
Highlights
Total revenue for the fourth quarter of 2017 expected to be $11.0 to $11.1 million Total revenue for 2017 expected to be $42.3 to $42.4 million Approximately 133 Cyclo G6 glaucoma laser systems and 10,600 G6 probes were shipped in the fourth quarter of 2017 Approximately 377 Cyclo G6 glaucoma laser systems and 32,100 G6 probes were shipped in 2017
"I’m encouraged by the momentum of our G6 platform in the second half of 2017. In the fourth quarter we set records for G6 system and G6 probe shipments, which was primarily driven by our performance in the U.S. market. Our retina business in the fourth quarter had nice demand but was impacted by some product shipment issues which impacted our total revenues. We are working diligently to address those issues,” said William M. Moore, President and CEO. “The impact of the G6 platform on our sales model has been meaningful, as it continues to positively transform our business and importantly, the way physicians are able to treat their glaucoma patients. We plan to continue our focus on the opportunity we see with our G6 platform.”
IRIDEX expects to release its complete fourth quarter and full year 2017 results in early March 2018, at which time, the Company plans to provide guidance for full year 2018.
