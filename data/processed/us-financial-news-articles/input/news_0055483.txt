It was forecast to earn $1.50 a share on revenue of $508.6 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. 
“Our industry is at an inflection point where cyber-attacks are becoming increasingly more sophisticated and security infrastructure needs to significantly advance to effectively combat these threats.
