Declares Quarterly Dividend of $0.10 Per Share.
GREENWICH, Conn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Interactive Brokers Group, Inc. (NASDAQ GS: IBKR) an automated global electronic broker and market maker, today reported a diluted loss per share on a comprehensive basis of $0.02 for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, compared to a diluted loss per share on a comprehensive basis of $0.05 for the same period in 2016. Excluding other comprehensive income, the Company reported a diluted loss per share of $0.02 for the quarter, compared to diluted earnings per share of $0.07 for the same period in 2016. The results for the quarter were negatively impacted by the effects of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”), enacted on December 22, 2017, which decreased diluted earnings per share by $0.45.
Net revenues were $515 million and income before income taxes was $364 million this quarter, compared to net revenues of $193 million and income before income taxes of $28 million for the same period in 2016. The results for the quarter were positively impacted by strong growth in net interest income, which increased $66 million, or 48%, and higher commissions, which increased $20 million, or 13% from the year-ago quarter. Trading gains decreased 64% from the year-ago quarter on lower market making trading volumes as we completed the transfer of our U.S. options market making business to Two Sigma Securities, LLC in the third quarter of 2017.
In addition, the results for the quarter include a $6 million gain on our currency diversification strategy, compared to a $152 million loss in the same period in 2016; and a $9 million net mark-to-market loss on our U.S. government securities portfolio, compared to an $11 million net mark-to-market loss in the same period in 2016.
The Tax Act significantly revised U.S. corporate income tax law by, among other things, reducing the corporate income tax rate to 21% and implementing a modified territorial tax system that includes a one-time transition tax on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries. As a result of the Tax Act, this quarter includes a net reduction in consolidated earnings of approximately $84 million, of which $62 million is due to the one-time repatriation tax and a net $22 million is related to the remeasurement of U.S. deferred tax assets at lower enacted corporate tax rates. The impact of the Tax Act recognized this quarter may materially differ due to, among other things, changes in interpretations and assumptions the Company has made, guidance that may be issued and actions the Company may take as a result of the Tax Act.
For the year ended December 31, 2017, comprehensive diluted earnings per share were $1.22, compared to comprehensive diluted earnings per share of $1.19 in 2016. Excluding other comprehensive income, the Company reported diluted earnings per share of $1.07 for 2017, compared to diluted earnings per share of $1.25 in 2016. The results for 2017 were negatively impacted by the effects of the Tax Act, which decreased diluted earnings per share by $0.46. Net revenues were $1,702 million and income before income taxes was $1,049 million for 2017, compared to net revenues of $1,396 million and income before income taxes of $761 million in 2016.
The Interactive Brokers Group, Inc. Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.10 per share. This dividend is payable on March 14, 2018 to shareholders of record as of March 1, 2018.
