“The enemy now repeatedly makes moves and they are defeated each time,” Khamenei said. “It’s because of the resistance, because of the strong populist and national dam.” 
Protests criticising the economic and political situation spread to more than 80 cities since late December and at least 21 people died. Reporting by Babak Dehghanpisheh; Editing by Robin Pomeroy
