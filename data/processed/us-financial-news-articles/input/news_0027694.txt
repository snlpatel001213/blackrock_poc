LONDON, Jan 18 (Reuters) - Spanish government bond yields moved to their tightest level over German peers in over five months on Thursday, a move analysts attributed to speculation over a potential ratings upgrade for Spain by Fitch Ratings.
Fitch is due to review Spainâ€™s credit rating late on Friday and many analysts believe the agency could upgrade Spain, which is currently rated BBB+, helped by a strengthening economy and fading political risks.
The gap between Spanish and German 10-year government bond yields narrowed to 96 basis points, its tightest level since August 2017 . (Reporting by Abhinav Ramnarayan, Editing by Dhara Ranasinghe)
