T. Boone Pickens, a famous oilman and investment manager, said he is closing the energy-focused hedge fund he has run for the last two decades as his health declines. 
The move closes a chapter in a nearly seven-decade career that has included stints as a wildcatter, corporate raider, cattle trader and clean-energy evangelist. 
The 89-year-old Oklahoma native cited both his deteriorating health and weak financial performance as reasons for closing the fund, according to a letter that he plans to publish soon and was reviewed by The Wall Street Journal. Pickens said he is recovering from a series of strokes last year and a bad fall. 
“It’s no secret the past year has not been good to me, from a health perspective or a financial one,” he wrote in the letter. “If you are lucky enough to make it to 89 years of age like I have, those things tend to put life in perspective.”
