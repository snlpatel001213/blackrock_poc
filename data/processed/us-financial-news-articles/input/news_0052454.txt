MOSCOW, Jan 30 (Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury Department on Tuesday named major Russian businessmen including the heads of the two biggest banks, metals magnates and the boss of the state gas monopoly on a list of oligarchs close to the Kremlin.
The list, drawn up as part of a sanctions package signed into law in August last year, does not mean those included will be subject to sanctions, but it casts a shadow of sanctions risk over a wide circle of wealthy Russians, including many outside President Vladimir Putinâ€™s immediate circle.
