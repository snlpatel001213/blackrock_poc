SAN JOSE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Western Digital Corporation (NASDAQ: WDC) (“Western Digital” or the “company”) today announced that it has priced its concurrent offerings of $2.3 billion aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes due 2026 (the “2026 notes”) and $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes due 2024 (the “2024 convertible notes” and, together with the 2026 notes, the “notes”). The notes will be issued by Western Digital, and guaranteed, jointly and severally on a senior basis, by certain of Western Digital’s subsidiaries.
The 2026 notes were offered in a public offering, and will bear interest at a rate of 4.750% per annum. Western Digital intends to use the net proceeds of the 2026 notes offering, together with available cash on hand, to fund its concurrent cash tender (the “tender offer”) to purchase any and all of its currently outstanding 10.500% senior unsecured notes due 2024. BofA Merrill Lynch and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC are acting as lead book-running managers, and RBC Capital Markets, Mizuho Securities and Wells Fargo Securities are acting as book-running managers for the 2026 notes offering.
The 2024 convertible notes were offered in a private offering to only qualified institutional investors (“QIBs”) in accordance with Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), and will bear interest at a rate of 1.50% per annum. The company granted the initial purchasers a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional $100 million aggregate principal amount of 2024 convertible notes. The company intends to use the net proceeds of the offering of the 2024 convertible notes, together with the net proceeds from the previously announced Term Loan A-1 facility and available cash on hand, to redeem all of its currently outstanding 7.375% senior secured notes due 2023 (the “2023 secured notes”), including all accrued interest, related premiums, fees, and expenses. The 2024 convertible notes will be convertible into cash, shares of Western Digital’s common stock or a combination thereof, at Western Digital’s election, at an initial conversion price of approximately $121.91 per share (which represents a premium of approximately 40% to the $87.08 per share closing price of Western Digital’s common stock on Jan. 30, 2018). The company may redeem all or part of the 2024 convertible notes, at its option, on or after Feb. 5, 2021 if the company’s common stock price has been at least 130% of the conversion price for at least 10 trading days out of a 20-day consecutive trading period.
The company agreed to repurchase approximately $153.5 million of its common stock concurrently with the offering of the 2024 convertible notes offering in privately negotiated transactions, at a purchase price per share equal to the $87.08 per share closing price of Western Digital’s common stock on Jan. 30, 2018 with available cash on hand.
The sale of both the 2026 notes and the 2024 convertible notes is expected to be completed on Feb. 13, 2018, subject to customary closing conditions.
The 2024 convertible notes, the common stock, if any, deliverable upon conversion of the 2024 convertible notes and the related guarantees have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction. They may not be offered or sold in the United States or to, or for the benefit of, U.S. persons absent registration under, or an applicable exemption from, the registration requirements of the Securities Act.
The 2026 notes and 2024 convertible notes offerings are being conducted as separate offerings. Neither offering is contingent upon the other.
The company has filed a registration statement (including a prospectus) with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) for the 2026 notes offering.
