MILAN, Jan 30 (Reuters) - Telecom Italia’s proposal for a separation of its network assets into a separate company fully controlled by the group includes having a representative of Italy’s communications regulator on the unit’s board, a source said on Tuesday.
The proposal will be presented to the Italian Industry Minister on Feb. 7, the source said. (Reporting by Stefano Rebaudo; editing by Agnieszka Flak)
