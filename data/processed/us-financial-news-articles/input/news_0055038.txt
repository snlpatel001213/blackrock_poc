(Reuters) - Symantec Corp’s ( SYMC.O ) quarterly revenue rose 16 percent, helped by strong demand for its cyber-security software.
The maker of Norton antivirus said on Wednesday its net income rose to $1.34 billion or $2.01 per share in the third quarter ended Dec. 29 from $46 million or 7 cents per share, a year earlier.
The big jump in net income reflected a more than $600 million gain related to the sale of a business.
Revenue rose to $1.21 billion from $1.04 billion.
Demand for cyber-security products has remained strong following back-to-back security incidents such as the “WannaCry” malware that infected computers in more than 100 countries last year and data breaches at major companies.
