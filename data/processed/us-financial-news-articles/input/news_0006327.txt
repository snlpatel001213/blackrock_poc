LOS ANGELES, Jan. 4, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Rexford Industrial Realty, Inc. (the "Company" or "Rexford Industrial") (NYSE: REXR), a real estate investment trust focused on owning and operating industrial properties located in Southern California infill markets, today announced the acquisition of a four property industrial portfolio for approximately $62.7 million. The acquisitions were completed during the fourth quarter of 2017 and were funded using cash on hand, draws on the Company's line of credit and proceeds from a $2.4 million disposition.
"These acquisitions contribute 416,843 square feet of 100% leased product in prime, supply-constrained infill Southern California with favorable NOI growth potential as below-market in-place leases roll over the next twenty months," stated Howard Schwimmer and Michael Frankel, Co-Chief Executive Officers of the Company. "As we continue to capitalize upon our regional consolidation opportunity, we closed the year with $667 million of acquisitions and recycled approximately $99 million of capital through dispositions. Driven by our proprietary, research-driven acquisition platform, we continue to generate attractive opportunities to acquire value-add and leased industrial property as we execute our internal and external growth strategies focused on driving cash flow and shareholder value."
The Company acquired 302 S. Rockefeller Avenue and 4355 E.
