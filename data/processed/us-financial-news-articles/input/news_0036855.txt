SEOUL, Jan 23 (Reuters) - South Koreaâ€™s LG Display Co Ltd said on Tuesday its annual operating profit for 2017 reached 2.5 trillion won ($2.34 billion), up 88 percent from the previous year.
The increase was due to rising prices for large liquid crystal display (LCD) panels during the first half of the year as well as a more diversified product lineup, LG Display said in a regulatory filing.
