TOKYO, Jan 24 (Reuters) - Japanese government bond prices edged higher on Wednesday, with the Bank of Japan’s stance towards maintaining its easy policy providing support.
March 10-year JGB futures rose 0.06 point to 150.53.
The 20-year JGB yield dipped half a basis point to 0.580 percent.
The BOJ kept monetary settings unchanged as expected on Tuesday and Governor Haruhiko Kuroda hosed down market speculation of a shift away from ultra-easy policy later this year as inflation remained stubbornly shy of the central bank’s target.
JGBs also drew a mild lift as Japanese equities slipped from 26-year peaks, with the Nikkei last down 0.6 percent. (Reporting by the Tokyo markets team; Editing by Jacqueline Wong)
