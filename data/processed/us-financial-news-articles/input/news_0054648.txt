WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump’s re-election campaign will offer donors a chance to see their name flashed on the livestream of his first State of the Union address, according to a solicitation on his campaign website on Monday. 
For a payment of at least $35, contributors’ names will be displayed on Trump’s campaign website during the speech to the U.S. Congress, scheduled for 9 p.m. EST on Tuesday/0200 GMT on Wednesday. 
”This is a movement,“ the website offer says. ”It’s not about just one of us. It’s about ALL of us. Which is why your name deserves to be displayed during Tuesday night’s speech.” 
The web page allows donors to give as much as $2,700, the maximum allowed per election. 
In his speech, Trump is expected to tout the economy and recently enacted tax cuts while also emphasizing his calls for tougher immigration policies and for an infrastructure package. Reporting by Eric Walsh; Editing by Sandra Maler and Caren Bohan
