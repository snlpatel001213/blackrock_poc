Drilling and completion capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2017 were approximately $460 million. During the fourth quarter the Company chose to retain its interest in multiple non-operated wells located within SRC's core operating area which began producing late in Q4 2017. These wells represented approximately $35 million in non-operated drilling and completion capital expenditures in 2017. Given the timing of these wells, they had limited impact on SRC's 2017 production volumes; however, they should have a more measurable impact on 2018 production volumes.
Operations Update
During the quarter ended December 31, 2017, SRC drilled 27 gross (~25 net) wells and completed 12 gross (~11 net) wells. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, the Company drilled 115 gross (~103 net) wells and completed 115 gross (~102 net) wells.

The Company expects full year 2018 production to be between 48,000 BOE/d and 52,000 BOE/d with oil making up 47% - 50% of production. The pace of completion activity is anticipated to be skewed towards the latter half of 2018 to align with natural gas processing capacity additions. Total drilling and completion capital expenditures are projected to be between $480 million and $540 million. In 2018 SRC expects to drill approximately 117 gross (100 net) wells and complete approximately 116 gross (103 net) wells on an operated basis. SRC's operational program for 2018 is similar to the program executed in 2017. The expected year-over-year capital expenditure increase is a function of productivity gains with respect to SRC's contiguous block of acreage, larger average working interest and anticipated cost pressures. Crude oil differentials, which include all transportation and gathering costs from the wellhead to the settlement point, are expected to remain relatively stable within a range of $6.00 to $6.50 per barrel.
Management Comment
Lynn A. Peterson, Chairman and CEO of SRC Energy commented, "Our team's execution through 2017 was very positive. We have continued our strong operational momentum into 2018, which should lead to an alignment of SRC's operating cash flow with capital expenditures while continuing to deliver robust year-over-year growth."
Mr. Peterson added, “As it relates to midstream infrastructure, 2018 will be a year of change. Multiple gas processing facilities as well as oil gathering assets are currently under construction or are on the drawing boards as midstream companies respond to the growing needs.” He concluded, “As good stewards of SRC’s capital, we intend to maintain our strong balance sheet and operational flexibility, while focusing on delivering favorable returns on capital for our shareholders.”
