Submitted applications for all Medicare products grew 16% during the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to the fourth quarter a year ago. For the full year 2017 submitted Medicare applications grew 10% compared to 2016.
Submitted applications for individual and family plan (IFP) products declined 23% during the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to the fourth quarter a year ago. For the full year 2017 submitted IFP applications declined 51% compared to 2016. The decline in IFP submitted applications was partially offset through eHealth’s strategy of offering non-ACA compliant packages of health insurance benefits to address a broader spectrum of consumer needs and income levels. During the fourth quarter of 2017 there were approximately 7,200 submitted applications for packages.
“We are pleased with our financial performance during the quarter and for the full year 2017,” commented Scott Flanders, chief executive officer of eHealth. “A return to financial and operating discipline under the new leadership team has been an important goal for the company as we have worked to transform the business during this transition year for eHealth. In the important Medicare business unit, we posted 17% application growth in the second half of the year, but fell short of our targets for annual application growth in the ‘high teens.’ Our strategy of focusing on strategic partnerships in addition to traditional marketing efforts has resulted in meaningful progress in driving growth on a more attractive cost basis, but the slower than expected roll-out of selected partner relationships relative to plan caused us to fall short of our submitted application objectives for the year.”
“The individual and family market remained challenged during the Open Enrollment Period occurring during the fourth quarter,” continued Flanders. “We saw an increase in submitted applications for qualified health plans compared to the fourth quarter of 2016, driven in part by the new Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services enrollment framework that allowed us to enroll subsidy-eligible customers into qualified health plans through the Federal exchange without the customers having to leave our website. At the same time, we experienced a decline in non-subsidized plan applications as a result of premium inflation and lack of inventory across the market, among other factors.”
These preliminary, unaudited results are based on management's initial review of operations for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, and remain subject to change based on management's ongoing review of the fourth-quarter results. eHealth anticipates providing its full financial and operating results for 2017, as well as financial guidance for 2018 and an update on its adoption of the new ASC 606 revenue recognition standard, on or about March 1, 2018.
