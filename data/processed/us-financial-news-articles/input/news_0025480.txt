LONDON (Reuters) - Britain scrambled two Royal Air Force Typhoon jets on Monday from Scotland to intercept Russian planes near the United Kingdom’s airspace, a defence ministry spokesman said. 
The Typhoons were scrambled from RAF Lossiemouth in Moray, Scotland. 
“This is a live operation and therefore we will not be providing any additional information until the mission is complete,” the spokesman said. Reporting by Alistair Smout; editing by Guy Faulconbridge
