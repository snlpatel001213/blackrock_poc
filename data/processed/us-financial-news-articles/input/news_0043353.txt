TOKYO, Jan 24 (Reuters) - Japan Airlines Co (JAL) said on Wednesday that President Yoshiharu Ueki, who helped lead the companyâ€™s recovery from bankruptcy, will be replaced by managing executive officer Yuji Akasaka in April.
Ueki, a former pilot who was named president in 2012, is credited for helping revitalising the once-bankrupt carrier by slashing costs and clinching code-sharing deals.
He will become chairman, while Akasaka, currently in charge of engineering and maintenance, will become the new president, the company said. (Reporting by Minami Funakoshi; Editing by Edwina Gibbs)
