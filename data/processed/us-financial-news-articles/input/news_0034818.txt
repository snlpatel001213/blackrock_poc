The Beast noted that the compromised version of the book, in PDF format, has only a little over 230 pages, instead of the 328 pages in the official version.

Itâ€™s intriguing that the discovery of the malware came from a researcher with Kaspersky Labs. The Russian-headquartered cybersecurity firm has recently faced allegations that it is linked to Russian intelligence services . According to U.S. intelligence reports, those agencies interfered with U.S. election systems and online news, in ways that appear to have been broadly supportive of Trumpâ€™s candidacy. The U.S. government recently banned the use of Kaspersky products by its agencies. 
To avoid being a hackerâ€™s plaything, readers should stick to official e-book versions of Fire and Fury , as sold by Amazon and other retailers. Torrent sites serving pirated material infect as many as 12 million users a month with malware. SPONSORED FINANCIAL CONTENT
