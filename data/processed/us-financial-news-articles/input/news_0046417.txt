TOKYO, Jan 25 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar dropped more than 0.3 percent versus the Swiss franc to hit its lowest level since August 2015, as the U.S. currency came under pressure after U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said he welcomed a cheaper currency.
The dollar fell to as low as 0.9421 franc.
