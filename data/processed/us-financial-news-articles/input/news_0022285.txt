PARIS, Jan 15 (Reuters) - Toulon owner Mourad Boudjellal said he feared the “mormon side” of European Professional Club Rugby (EPCR) after Mathieu Bastareaud was cited for making a homophobic comment during Sunday’s Champions Cup win over Benetton Treviso. 
France centre Bastareaud apologised on social media and was defended by Boudjellal. 
“At no point did Mathieu Bastareaud make a judgement on the sexual orientation of the player in question,” Boudjellal told rugbyrama.fr. 
“I am not homophobic but I have already called someone a faggot. It’s become customary, it’s the first thing that comes to mind in an altercation.” 
Boudjellal fears his player will be heavily punished. 
“I am worried. What I fear is the mormon side of EPCR with the Welsh and the Irish,” he said. (Reporting by Julien Pretot,; Editing by Ed Osmond)
