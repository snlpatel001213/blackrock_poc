ZURICH (Reuters) - Nestle ( NESN.S ) is the frontrunner to buy Merck KGaA’s ( MRCG.DE ) consumer health unit that could fetch as much as $5 billion, financial news service Bloomberg said on Wednesday, quoting unidentified sources familiar with the matter. 
Bloomberg said Nestle had submitted the highest offer and Merck was likely to select a winner during the first quarter, but might also choose not to sell the assets after all. 
It quoted sources saying that generic drugmaker Perrigo ( PRGO.N ) and the private equity owners of German drug firm Stada ( STAGn.DE ) had dropped out of the process, while Reckitt Benckiser Group Plc ( RB.L ) and Mylan NV ( MYL.O ) were still suitors for the business. 
A spokeswoman for Nestle said the company was not commenting on rumors. Reporting by Silke Koltrowitz; Editing by Mark Potter
