KINSHASA (Reuters) - At least a dozen soldiers were killed in Democratic Republic of Congoâ€™s volatile eastern borderlands where the army is battling Ugandan Islamist rebels, Congolese security and diplomatic sources said on Friday.
The armies of Congo and Uganda launched a military offensive last month against the Allied Democratic Forces rebels, who were suspected of being behind a Dec. 8 attack on a U.N. base that killed 15 Tanzanian peacekeepers.
