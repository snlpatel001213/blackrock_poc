Duke erased a 13-point second-half hole but didn’t hold the lead for long stretches.
Virginia shot 7-for-9 on free throws, but was 0-for-2 on a pair of front ends of 1-and-1 situations in the final 25 seconds before Guy sank both ends with 6.1 seconds left for a four-point lead.
Marvin Bagley III’s 3-pointer for Duke with 7.4 seconds left closed the gap to 63-61. After Guy’s foul shots, Bagley’s putback at the buzzer accounted for the final score.
Duke was 5-for-11 from the foul line as its five-game winning streak was snapped.
Bagley finished with 30 points and 14 rebounds and Wendell Carter Jr. tallied 14 points and 15 rebounds for Duke (18-3, 6-3), which was charged with 16 turnovers compared to five for the Cavaliers.
It was a matchup pitting a Duke team that leads the nation in scoring and a Virginia team that has the country’s best defensive numbers. The Blue Devils entered the game averaging 91.7 points per outing.
Virginia led 60-55 before Carter made the first of two free-throw attempts at the 2:26 mark to set up the final stretch.
After Jerome’s shot was blocked, Bagley dunked on a baseline move at the other end. Jerome had another chance in the last minute and drilled a dagger.
Duke cut into a 13-point deficit with a 9-0 run early in the second half. Shortly after, a five-point possession helped the Blue Devils to a 41-39 lead.
Virginia led 32-22 at halftime, marking the fewest points in any half this season for Duke. The Blue Devils were without a 3-point basket in the first half.
