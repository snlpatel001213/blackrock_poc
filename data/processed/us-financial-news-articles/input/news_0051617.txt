(Reuters) - Having not played a single game with Paris St Germain this season, former France forward Hatem Ben Arfa says he has the feeling he ‘does not exist’ anymore. 
The 30-year-old joined from Nice in 2016 but after featuring 23 times in Ligue 1 last season, he has been dumped into the reserves this term and his lawyer even threatened legal action last September. 
“What I‘m going through at PSG is very complicated, I have the feeling I don’t exist,” Ben Arfa told French football magazine So Foot. 
”You have to learn to live with that. At some point, my life as a footballer will come to an end, there will be other testing times, like sickness. 
“But learning not to exist anymore after feeling like you existed after what you had done before, it’s hard.” 
After leaving Hull City in January, 2015, Ben Arfa joined Nice for the 2015-16, scoring 17 goals from 34 league matches. 
He has scored two goals from 15 caps with France between 2007-15. Reporting by Julien Pretot; Editing by William Maclean
