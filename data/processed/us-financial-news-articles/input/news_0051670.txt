ANNAPOLIS, Md., Jan. 29, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Severn Bancorp, Inc., ("the Company"),(Nasdaq: SVBI) parent company of Severn Bank ("Severn"), today announced a net loss of $349 thousand or $.03 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to net income of $1.1 million or $.08 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2016. Net income was $2.8 million or $.21 per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to net income of $15.5 million or $1.15 per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2016. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2016 included the removal of the valuation allowance on the deferred tax asset. This led to a gain of $11.8 million being recorded as an income tax benefit. On a pre-tax basis, income was $7.8 million and $5.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
Both fourth quarter and year-end earnings for 2017 were adversely impacted with the signing into law of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the "Act") which was enacted on December 22, 2017 and went into effect January 1, 2018. The Company's net deferred tax asset was based on the previously enacted federal tax rate of 34%. As a result of the reduction in the maximum corporate income tax rate to 21% under the Act, the Company revalued its net deferred tax asset at December 31, 2017. This resulted in a reduction in the value of the net deferred tax asset of approximately $1.9 million, which is recorded as additional income tax expense in the Company's statement of operations for the fourth quarter of 2017. Discounting the impact of the one-time deferred tax asset adjustment the Company would have reported net income of $1.5 million or $.12 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2017 and net income of $4.7 million or $.38 per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2017.
During 2017 the Company experienced loan growth of $57.9 million which was an increase of 9.48%, and achieved $30.3 million worth of deposit growth. Asset quality continues to improve with non-performing assets decreasing from 1.4% of total assets down to 0.8% year over year. The cost of funds decreased significantly with interest on borrowings decreasing 27.6% quarter over quarter and down 20.65% year over year. Higher cost borrowings also decreased by $15.0 million. The Company saw an improvement in its efficiency ratio to 69.42% from 80.97% quarter over quarter and 75.45% compared to 81.64% year over year.
"Our 2017 story is a good one," stated Alan J. Hyatt, President and Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Hyatt continued, "We made strong and steady progress each quarter last year. All of the trends are positive and continue to head in the right direction. Loan growth is strong and deposit growth is good. We are building strong community banking relationships and remain committed to serving Anne Arundel County residents and businesses. More than ever we are dedicated to improving shareholder value and making Severn the premier community bank in the region."
