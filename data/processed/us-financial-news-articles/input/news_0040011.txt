DAVOS, Switzerland (Reuters) - Strong global oil demand will help offset a steep rise in U.S. oil production and prevent oil prices from collapsing again, the energy ministers of Russia and Saudi Arabia said on Wednesday.
Alexander Novak and Khalid al-Falih were speaking at a joint panel at the World Economic Forum in Davos with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry.
Perry also said he believed U.S. shale oil won’t become a “spoiler” for the oil industry as global demand was rising fast.
