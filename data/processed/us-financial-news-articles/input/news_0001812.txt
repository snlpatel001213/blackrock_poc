Park believes that an evaluation of its ongoing operations would be difficult if the disclosure of its financial results were limited to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) financial measures, which include special items, such as restructuring charges, advisory fees and one-time litigation expense. Accordingly, in addition to disclosing its financial results determined in accordance with GAAP, Park discloses non-GAAP operating results that exclude special items in order to assist its shareholders and other readers in assessing the Company’s operating performance, since the Company’s on-going, normal business operations do not include such special items. The detailed operating information presented below reconciles the non-GAAP operating results before special items to earnings determined in accordance with GAAP. Such non-GAAP financial measures are provided to supplement the results provided in accordance with GAAP.
REPAYMENT OF OUTSTANDING DEBT
Park announced the voluntary repayment of all outstanding debt under the Credit Agreement, dated as of January 15, 2016, between the Company and HSBC Bank USA, in the amount of approximately $69 million, including principal and accrued interest, effective January 3, 2018. The Company also announced the termination of the Credit Agreement.
The repayment of the outstanding debt was funded from the Company’s cash balances. The change in the U.S. tax code, as provided by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“Act”), has allowed the Company to repatriate its foreign accumulated income at a lower effective tax rate. The Act, which was passed in December 2017, provides an incentive for United States companies to repatriate accumulated income earned in foreign jurisdictions at a reduced U.S. income tax expense. The estimated income tax expense and related liability associated with the repatriation is approximately $20 million compared to an estimated $60 million in income tax expense that the Company would have incurred if it had repatriated the accumulated foreign income before the effectiveness of the Act. The repatriation of accumulated foreign income will be reported in the fourth quarter of the 2018 fiscal year.
SPECIAL CASH DIVIDEND
Park announced that its Board of Directors has declared a special cash dividend of $3.00 per share payable February 13, 2018 to shareholders of record at the close of business on January 23, 2018. The special cash dividend will be funded from the Company’s cash balances.
This special dividend, together with the Company’s regular quarterly dividend of $0.10 per share payable February 6, 2018 to shareholders of record on January 2, 2018, brings the total amount of dividends paid to shareholders to $20.10 per share, a total of approximately $412 million, since the Company’s 2005 fiscal year.
