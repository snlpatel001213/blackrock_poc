Jan 18 (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc said it has short-listed 20 metropolitan areas, including one in Canada, to build its second headquarters after reviewing 238 proposals. 
The largest e-commerce company said it would work with each of the candidate locations to get more information and evaluate the feasibility of a future partnership. 
Amazon said in September it would build a $5 billion second headquarters in North America, kicking off a competition between cities and states to offer tax cuts and incentives that could bring 50,000 new jobs. (Reporting by Supantha Mukherjee in Bengaluru; Editing by Bernard Orr)
