OKLAHOMA CITY--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Sonic Corp. (NASDAQ: SONC), the nation’s largest chain of drive-in restaurants, today announced results for its first fiscal quarter ended November 30, 2017.
Key highlights of the company’s first quarter of fiscal year 2018 included:
Net income per diluted share increased 4% to $0.29 versus $0.28 in the prior-year period; adjusted net income per diluted share increased 25% to $0.30 versus $0.24 in the prior-year period; System same-store sales declined 1.7%, consisting of a 1.6% same-store sales decrease at franchise drive-ins and a 3.2% decrease at company drive-ins; Company drive-in margins declined 0.1%; 5 new drive-ins opened; and The company repurchased 1.7 million outstanding shares.
“As expected, our first quarter same-store sales declined modestly versus prior year reflecting continued intense competitive pressure and unfavorable weather,” said Cliff Hudson, Sonic Corp. CEO. “Excluding the impact of weather, same-store sales were flat, indicating an improvement in underlying traffic trends.
“During the quarter, we promoted the Carhop Classic for $2.99, featuring our full-sized cheeseburger and medium hand-made onion rings, a value offering with a highly compelling price point, broad consumer appeal and strong quality differentiation. In addition to driving improved traffic, the introduction of a sharper everyday value message also improved value and quality scores from customers, validating our evolution to more focused and consistent national value promotions. We will continue to refine this strategy as we move through the remainder of the fiscal year, seeking to balance everyday value and consistent profitability for franchisees while staying true to Sonic’s core tenets of quality, differentiation and innovation.
“While price competition remains fierce, we are hard at work driving the business in areas we can control. We continue to refine our current media strategies, resulting in increased impressions on national cable today and new creative content in the market this spring. We have growing confidence in our product pipeline as we look out to the key summer season and our mobile order ahead pilot is underway.
“Finally, we continue to optimize our capital structure and return cash to shareholders. During the quarter, we repurchased 1.7 million shares, or 4% of shares outstanding, for $40.8 million. We have increased our targeted leverage range to 3.5-4.5x net-debt-to-EBITDA and anticipate concluding the year at the higher end of the range.”
