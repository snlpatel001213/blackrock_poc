“Currently there is no need,” Mnangagwa said about the possibility of forming a coalition with Tsvangirai’s Movement for Democratic Change. 
Mnangagwa came to power in November last year following a de facto military coup after which veteran leader Robert Mugabe stepped down after 37 years in power. Reporting by Alfonce Mbizwo; Writing by Joe Brock; Editing by Robin Pomeroy
