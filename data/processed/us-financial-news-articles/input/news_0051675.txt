"We're delighted to report record earnings for 2017 after our fourth quarter results cap an extremely strong year for Hawaiian" said Mark Dunkerley, Hawaiian Airlines president and CEO. "Robust demand in all of our major geographies and moderate industry capacity growth offset the rising price of fuel. We carried more guests this year than ever before and set new records for fourth quarter and full year revenue. These results are the product of the tireless efforts of the 6,600 employees who deliver authentic Hawaiian hospitality on the ground and in the air every single day.
Looking ahead, 2018 stands to be a year that Hawaiian enters into the last phase of a strategy mapped out over a decade ago. With new aircraft, new markets, and product enhancements tailored to the needs of the Hawai'i traveler, we are better equipped to compete today than at any time in our past. We look forward to the year ahead and all that it has in store."

First Quarter and Full Year 2018 Outlook
The table below summarizes the Company's expectations for the first quarter ending March 31, 2018 and the full year ending December 31, 2018, expressed as an expected percentage change compared to the pro forma results for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 or the year ended December 31, 2017, as applicable.
In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, and created a new topic (ASC 606), requiring an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. ASC 606 will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in GAAP when it becomes effective. ASC 606 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2017. The Company has elected to adopt the full retrospective transition method as of January 1, 2018, resulting in the restatement of all prior periods on the date of adoption. Metrics in the guidance tables below that have been impacted by ASC 606 are shown as both originally stated and on an unaudited pro forma basis.

The other components of net periodic benefit cost are required to be presented in the income statement separately from the service cost component and outside a subtotal of income from operations, if one is presented. Accounting Standard Update 2017-07 (ASU 2017-07) is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption only permitted for the Company in the first quarter of 2017, provided all provisions of the ASU are adopted. The Company early adopted this standard during the first quarter of 2017. The adoption of ASU 2017-07 resulted in a reclassification of $5.1 million and $20.3 million from wages and benefits to other components of net periodic benefit cost on the Company's consolidated statement of operations for the three months and twelve months ended December 31, 2016, respectively.

Economic Fuel Expense
(in thousands, except per-gallon amounts) (unaudited)
The Company believes that economic fuel expense is a good measure of the effect of fuel prices on its business as it most closely approximates the net cash outflow associated with the purchase of fuel for its operations in a period. The Company defines economic fuel expense as GAAP fuel expense plus losses/(gains) realized through actual cash (receipts)/payments received from or paid to hedge counterparties for fuel hedge derivative contracts settled during the period.

Changes in fair value of derivative contracts, net of tax, are based on market prices for open contracts as of the end of the reporting period. This line item includes the unrealized amounts of fuel and interest rate derivatives (not designated as hedges) that will settle in future periods and the reversal of prior period unrealized amounts. The Company believes that excluding the impact of these derivative adjustments helps investors to analyze the Company's core operational performance and compare its results to other airlines in the periods presented below.
•
Loss on extinguishment of debt, net of tax, is excluded to help investors analyze the Company's core operational performance and compare its results to other airlines in the periods presented below.
•
As a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, the Company recognized a one time benefit of $104.2 million in the quarter ended December 31, 2017 from the estimated impact of the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities. For 2018, the expected reduction in the corporate tax rate will result in an all-in book tax rate for the Company of 24% to 26%.
2016 special items
•
The impairment analysis and ultimate charge was triggered by the decision in the fourth quarter of 2016 to exit the Boeing 767-300 fleet in 2018. The Company estimated the fair value of the owned Boeing 767-300 fleet assets using third party pricing information and Quote: s from potential buyers, which resulted in a $49.4 million impairment charge ($0.92 per diluted share).
•
In 2016, the Company accrued $34.0 million associated with the tentative agreement with ALPA related to past service (prior to January 1, 2017) and also elected to pay a $4.8 million profit sharing bonus payment to other labor groups related to prior period service.
•
In connection with the decision to exit the Boeing 767-300 fleet, the Company negotiated a termination of its Boeing 767-300 maintenance agreement and recorded a $21.0 million charge related to the amount paid to terminate the contract.
2017 special items
•
In August 2017, the Company terminated the Hawaiian Airlines, Inc. Salaried & IAM Merged Pension Plan (the Merged Plan) and settled a portion of its pilots' other post-retirement medical plan liability. In connection with the reduction of these liabilities the Company recorded one-time other nonoperating special items of $35.2 million related to the Merged Plan termination and $10.4 million related to the other post-retirement (OPEB) medical plan partial settlement.
•
In April 2017, the Company executed a sale leaseback transaction with an independent third party for three Boeing 767-300 aircraft. The lease terms for the three aircraft commenced in April 2017 and continues through November 2018, December 2018, and January 2019, respectively. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, the Company recorded a loss on sale of aircraft of $4.8 million.
•
In February 2017, the Company reached a tentative agreement with ALPA, covering the Company's pilots. In March 2017, the Company received notice from ALPA that the agreement was ratified by ALPA's members. The agreement became effective April 1, 2017 and has a term of 63 months. The agreement includes, among other various benefits, a pay adjustment and ratification bonus computed based on previous service. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, the Company expensed $18.7 million related to (1) a one-time payment to reduce the Company's future 401K employer contribution for certain pilot groups, which is not recoverable once paid and (2) a one-time true up of the pilot vacation accrual at the revised rates set forth in the agreement.
The Company believes that excluding such special items helps investors analyze the Company's operational performance and compare its results to other airlines in the periods presented below.

(a)
The other components of net periodic benefit cost are required to be presented in the income statement separately from the service cost component and outside a subtotal of income from operations, if one is presented. Accounting Standard Update 2017-07 (ASU 2017-07) is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption only permitted for the Company in the first quarter of 2017, provided all provisions of the ASU are adopted. The Company early adopted this standard during the first quarter of 2017. The adoption of ASU 2017-07 resulted in a reclassification of $5.1 million and $20.3 million from wages and benefits to other components of net periodic benefit cost on the Company's consolidated statement of operations for the three months and twelve months ended December 31, 2016, respectively.

Leverage ratio
The Company uses adjusted total debt, including aircraft rent, in addition to long-term adjusted debt and capital leases, to represent long-term financial obligations. The Company excludes unrealized (gains) losses from fuel derivative contracts, losses on extinguishment of debt, and special items from earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and rent (EBITDAR) for the reasons as described above. Management believes this metric is helpful to investors in assessing the Company's overall debt.
