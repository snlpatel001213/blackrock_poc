WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer was heading to the White House on Friday to meet President Donald Trump to discuss ways to avert a government shutdown, a source familiar with the situation said.
Trump, a Republican, telephoned Schumer to invite him to the White House, the source said. The U.S. Congress faced a midnight deadline to come up with funding legislation to avoid federal agency shutdowns.
