2017 Operating Highlights:
Consolidated silver production of 25.0 million ounces was within the original guidance range provided in January 2017 (the "Original Guidance") of 24.5 million to 26.0 million ounces. Consolidated gold production of 160 thousand ounces was within the Original Guidance range of 155 thousand to 165 thousand ounces. Annual record set for gold production at Dolores. Record zinc and lead production with lead production beating the Company's Original Guidance and zinc production slightly below the Original Guidance. Copper production beat the Company's Original Guidance. Zinc and copper production were within the revised range provided on November 8, 2017 (the "Revised Guidance") while lead production was slightly above the Revised Guidance. Annual production records were set for zinc and lead at La Colorada. Decade-low annual consolidated Cash Costs of $4.55 were 35% below the midpoint of the Original Guidance of $6.45 to $7.45, and at the low end of the Revised Guidance, largely due to improved productivity at our mines in Peru and Mexico, higher by-product credits from strong base metal production and base metal prices, and improved concentrate treatment costs. Annual Cash Costs records were set at La Colorada, Huaron, Morococha, and Dolores. Construction of the La Colorada mine expansion was completed. Full design processing rates of 1,800 tonnes per day were achieved in mid-2017, about six months ahead of schedule. Average throughput exceeded design rates by about 5% during the last six months of 2017. Construction of the Dolores pulp agglomeration plant was completed and commissioning commenced. Heap leach pad stacking rates achieved 97% of the expanded capacity of 20,000 tonnes per day during the last four months of 2017. Implementation of "Towards Sustainable Mining" ("TSM") was initiated. TSM is a three-year initiative designed to enhance our community engagement processes, drive world-leading environmental practices and reinforce our commitment to the safety and health of our employees and surrounding communities.
