(Reuters) - Departing Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co ( HPE.N ) CEO Meg Whitman will become chief executive of DreamWorks co-founder Jeffrey Katzenberg’s mobile media firm NewTV, a move that places her back into unchartered territory. 
One of the most powerful women in U.S. business and a former candidate for California governor, Whitman will be moving into a nascent sector much like when she took over eBay Inc ( EBAY.O ) in its early stages and turned it into a multi-billion dollar business. 
“Getting Meg was a coup as many companies wanted her,” GBH Insights analyst Daniel Ives said on Wednesday. 
Whitman starts March 1 at Katzenberg’s startup firm, which plans to make Hollywood-style, short-form videos for mobile use. 
”This is a change of pace for Meg after stepping down from HP as NewTV and Katzenberg have created a unique business model which has a long runway ahead of it for the coming years,” Ives said. 
Several media reports said NewTV is trying to raise about $2 billion, which would be a significant first round of financing for a digital media startup. The firm declined to comment on the funding. Katzenberg is chairman of NewTV. 
Whitman, who was reportedly a leading candidate for the chief executive job at ride-hailing firm Uber before it was given to Dara Khosrowshahi, steps down as CEO of Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co ( HPE.N ) on Feb. 1. 
At HPE, she pulled off one of the biggest corporate breakups in history. She spun off Hewlett Packard Co into HPE and PC-and-printer business HP Inc ( HPQ.N ) in 2015, as part of a plan to turn around the corporation. 
Whitman previously served on the board of DreamWorks Animation, which Katzenberg co-founded. Reporting by Munsif Vengattil in Bengaluru; editing by Sai Sachin Ravikumar, Bernard Orr
