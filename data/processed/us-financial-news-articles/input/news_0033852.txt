SAN DIEGO, Jan. 22, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- ResMed Inc. (NYSE: RMD, ASX: RMD) today announced results for its quarter ended December 31, 2017. Revenue for the quarter was $601.3 million, a 13 percent increase compared to the same period of the prior year.
"We had a strong quarter with double-digit revenue and operating profit growth" said Mick Farrell, ResMed's chief executive officer. "Our masks have performed well around the world, device sales are solid, and our cloud-based software continues to grow rapidly. Our operating excellence initiatives are achieving leverage in the business with more runway ahead."
Farrell concluded, "We recently announced our first ResMed branded portable oxygen concentrator, called Mobi, which will launch in the current quarter. Mobi exemplifies patient-centered innovation and our commitment to pioneer products and create value with services and solutions that improve patients' quality of life, reduce the impact of chronic disease and save healthcare costs globally."
Analysis of second quarter results
Second quarter revenue in United States, Canada and Latin America, excluding Brightree, was $329.2 million, a 12 percent increase over the same period of the prior year. Brightree revenue for the second quarter was $38.7 million, an increase of 14 percent compared to the same period of the prior year. Revenue in Europe, Asia and other markets was $233.4 million, an increase of 8 percent on a constant currency basis, compared to the same period of the prior year.
Gross margin in the second quarter was 58.2 percent, lower than the prior year's quarter gross margin of 58.3 percent mainly due to declines in average selling prices, which were partially offset by manufacturing and procurement efficiencies.
Income from operations for the quarter was $146.0 million, a 51 percent increase compared with the quarter ended December 31, 2016. Non-GAAP income from operations for the quarter was $157.3 million, a 20 percent increase compared to the same period of the prior year.
Selling, general and administrative expenses were $151.8 million, a 9 percent increase over the same period in the prior year, or a 6 percent increase on a constant currency basis. SG&A expenses improved to 25.2 percent of revenue in the quarter, compared with 26.3 percent reported in the quarter ended December 31, 2016.
Research and development expenses were $40.6 million, or 6.8 percent of revenue. R&D expenses increased by 6 percent compared with the same period last year, or a 4 percent increase on a constant currency basis.
Amortization of acquired intangible assets was $11.3 million during the quarter, which is consistent with the same period last year. Stock-based compensation costs incurred during the quarter of $12.0 million consisted of expenses associated with employee equity grants and our employee stock purchase plan.
Net income for the quarter was $9.5 million, an 88 percent decrease compared to the same period of the prior year. Non-GAAP net income was $143.8 million, a 39 percent increase compared to the prior year.
Non-GAAP measures adjust for amortization of acquired intangibles, impact of U.S. tax reform on income tax expense, restructuring expenses, litigation settlement expenses, acquisition related expenses and the Astral battery field safety notification expenses.
GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter decreased by 87 percent to $0.07. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.00 were 37 percent higher compared with the same period of the prior year.
Cash flow from operations for the quarter was $132.6 million compared to net income in the current quarter of $9.5 million. During the quarter we paid $49.9 million in dividends.
Impact of U.S. tax reform on income tax expense
On December 22, 2017 "H.R.1", originally known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, was enacted into law ("U.S. tax reform"). ASC 740 Income Taxes requires companies to recognize the effect of any tax laws during the period in which they are enacted. Accordingly, the company performed preliminary calculations and based on these, recognized additional income tax expense of $126.6 million for the three and six months ended December 31, 2017.
The U.S. tax reform significantly revises the U.S. corporate income tax by, among other things, imposing a one-time transition tax on unremitted foreign earnings, lowering the corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent and implementing a territorial tax system in regard to foreign earnings. The one-time transition tax on unremitted foreign earnings results in additional income tax expense of $119.9 million, of which $10.5 million has been recorded as income taxes payable and $109.4 million has been recorded as long-term income taxes payable. The lower corporate tax rate results in a reduction of net deferred tax assets and an increase in income tax expense of $6.7 million.
Share repurchase program
During the quarter, the company repurchased 100,000 shares at a cost of $8.5 million, as part of its ongoing capital management program.
Dividend program
The ResMed board of directors today declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.35 per share. The dividend will have a record date of February 8, 2018, payable on March 15, 2018. The dividend will be paid in U.S. currency to holders of ResMed's common stock trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Holders of Chess Depositary Instruments trading on the Australian Securities Exchange will receive an equivalent amount in Australian currency, based on the exchange rate on the record date, and reflecting the 10:1 ratio between CDIs and NYSE shares. The ex-dividend date will be February 7, 2018 for common stock holders and for CDI holders. ResMed has received a waiver from the ASX's settlement operating rules, which will allow ResMed to defer processing conversions between its common stock and CDI registers from February 7, 2018 through February 8, 2018, inclusive.

ResMed adjusts for the impact of the amortization of acquired intangibles, impact of U.S. tax reform, restructuring expenses, litigation settlement expenses, acquisition related expenses and the Astral battery field safety notification expenses, from their evaluation of ongoing operations and believes investors benefit from adjusting these items to facilitate a more meaningful evaluation of current operating performance.
ResMed believes that non-GAAP diluted earnings per share is an additional measure of performance investors can use to compare operating results between reporting periods. ResMed uses non-GAAP information internally in planning, forecasting, and evaluating the results of operations in the current period and in comparing it to past periods. ResMed believes this information provides investors better insight in evaluating ResMed's performance from core operations and provides consistent financial reporting. Our use of non-GAAP measures is intended to supplement, and not to replace, our presentation of net income and other GAAP measures. Like all non-GAAP measures, non-GAAP earnings are subject to inherent limitations because they do not include all the expenses that must be included under GAAP.
