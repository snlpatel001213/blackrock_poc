RICHMOND, Va., Jan. 29, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Dominion Energy (NYSE: D) today announced unaudited reported earnings determined in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (reported earnings) for the three months ended Dec. 31, 2017, of $1.4 billion ($2.25 per share) compared with earnings of $457 million ($0.73 per share) for the same period in 2016.
Operating earnings for the three months ended Dec. 31, 2017, were $585 million ($0.91 per share), compared to operating earnings of $618 million ($0.99 per share) for the same period in 2016. Operating earnings are defined as reported earnings adjusted for certain items.
The principal difference between reported earnings and operating earnings for the quarter was a tax benefit associated with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted in December 2017.
Dominion Energy uses operating earnings as the primary performance measurement of its earnings guidance and results for public communications with analysts and investors. Dominion Energy also uses operating earnings internally for budgeting, for reporting to the Board of Directors, for the company's incentive compensation plans and for its targeted dividend payouts and other purposes. Dominion Energy management believes operating earnings provide a more meaningful representation of the company's fundamental earnings power.
Thomas F. Farrell II, chairman, president and chief executive officer, said:
"We are very pleased with our record operational and safety performance for the year. In addition, we achieved strong financial results for 2017 and reported operating earnings of $3.60 per share in the middle of our guidance range, despite weather that was significantly below normal.
"Construction of the 1,588-megawatt Greensville County combined cycle power station continues on time and on budget. The project is approximately 73 percent complete and is expected to begin commercial operations in late 2018.
"We recently received a Limited Notice to Proceed from FERC for the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and the Supply Header Project which allows us to remain on schedule for completion of the projects in the second half of 2019.
"Cove Point Liquefaction construction is complete and we are in the final stages of commissioning.
"And finally, in December the Dominion Energy Board of Directors established a 2018 dividend of $3.34 per share, subject to quarterly determination and declaration, that represented a 10 percent year-over-year increase."
Full-year 2017 Reported and Operating Earnings Compared to 2016
Reported earnings in 2017 were $1.0 billion higher than full-year reported earnings in 2016. Business segment results and detailed descriptions of items included in 2017 and 2016 reported earnings but excluded from operating earnings can be found on schedules 1, 2, and 3 of this release.
Operating earnings, in 2017, decreased $58 million as compared to full-year 2016 operating earnings. The decrease is primarily attributable to milder weather in our regulated service territory, a step down in solar investment tax credits, a second Millstone refueling outage and a reduction of Cove Point import contract revenues. Factors offsetting the decrease include growth in our regulated gas and electric businesses, the addition of Dominion Energy Questar and lower operating expenses.
Details of fourth-quarter and full-year 2017 operating earnings as compared to 2016 may be found on Schedule 4 of this release.
Operating Earnings Guidance
Dominion Energy expects 2018 operating earnings in the range of $3.80-$4.25 per share, compared to full-year 2017 operating earnings of $3.60 per share. Positive factors include a return to normal weather in our regulated service territories, one fewer Millstone refueling outage, revenues from Cove Point export contracts, and the benefit of a lower tax rate due to tax reform. The company expects negative factors for the year to include a step down in solar investment tax credits as well as higher financing costs and share dilution.
First-quarter 2018 operating earnings are expected to be in the range of $0.95-$1.15 per share.
In providing its operating earnings guidance, the company notes that there could be differences between expected reported earnings and estimated operating earnings for matters such as, but not limited to, acquisitions, divestitures or changes in accounting principles. At this time, Dominion Energy management is not able to estimate the aggregate impact of these items on future period reported earnings.

Schedule 2 - Reconciliation of 2017 Operating Earnings to Reported Earnings
2017 Earnings (Twelve months ended December 31, 2017)
The $235 million pre-tax net effect of the adjustments included in 2017 reported earnings, but excluded from operating earnings, is primarily related to the following items:
$158 million of impairment charges associated with our equity method investments in wind-powered generation facilities. $72 million of transaction and transition costs, primarily associated with the Dominion Energy Questar combination. $46 million net gain related to our investments in nuclear decommissioning trust funds.
The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, enacted in December 2017, reduced the corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%. Dominion Energy recognized $988 million of tax benefits resulting from the re-measurement of deferred income taxes to the new corporate income tax rate.

* Income taxes for individual pre-tax items include current and deferred taxes using a transactional effective tax rate. For interim reporting purposes, such amounts may be adjusted in connection with the calculation of the Company's year-to-date income tax provision based on its estimated annual effective tax rate.
** The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act reduced the corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, effective 1/1/2018. Deferred taxes are required to be measured at the enacted rate in effect when they are expected to reverse. As a result, deferred taxes were re-measured to the 21% rate. For regulated entities, where the reduction in deferred taxes is expected to be recovered or refunded in future rates, the adjustment was recorded to a regulatory asset or liability instead of income tax expense.
2) YTD EPS may not equal sum of quarters due to share count differences
Schedule 3 - Reconciliation of 2016 Reported Earnings to Operating Earnings
2016 Earnings (Twelve months ended December 31, 2016)
The $359 million pre-tax net effect of the adjustments included in 2016 reported earnings, but excluded from operating earnings, is primarily related to the following items:
$197 million additional charge associated with the asset retirement obligations for ash ponds and landfills at certain utility generation facilities to comply with the EPA coal combustion residuals rule. $74 million of transaction and transition costs associated with the Dominion Energy Questar combination, which was completed in September 2016. $65 million charge associated with an organizational design initiative and primarily comprised of employee severance benefits. $23 million of restoration costs associated with Hurricane Matthew affecting our electric utility service territories.
