Jan 29 (Reuters) - Canada’s main stock index fell shortly after the opening bell on Monday, weighed by a decline in energy and other resource shares as the price of oil tumbled.
At 9:45 a.m. EST (1445 GMT), the Toronto Stock Exchange’s S&P/TSX composite index was down 69.65 points, or 0.43 percent, at 16,169.57. (Reporting by Leah Schnurr)
