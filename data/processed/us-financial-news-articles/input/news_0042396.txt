MORNING CALL: EUROPEAN SHARES SEEN LITTLE CHANGED (0621 GMT) 
Good morning and welcome to Live Markets. European shares are set to open little changed today after Asian shares took a breather, while a fresh burst of speculative selling took the U.S. dollar to three-year lows on the euro. 
Financial spreadbetters expect London’s FTSE to open 9 points lower at 7,722.5, Frankfurt’s DAX to open 2 point higher at 13,561.5 and Paris’ CAC to open 1 point higher at 5,536.3.
