January 17, 2018 / 3:14 PM / in 6 hours Citi sees bitcoin potentially halving in value again   
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Bitcoin may lose 50 percent of its value from its current level as fears over regulatory clamp-downs have spurred a rout among cryptocurrencies this week, Citi analysts said on Wednesday. 
The world’s biggest and best known digital currency, which fell below $10,000 on Wednesday, could fall into a range of $5,605 to $5,673 based on technical factors. This possible move “looks very likely to be very speedy,” the analysts wrote in a research note. Reporting by Richard LeongEditing by Chizu Nomiyama
