SAN FRANCISCO, Jan. AlphaFlow, the first automated alternative investment platform for real estate, announced today that Chris Woida has joined the company as co-Chief Investment Officer. Woida will serve as co-CIO alongside the firm's CEO Ray Sturm, who will act as both CEO and co-CIO.
Following the recent closing of their $4.1 million seed investment round led by Point72 Ventures and Resolute Ventures, AlphaFlow continues to build its team with Woida joining as a key senior appointment to its executive leadership.
"Chris' innovation and leadership in the investment community, particularly in systematic investing, alternatives and data analytics, brings tremendous strategic value to AlphaFlow," said Sturm. "We are excited to have Chris onboard our executive team as the company continues to grow into a premier real estate investment service for investors, RIAs and wealth managers."
Woida brings over 10 years of experience in the financial services industry, previously helping build BlackRock's smart beta and factor-based platforms and serving as the lead investment strategist for its flagship style-factor hedge fund during his seven years with the company. Most recently, he served as Managing Director, Head of Index Solutions at Axioma, a provider of enterprise market risk and portfolio analytics solutions. In this role, Woida helped the index business expand into derivatives, fixed income and alternative data sources, including AI and ESG.
"AlphaFlow is connecting investors and lenders in a truly unique approach by using data and analytics to transform the traditional real estate investing experience," said Woida. "I'm looking forward to working with the AlphaFlow team and building on the firm's successes as a leader in alternative investments."
Woida joins a growing AlphaFlow management team, which added Miles Deamer as Director of Investments over the past year.
