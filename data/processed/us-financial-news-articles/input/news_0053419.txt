WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States is confident that the Afghan Taliban-allied Haqqani network was behind Saturday’s ambulance bomb in the capital, Kabul, that killed more than 100 people, a spokesman for the U.S.-led coalition told Reuters on Monday.
“We are very confident the Taliban Haqqani network was behind the killing of more than 103 people this past Saturday,” said Captain Tom Gresback, a U.S. military spokesman for the NATO-led Resolute Support mission in Afghanistan.
Another U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, also said the United States believed the attack was the work of the Haqqani network, which Washington has long said has safe haven in neighbouring Pakistan.
