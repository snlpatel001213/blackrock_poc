United States: Citi Fined for Failing to Fix Money-Laundering Controls January 5th, 2018 Americas 
A U.S. regulator said Thursday that Citigroup Inc. C 1.23% hasn’t lived up to its promises to beef up anti-money-laundering procedures. 
The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency said Citigroup’s deposit-taking bank, Citibank N.A., hasn’t adhered to a 2012 order that accused it of failing to fully comply with the Bank Secrecy Act. This requires financial firms to report suspicious activities and take other measures to prevent potential money laundering. 
Thursday’s regulatory action suggested to some lawyers that the administration of President Donald Trump, despite promises to loosen bank regulation, is drawing distinctions.
