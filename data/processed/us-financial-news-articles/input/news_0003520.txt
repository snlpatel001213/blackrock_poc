The 21-year-old will travel to England next week for a medical with a view of completing a permanent move to Elland Road. 
“As the J1 League ended in early December, it is likely that Leeds United will loan Ideguchi out to Cultural Leonesa until the end of the season should the player pass his medical,” Leeds said in a statement. 
Ideguchi made his debut for Japan in Nov. 2016 and has scored twice in 10 caps. Reporting by Hardik Vyas
