BERLIN (Reuters) - Third-placed Borussia Dortmund were held 1-1 at Hertha Berlin in the Bundesliga on Friday for their second draw in a row without leading striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang. 
The Gabon international, with 13 league goals this season, was suspended for last week’s 0-0 draw with VfL Wolfsburg after failing to show up for a team meeting the day before. 
Dortmund coach Peter Stoeger on Thursday indicated the 28-year-old would be in the squad but the forward was surprisingly left out with club officials saying he was not focussed enough.

His absence was again clearly evident as Dortmund had few chances in a subdued first half before Davie Selke put Hertha ahead seconds after the restart.

The visitors could have snatched a late winner but Sancho curled his shot wide and Alexander Isak fired against the bar.
