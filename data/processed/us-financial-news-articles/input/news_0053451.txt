RICHMOND, Va., Jan. 29, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Dominion Energy Midstream Partners, LP (NYSE: DM), reported unaudited net income attributable to the partnership of $52.3 million for the three months ended Dec. 31, 2017 and $195.1 million for the twelve months ended Dec. 31, 2017, nearly double 2016. Adjusted earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization (Adjusted EBITDA) were $78.6 million for the fourth-quarter and $298.8 million for full-year 2017, almost two and a half times 2016. Distributable cash flow was $47.6 million for the quarter and $178.2 million for the year, representing a 68 percent increase over 2016. The distribution coverage ratio was 1.22 times at the end of the fourth-quarter with the full-year coverage ratio of 1.29 times.
Dominion Energy Midstream uses Adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow as the primary performance measurements of its earnings and results for public communications with analysts and investors. Dominion Energy Midstream also uses Adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow internally for budgeting, reporting to the Board of Directors and other purposes. Management believes Adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow provide a more meaningful representation of the partnership's financial performance and liquidity. Schedules B and D of this press release include reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.

On Jan. 25, 2018, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly distribution of $0.3180 per common and subordinated unit, payable on Feb. 15, 2018, to such unitholders of record at the close of business Feb. 5, 2018.
