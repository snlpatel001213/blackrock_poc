On November 13, 2017, WesBanco and First Sentry Bancshares, Inc. ("FTSB"), a bank holding company headquartered in Huntington, WV with approximately $670 million in assets, jointly announced that a definitive Agreement and Plan of Merger was executed providing for the merger of FTSB with and into WesBanco. The transaction, valued at approximately $101.4 million, is expected to close during the first half of 2018.
Financial and operational highlights:
Loan growth over the last twelve months was driven by our strategic focus categories 4.0% growth in total commercial loans 4.1% growth in home equity loans Continued benefit from shale energy-related core funding as demonstrated by strong year-over-year growth in total demand deposits Continued strength across credit quality metrics Solid expense management demonstrated by non-interest expenses, excluding merger-related, decreasing both sequentially and year-over-year Fourth quarter efficiency ratio improved to 55.08% (non-GAAP measure) Strong fourth quarter profitability ratios with return on average assets of 1.16% and return on average tangible equity of 14.36%, excluding net deferred tax asset revaluation and merger-related expenses Merger with First Sentry Bancshares continues to progress well and remains on schedule
"WesBanco had another successful year during 2017 as we reported record earnings â€“ surpassing $107 million for the year, adjusting for the net deferred tax asset revaluation," said Todd F. Clossin, President and Chief Executive Officer of WesBanco. "We are executing upon the well-defined, long-term operational and growth plans we have implemented over the last few years. We have balanced loan and deposit distribution across our diverse regional footprint, as well as strong market positions. We remain focused on the long-term success of our diversified business model, and we diligently manage discretionary expenses to deliver positive operating leverage. We are strengthening our loan portfolio, and see opportunities for expanded wealth management revenues. This strategic focus, coupled with our strong risk and compliance framework, helped us to be named one of America's Top 20 Best Banks for 2018 by a leading financial magazine."
Mr. Clossin added, "our proposed merger with First Sentry Bancshares is progressing well, and we anticipate the closing to occur sometime during the first half of 2018. We are well-prepared and strategically positioned for crossing the $10 billion asset threshold and the associated regulatory requirements. We are excited about our opportunities for the upcoming year, and look forward to providing additional value to our customers and shareholders."
Balance Sheet
Portfolio loans of $6.3 billion increased 1.5% over the last twelve months, reflecting growth in our strategic focus categories. Total commercial loans grew 4.0% and home equity loans grew 4.1% over the past twelve months, which more than offset targeted reductions in the consumer portfolio to reduce its risk profile. In addition, secondary market loan sales in the residential real estate portfolio continued to increase, which reduced the amount of loans held on the balance sheet. Total deposits, excluding CDs, increased 4.0%, driven by 4.1% growth in interest bearing and non-interest bearing demand deposits, which now represent 49.3% of total deposits as of December 31, 2017.
Credit Quality
The continued strength of our credit quality ratios is reflective of our strong legacy of credit and risk management. As of December 31, 2017, both non-performing assets as a percentage of total assets of 0.50% and non-performing loans as a percentage of total portfolio loans of 0.68% remained consistent with the recent trends. Criticized and classified loans were 1.17% of total loans, improving both sequentially and year-over-year. Net charge-offs as a percentage of average portfolio loans were 0.16% in the fourth quarter of 2017, as compared to 0.08% in the fourth quarter of 2016, and on an annualized basis net charge-offs were 0.13% for 2017, compared to 0.12% in 2016.
The provision for credit losses increased slightly from $2.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 to $2.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 due primarily to loan growth. The allowance for loan losses of $45.3 million represented 0.71% of total portfolio loans at December 31, 2017, compared to 0.70% in the year ago period.
Net Interest Margin and Income
The net interest margin during the fourth quarter of 2017 was 3.43%, up 1 basis point from the prior year period. The net interest margin continues to benefit from increases in the Federal Reserve Board's target federal funds rate over the past year and a higher margin on the acquired YCB net assets, partially offset by higher funding costs as well as a flattening of the yield curve. The increase in the cost of interest bearing liabilities is primarily due to higher rates for interest bearing demand deposits, which include public funds, and certain Federal Home Loan Bank and other borrowings. Accretion from prior acquisitions benefited the fourth quarter net interest margin by approximately 6 basis points, as compared to 10 basis points in the prior year period; however, was down 5 basis points from the third quarter, which had included an approximate $1.1 million benefit from the pay-off of an acquired YCB loan with a specific loan mark assigned.
Net interest income increased $1.5 million, or 2.1%, during the fourth quarter of 2017 as compared to the same quarter of 2016 due to a similar percentage increase in average loan balances. For the twelve months ending December 31, 2017, net interest income increased $37.0 million, or 14.6%, as average loan balances increased 15.3%, primarily due to the YCB acquisition, and the net interest margin increased 12 basis points to 3.44%.
Non-Interest Income
For the fourth quarter of 2017, non-interest income of $22.9 million increased $1.5 million, or 7.1%, from the fourth quarter of 2016 driven by higher mortgage banking income and higher electronic banking fees. We continued to sell a higher percentage of residential mortgage originations in the secondary market and increased the margin on sold loans, which increased mortgage banking income by $1.1 million year-over-year to $1.5 million. Reflecting a larger average customer deposit base year-over-year from the addition of YCB, electronic banking fees increased $0.5 million, or 12.2%. Other income decreased $0.5 million due to decreases in other fee income more than offsetting a $0.3 million increase in commercial customer loan swap income.
For the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, non-interest income increased $7.3 million, or 9.0%. Reflecting our strategic focus during the last twelve months, mortgage banking income grew from increased secondary market sales of residential mortgage originations; electronic banking fees and service charges on deposits increased as a result of a larger customer deposit base; and trust fees and assets increased reflecting organic growth and improvements in equity markets.
Non-Interest Expense
Total operating expenses continue to be well-controlled during the fourth quarter of 2017, as most categories decreased both year-over-year and sequentially as post-YCB cost savings were achieved and through strong discretionary expense control. Excluding merger-related expenses in both years, non-interest expense during the fourth quarter of 2017 decreased $1.4 million, or 2.5%, versus the third quarter, and $1.2 million, or 2.2%, compared to the prior year period. The decrease from the prior year quarter is primarily due to lower other operating expenses resulting from cost control across supplies, travel and entertainment, and telecommunications, as well as low-income housing amortization expense being moved to tax expense during 2017. Salaries and wages increased $1.6 million, or 6.8%, year-over-year due to higher average staff levels from the YCB acquisition and the impact of the annual merit adjustments to compensation, as well as higher incentive accruals, partially offset by a $1.0 million reduction in employee benefits from lower medical benefit costs and lower pension expense.
Excluding merger-related expenses in both years, non-interest expense during 2017 increased $24.5 million, or 12.5%, compared to 2016 reflecting a full year impact of the YCB acquisition and continued preparations for the $10 billion asset threshold, partially offset by cost savings initiatives.
Provision for Income Taxes
The provision for income taxes for the fourth quarter of 2017 increased $14.5 million to $23.0 million compared to the prior year due to a $12.8 million impact from the revaluation of net deferred tax assets during the quarter resulting from the recently enacted Federal tax reform legislation, as announced by WesBanco on December 29, 2017.
For the twelve months of 2017, the provision for income taxes increased $22.8 million, or 73.4%, compared to the same period in 2016. This increase is due to a $12.8 million impact from the revaluation of net deferred tax assets mentioned above; a 26.0% increase in pre-tax income; and the adoption earlier this year of a new accounting standard related to low income housing tax credit investment amortization, which moved $1.2 million from other operating expense to the provision for income taxes.
Capital
WesBanco continues to maintain strong regulatory capital ratios after the implementation of the BASEL III capital standards. At December 31, 2017, Tier I leverage was 10.33%, Tier I Risk-Based capital was 14.03%, Total Risk-Based capital was 15.07%, and the Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio ("CET 1") was 12.05%. Both consolidated and bank-level regulatory capital ratios are well above the applicable "well-capitalized" standards promulgated by bank regulators and the BASEL III capital standards. Total tangible equity to tangible assets (non-GAAP measure) was 8.79% at December 31, 2017, increasing from 8.20% at December 31, 2016, which primarily reflects growth in retained earnings, net of dividends paid. Strong earnings and increased total capital have enabled WesBanco to increase the quarterly dividend rate, currently at $0.26 per share, ten times over the last seven years, a cumulative increase of 86%. The most recent increase was $0.02 per share per quarter during the first quarter of 2017, which represents an annualized increase of 8.3%.

(1) See non-GAAP financial measures for additional information relating to the calculation of this item.
(2) The yield on earning assets, net interest margin, net interest spread and efficiency ratios are presented on a fully
taxable-equivalent (FTE) and annualized basis. The FTE basis adjusts for the tax benefit of income on certain tax-exempt
loans and investments. WesBanco believes this measure to be the preferred industry measurement of net interest income and
provides a relevant comparison between taxable and non-taxable amounts.
(3) The three months ended December 31, 2017 and the year ended December 31, 2017 include a $12.8 million tax expense as a result of the net deferred tax asset revaluation.
