BUCHAREST, Jan 16 (Reuters) - Romania’s ruling Social Democrats (PSD) proposed European MP Viorica Dancila for new prime minister on Tuesday after a unanimous vote by the party’s leadership, party officials said.
PSD member Dancila, 54, is a close ally of powerful PSD leader Liviu Dragnea and is a vice-chair of the European parliament’s Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.
“We voted unanimously for her. This candidacy we propose cannot be refused by the president, we wanted a person with European exposure,” a PSD leader told Reuters by telephone.
