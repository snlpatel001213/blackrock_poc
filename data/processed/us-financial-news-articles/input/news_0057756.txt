Victor Rask scored on a third-period power play, lifting the Carolina Hurricanes to a 2-1 win over the Ottawa Senators on Tuesday night as the teams began the post-All-Star break schedule at PNC Arena in Raleigh, N.C.
Sebastian Aho tied the game earlier in the final period as Carolina began an eight-game homestand.
Jean-Gabriel Pageau scored in the second period for the Senators, who lost their sixth consecutive game.
Hurricanes goalie Cam Ward stopped 29 shots.
Senators goalie Craig Anderson made 37 saves, including stopping all 18 shots in a busy second period.
Justin Williams and Noah Hanifin assisted on the winning goal, which came with 8:28 remaining. Hanifin, a defenseman coming off his first All-Star Game appearance, drew the penalty that led to the power play.
Rask, a center, has 12 goals this season.
Carolina improved to 2-13-4 when trailing after two periods this season.
The Hurricanes posted their first home victory in January after going 0-3-1 to in Raleigh to start the month.
Pageau’s seventh goal of the season broke a scoreless tie with 1:12 to play in the second period. His shot made it through traffic on the way to the net.
Rask had a prime scoring chance in the waning seconds of the second period but was denied by Anderson.
Aho’s tying goal came on a blast at 1:49 of the third. He was set up by Teuvo Teravainen.
Aho was playing for the first time after a four-game absence because of a concussion and knee injury. He benefitted during that stretch from the team’s bye week and then later the All-Star break.
The first period was scoreless as both teams struggled to display much timing, combining for 18 shots.
The Hurricanes, who came under new ownership earlier this month, invited all fans to the lower level in an effort to make the arena a more intimate atmosphere. The fans had to wait for the tying and winning goals, but they were treated with the desired result.
