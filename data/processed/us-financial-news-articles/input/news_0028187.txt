Scientific research shows that being stressed out at work can take a serious toll on your physical and mental health.
In an effort to help people find happiness in the workplace, career and recruiting website CareerBliss recently released its eighth annual list of the 50 happiest companies in America. The distinction recognizes the U.S. companies which are succeeding in building a happier culture and positive work environment for their employees.
The list includes well-known companies including American Express, Apple, Microsoft and Nike, as well as other large and mid-size companies. 
For this year's happiest companies list, CareerBliss analyzed data from more than 41,000 independent employee reviews. The CareerBliss board of workplace PhD advisors, which include experts in organizational behavior, psychology and computer science, determined 10 key factors that determine workplace happiness: company culture, growth opportunities, people you work with, person you work for, rewards you receive, support you get, the way you work, work setting, CEO rating and overall company rating. 
Reviews are then quantified into what the website calls a "BlissScore" with five being the most positive score and one being the least positive.
"Our data shows that happiness can impact productivity, employee loyalty and overall employee success," CareerBliss CEO Heidi Golledge told CNBC Make It in a statement. "Happiness at work should be one of the first factors we account for when thinking about who we want to work for and how we want to work."
Golledge adds that happiness is a metric which can be used to help employers and employees alike determine the best company for their individual needs.

"It is not necessarily a well-known tech company like Google or Amazon that provides the happiest work environment. Companies need to be able to meet employees' needs across a variety of factors," CareerBliss adviser and University of Tulsa psychology professor Bradley Brummel, PhD, said in a statement.
"We find that employees who have a good relationship with their manager and a positive perception of their CEO are more likely to remain happier at their job and stay with the company longer," he added.
