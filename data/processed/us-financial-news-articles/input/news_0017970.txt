BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany will remain focused on preserving a united stance between the European Union’s 27 members in talks with London on Brexit, a government spokesman said on Wednesday after British ministers made a direct appeal to Berlin to cut it a good deal.
“We have always stressed the importance of the unity of the EU 27 ...this will continue to be our focus,” Steffen Seibert told reporters when asked about a joint article by Britain’s finance and Brexit ministers in a German newspaper.
