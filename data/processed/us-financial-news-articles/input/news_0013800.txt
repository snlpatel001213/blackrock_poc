Jan 17 (Reuters) - Tiffany & Co said on Wednesday its same-store sales in the Americas rose 6 percent in the holiday period, helping the upscale jeweler raise its full-year earnings forecast. 
The increase in same-store sales was due to higher demand for high-end jewelry, watches and accessories, the company said. 
Tiffany now expects earnings to rise in high-single digit percentage range for its fiscal year ending Jan. 31, from its prior forecast of mid-single digit rise. 
Tiffany also said global same-store sales rose 5 percent, while overall sales rose 8 percent for the two months ending Dec 31. Reporting by Siddharth Cavale and Karina Dsouza in Bengaluru; Editing by Arun Koyyur
