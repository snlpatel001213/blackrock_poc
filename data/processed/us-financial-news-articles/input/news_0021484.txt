Citigroup Inc. today reported a net loss for the fourth quarter 2017 of $18.3 billion, or $7.15 per diluted share, on revenues of $17.3 billion. This compared to net income of $3.6 billion, or $1.14 per diluted share, on revenues of $17.0 billion for the fourth quarter 2016.
The net loss of $18.3 billion, or $7.15 per share, included an estimated one-time, non-cash charge of $22 billion, or $8.43 per share, recorded in the tax line within Corporate / Other, related to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Reform) 7 . This charge is comprised of $19 billion related to the re-measurement of Citi’s deferred tax assets (DTA) arising from a lower U.S. corporate tax rate and shift to a territorial tax regime, and $3 billion related to the deemed repatriation of unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries. Excluding the impact of Tax Reform, net income of $3.7 billion increased 4% from the prior year period. Earnings per share increased 12% to $1.28, driven by the higher net income and a 7% reduction in average diluted shares outstanding. These results include a combined net benefit of roughly $0.08 per share, recorded in Corporate / Other, related to discrete items that resulted in a lower-than-expected tax rate, as well as a one-time loss in discontinued operations.
Citi CEO Michael Corbat said, “While our fourth quarter results reflected the impact of a significant non-cash charge due to tax reform, the impact on our regulatory capital was much less significant. Tax reform does not change our capital return goals as we remain committed to returning at least $60 billion of capital in the current and next two CCAR cycles, subject to regulatory approval. Tax reform not only leads to higher net income and increased returns, but also serves to strengthen our capital generation capabilities going forward.
“We closed this important year with strong operating earnings of $3.7 billion in the fourth quarter, or $1.28 per share. We grew loans across both our Consumer and Institutional franchises and we continue to see good progress across those products and geographies where we have been investing.
“On an operating basis for the full year, we earned $15.8 billion in net income, which was nearly $1 billion more than 2016. And our earnings per share were $5.33, up 13% from 2016. We also made solid progress towards the targets we introduced during Investor Day in July. Revenue growth and strong expense management brought us to a full year Efficiency Ratio of 57.7%, an improvement of over 150 basis points from 2016. And our Return on Tangible Common Equity including and excluding DTA increased to 8.1% and 9.6%, respectively,” Mr. Corbat concluded.
For the full year 2017, Citigroup reported a net loss of $6.2 billion on revenues of $71.4 billion, compared to net income of $14.9 billion on revenues of $69.9 billion for the full year 2016. Excluding the impact of Tax Reform, Citigroup net income of $15.8 billion increased 6% compared to the prior year.
Throughout the remainder of this press release, Citigroup and Corporate / Other’s net income and Citigroup’s effective tax rate are presented on a reported and adjusted basis, excluding the impact of Tax Reform. For additional information on this adjustment as well as other non-GAAP financial measures used in this release, see the Appendices and Footnotes to this release. Percentage comparisons are calculated for the fourth quarter 2017 versus the fourth quarter 2016, unless otherwise specified.

Citigroup revenues of $17.3 billion in the fourth quarter 2017 increased 1%, driven by 2% aggregate growth in Global Consumer Banking (GCB) and Institutional Clients Group (ICG), partially offset by a 13% decrease in Corporate / Other, primarily due to the continued wind-down of legacy assets.
Citigroup’s operating expenses remained largely unchanged at $10.1 billion in the fourth quarter 2017, as higher volume-related expenses and ongoing investments were offset by efficiency savings and the wind-down of legacy assets.
Citigroup’s cost of credit in the fourth quarter 2017 was $2.1 billion, a 16% increase, driven by an increase in net credit losses of $184 million, primarily due to
