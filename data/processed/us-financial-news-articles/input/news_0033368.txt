NEW YORK, Jan. 22, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Attorney Advertising -- Bronstein, Gewirtz & Grossman, LLC notifies investors that a class action lawsuit has been filed against Aerohive Networks, Inc. ("Aerohive " or the "Company") (NYSE: HIVE) and certain of its officers, on behalf of shareholders who purchased Aerohive securities during the period between November 1, 2017 and January 16, 2018, both dates inclusive (the "Class Period"). Such investors are encouraged to join this case by visiting the firm's site: http://www.bgandg.com/hive .
This class action seeks to recover damages against Defendants for alleged violations of the federal securities laws under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
The complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) there were underlying sales execution issues that were uncovered at the end of the third quarter of 2017; (2) consequently, Aerohive's revenue guidance for the fourth quarter of 2017 was overstated; and (3) as a result, defendants' public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times.
On November 1, 2017, Aerohive held its third quarter 2017 conference call, when CFO, John Ritchie, said that "[w]e are currently expecting Q4 revenue in the range of $40 million to $42 million," and that "[w]e realized significant sales efficiency with our non-GAAP sales and marketing costs." Then, on January 16, 2018, Aerohive revealed that it "expects net revenue for the fourth quarter to be approximately $37 million, which is below the Company's previously stated guidance of $40 million to $42 million." Aerohive noted that the reduced guidance to was due to "underlying sales execution issues" revealed at the end of its third quarter. Following this news, Aerohive stock dropped $1.63 per share or over 29% to close at $4.07 per share on January 17, 2018.
