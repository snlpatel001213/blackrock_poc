HOUSTON, Jan. 09, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Apache Corporation (NYSE:APA) (Nasdaq:APA) today provided an update to its fourth-quarter 2017 production outlook and certain other items.
Internationally, the company revised its production outlook to reflect the impact of unscheduled downtime at the third-party operated Forties Pipeline System and the underperformance of recent wells in the Beryl area of the North Sea. Adjusted sales volumes were also lower in Egypt, primarily due to the impact of improving Brent oil prices on the cost recovery mechanisms in Apache’s production sharing contracts. As a result of these factors, the company expects fourth-quarter adjusted international production in the range of 138,000 to 140,000 barrels of oil equivalent (BOE) per day and base-level production volumes to be lower than planned going into 2018.
In the United States, fourth-quarter production is expected to be at the high end of the company’s guidance range of 218,000 to 224,000 per day BOE, driven primarily by strong quarter-over-quarter growth in the Permian Basin.
John J. Christmann IV, Apache's chief executive officer and president, said, “Robust Brent crude prices enabled our international operations to generate strong free cash flow during the fourth quarter despite the reduction in production volumes. In the Permian, we delivered our second quarter in a row of strong oil production growth; and, at Alpine High, we achieved our production target of more than 25,000 BOE per day by the end of December.”
To further assist analysts with their fourth-quarter production and earnings models, the company is also providing the following estimates:
Realized loss on oil and gas price derivatives (before tax): $49 million
Dry hole costs (before tax): $45 - $50 million
Egypt tax barrels: 32,000 to 36,000 BOE per day
