WASHINGTON—A firestorm ignited by President Donald Trump’s remarks last week has imperiled lawmakers’ ability to reach a deal on immigration and spending levels, according to congressional aides, as a possible government shutdown looms at week’s end. 
Congressional aides say they are expecting a short-term deal funding the government for a few weeks to come to the table, but caution that is by no means guaranteed. Some said prospects for any deal had diminished because of controversial reported comments last week from President Trump in a meeting with lawmakers about his desire to stop immigration from “shithole countries.” 
“Trump’s latest self-created outrage du jour makes it harder for us to get Democrats on board for anything,” said Doug Heye, a former top Republican congressional aide. “It’s not issue specific, it’s not just limited to immigration. That’s the challenge when we have these outbursts.” 
GOP and Democratic leaders had engaged with the White House last week on a deal on federal spending that would bring Democratic support to prevent a government shutdown and include protections for young people, known as Dreamers, who were brought illegally to the U.S. as children. It also could include enhanced border security measures, a White House priority. Absent a spending bill, the federal government would shut nonemergency functions starting Saturday at 12:01 a.m.
