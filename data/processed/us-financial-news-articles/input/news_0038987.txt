“ShiftPixy remains an early stage company, and we will continue to invest in the business as appropriate, in areas such as product development, sales and marketing and client support,” noted Scott W. Absher, Chief Executive Officer of ShiftPixy. “Over the past year, we’ve also incurred the necessary professional expenses related to being a publicly-traded company.”
Mr. Absher continued, “We are pleased with our pattern of growth and the development of our technology platform. We anticipate that the continued development of our technology platform will further enhance our service offerings and better enable us to meet the needs of our assigned workforce and clients as we endeavor to create value for our shareholders.”
2018 Second Quarter Guidance
Based on our preliminary development of financial statements for the second quarter ending February 28, 2018, the Company currently expects gross billings for fiscal second quarter 2018 to be in the range of $60 million to $65 million, which at the midpoint would represent a sequential increase of 55.6% over the fiscal first quarter 2018. Our expectations may change as we continue development of our financial statements for the quarter.
