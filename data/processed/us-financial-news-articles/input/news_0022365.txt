WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Republican Senator Lindsey Graham said on Wednesday he would not vote for a Republican “continuing resolution” stopgap bill to fund the government temporarily and avert a partial shutdown this week, a Politico reporter said on Twitter. 
“I’m not gonna vote for a CR,” Graham, a backer of the bipartisan Senate immigration deal President Donald Trump rejected last week, was quoted as saying. Republicans who control Congress were working on a stopgap bill to fund the government through Feb. 16. Reporting by Makini Brice; Writing by Doina Chiacu; Editing by Jonathan Oatis
