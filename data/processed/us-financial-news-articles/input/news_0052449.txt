* Futures up: Dow 90 pts, S&P 9 pts, Nasdaq 20.75 pts
Jan 31 (Reuters) - U.S. stock index futures rose on Wednesday, after two days of steep losses, boosted by a controversy-free State of Union speech by President Donald Trump, with investors turning their focus back to quarterly earnings and monetary policy.
The blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average suffered its biggest two-day drop since September 2016 over Monday and Tuesday as U.S. Treasury yields surged to near four-year highs on expectations of global central banks lowering stimulus.
The pace of the increase in yields, rather than the rise itself, has hurt stock markets. A rise in yields raises borrowing costs and give traders an alternative investment option.
The Federal Reserve's two-day meeting ends on Wednesday and its statement at 2 p.m. ET (1900 GMT) could shed light on the central bank's economic and interest rate hike outlook. Currently, three rate hikes for the year are priced in.
While analysts do not expect a rate hike, they expect the Fed to strike a more hawkish tone at the meeting, Fed Chair Janet Yellen's last.
At 7:04 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis were up 90 points, or 0.35 percent, with 41,952 contracts changing hands.

Nasdaq 100 e-minis were up 20.75 points, or 0.3 percent, on volume of 42,024 contracts.
U.S. stock index futures drifted higher late on Tuesday as Trump gave his State of the Union address.
Among other comments, Trump said he wanted legislation to generate at least $1.5 trillion for infrastructure spending and revisited a campaign promise to lower drug prices.
