The American is having a dream debut at the Australian Open, ousting high-ranking seeds Stan Wawrinka and Dominic Thiem to progress to the last eight in just his third grand slam event. 
The 26-year-old, who had failed to win a match in his two previous main draw appearances at majors, became the second debutant to reach the quarter-finals at Melbourne Park in 20 years but must battle past fellow giant-slayer Chung Hyeon to keep his dream run going. CHUNG HYEON

In seven previous appearances at majors, Chung has suffered exits in the first three rounds but the Korean became the country’s first player to reach a grand slam quarter-final and is now a favourite to progress further against Sandgren.
