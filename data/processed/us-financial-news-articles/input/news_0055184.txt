LONDON (Reuters) - U.S. hedge fund Elliott, which often wages activist campaigns at companies, has lifted its stake in British pay-television broadcaster Sky SKYB.l to 1.29 percent, a stock exchange filing issued on Monday shows.
It comes as Twenty-First Century Fox attempts to acquire Sky for 11.7 billion-pounds. Elliott first disclosed a 1.09 percent stake in Sky through derivatives on Friday.
