(1) The tax impact of adjustments is calculated based on the income tax rate in each applicable jurisdiction, subject to deductibility limitations and the company's ability to realize the associated tax benefits.
(2) U.S. tax legislation reflects 2017 impact of the benefit of re-measurement of deferred taxes, partially offset by one-time deemed repatriation tax.
The company updated its 2018 sales and earnings per share guidance issued on Nov. 10, 2017, to reflect U.S. tax legislation and 2017 actual results. The company still expects 3 to 7 percent sales growth and now expects earnings per share of $12.95 to $14.15 for 2018. The prior earnings per share guidance for 2018 was $10.60 to $11.80. The increase in the midpoint of the earnings per share guidance is composed of $0.50 from better than expected 2017 operating performance, $2.15 from a lower corporate tax rate under U.S. tax legislation and $0.06 from incremental share buybacks funded by the benefits of the tax legislation, partially offset by $0.10 of lower benefits from clean energy investments and $0.26 in increased investment in the business funded by the benefits of the tax legislation.
For the full year, the company generated $1.1 billion in operating cash flow versus $1.0 billion in 2016. Gross capital expenditures for the year were $237 million versus $284 million in 2016. Grainger repurchased approximately 3.0 million shares of stock for $605 million in 2017, and dividends paid in 2017 totaled $304 million. For the year, Grainger returned $910 million to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends.

In the United States, restructuring charges related to branch closures and severance. Restructuring in Canada related to turnaround costs, which include branch closures. Discrete tax items included the release of tax reserves related to the expiration of statute of limitation periods, items related to uncertain tax positions or benefits and other items. The Other Businesses recorded restructuring charges related to Fabory and Latin America. In total there were $0.31 per share of charges net of tax benefits in the 2017 quarter versus $1.44 per share in the 2016 quarter.
Company
Company sales in the 2017 fourth quarter were up 7 percent versus the prior year. There were 63 selling days in both the 2017 fourth quarter and the 2016 fourth quarter. The sales increase consisted of an 11 percentage point increase from volume, partially offset by a 3 percentage point decline from price and a 1 percentage point decline from the divestiture of a specialty business.
Company operating earnings of $240 million for the 2017 fourth quarter increased 38 percent versus the 2016 quarter. The increase was driven by higher sales and gross profit dollars along with lower restructuring costs and other charges versus the prior year. The company's gross profit margin for the quarter decreased 1.3 percentage points, primarily driven by price deflation in the United States, partially offset by higher gross profit margin in Canada. Operating expenses decreased 4 percent. Excluding restructuring items noted in the fourth quarter table, adjusted operating expenses were up 4 percent and adjusted operating earnings in the quarter were up 4 percent.
The company has two reportable business segments, the United States and Canada, which represented approximately 79 percent of company sales for the quarter. The remaining operating businesses are located in Europe, Asia and Latin America. The single channel online businesses are included in Other Businesses and are not reportable segments.
United States
Sales in the U.S. segment were up 5 percent versus the prior year. The sales increase consisted of a volume increase of 11 percentage points, partially offset by 5 percentage points from price and a 1 percentage point decline from the divestiture of a specialty business. Resellers and Heavy Manufacturing end markets had the strongest sales performance in the quarter.
U.S. segment operating earnings increased 16 percent versus the 2016 quarter. The increase was driven by higher sales and lower restructuring charges. The segment's gross profit margin for the quarter decreased 1.8 percentage points driven by price deflation. Operating expenses decreased 6 percent due to lower restructuring charges. Excluding restructuring items, adjusted operating expenses were up 2 percent and adjusted operating earnings in the quarter were down 1 percent.
Canada
Sales in the Canada segment were up 5 percent in U.S. dollars versus the prior year. The sales increase consisted of 5 percentage points from favorable foreign exchange and a 4 percentage point increase from price, partially offset by a 4 percentage point decrease from volume. Sales to Oil and Gas and Agriculture/Mining customer end markets had the strongest performance in the quarter.
The Canada segment operating loss was $17 million versus a $10 million loss in the 2016 quarter, driven by higher operating expenses. The segment's gross profit margin increased 1.4 percentage points, primarily due to price increases taken in the fourth quarter. Operating expenses increased 18 percent in the quarter due to restructuring charges. Excluding restructuring items, adjusted operating expenses were up 7 percent, up 2 percent in local currency, and adjusted operating earnings in the quarter were up 59 percent.
Other Businesses
Sales for the Other Businesses were up 16 percent versus the prior year, composed of volume and price. Sales growth in the Other Businesses was primarily driven by MonotaRO in Japan and Zoro in the United States.
The Other Businesses operating earnings were $11 million versus $36 million of operating losses in the 2016 fourth quarter. The increase was driven by impairment charges in 2016 for Fabory and Colombia. Excluding restructuring items, adjusted operating expenses were up 13 percent and adjusted operating earnings were up 51 percent.
Other
Other income and expense was a net expense of $32 million in the 2017 fourth quarter versus a net expense of $29 million in the 2016 fourth quarter. This increase was primarily due to additional interest expense from the $400 million of debt issued in May 2017 and higher losses from the company's clean energy investments.
The effective tax rate in 2017 was 22.0 percent for the quarter and 33.5 percent for the full year, compared to 53.0 percent for the 2016 quarter and 37.9 percent for full year 2016. The lower rate in the fourth quarter was primarily due to the comparison to the prior year's non-tax deductibility of a goodwill impairment, discrete tax items from prior years and the tax benefit from stock-based awards. The lower rate in 2017 was driven by the tax benefit from stock-based awards, higher clean energy credits and U.S. tax legislation. The company's clean energy investments generated $0.24 per share of earnings for the year. As a result of U.S. tax legislation signed into law on Dec. 22, 2017, the company is currently projecting a tax rate of 23.0 to 26.0 percent for 2018, versus its prior projection of 34.5 to 35.5 percent on Nov. 10, 2017.
Cash Flow
Operating cash flow was $336 million in the 2017 fourth quarter versus $335 million in the 2016 fourth quarter. The company used the cash generated during the quarter to invest in the business, pay down debt and return cash to shareholders through share repurchase and dividends. Capital expenditures were $46 million in the 2017 fourth quarter versus $71 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. In the 2017 fourth quarter, Grainger returned $248 million to shareholders through $79 million in dividends and $169 million to buy back 855,000 shares of stock. Free cash flow for the quarter was $299 million versus $271 million in the 2016 quarter.

*The GAAP financial statements are the source for all amounts used in the Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) calculation. ROIC is calculated using operating earnings divided by net working assets (a 5-point average for the year). Net working assets are working assets minus working liabilities defined as follows: working assets equal total assets less cash equivalents (5-point average of $84.2 million), deferred taxes, and investments in unconsolidated entities, plus the LIFO reserve (5-point average of $381.7 million). Working liabilities are the sum of trade payables, accrued compensation and benefits, accrued contributions to employees' profit sharing plans, and accrued expenses.

SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION - CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS
RECONCILIATION OF GAAP TO NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES (Unaudited)
(In thousands of dollars)
The company supplemented the reporting of financial information determined under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) with certain non-GAAP financial measures, which the company refers to as "adjusted" measures, including adjusted operating earnings, adjusted segment operating earnings, adjusted net earnings and adjusted diluted earnings per share. Adjusted measures exclude items that may not be indicative of core operating results. The company believes that these non-GAAP measures provide meaningful information to assist shareholders in understanding financial results and assessing prospects for future performance. Management believes adjusted operating earnings, adjusted net earnings and adjusted diluted earnings per share are important indicators of operations because they exclude items that may not be indicative of our core operating results, and provide a better baseline for analyzing trends in our underlying businesses. Because non-GAAP financial measures are not standardized, it may not be possible to compare these financial measures with other companies' non-GAAP financial measures having the same or similar names. These adjusted financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for reported results. These non-GAAP financial measures reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of operations that, when viewed with GAAP results, provide a more complete understanding of the business. The company strongly encourages investors and shareholders to review company financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure.
The reconciliations provided below reconcile the non-GAAP financial measures adjusted net earnings, adjusted diluted earnings per share, adjusted operating earnings and adjusted segment operating earnings with GAAP financial measures:
