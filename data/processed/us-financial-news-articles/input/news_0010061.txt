Tomas Klevbo resigns as board member
Tomas Klevbo has informed the Chairman of the Board, Tomas Jalling that Klevbo, effective today, resigns from the Board in Invuo. The reason for leaving Invuo's Board is that since the listing of the former subsidiary Seamless Distribution Systems AB ("SDS"), where Klevbo is also a Board member, there has been several cases of potential conflict of interest, related to the fact that Invuo still holds 23.3 % of the shares in SDS. In order to be able to fully be able to contribute in the board of SDS, Klevbo has chosen to avoid any risk of future conflict of interest by resigning from Invuo's Board.
"Tomas Klevbo has made critical contributions as a member of Invuo's Board. By resigning from Invuo's Board, and thereby eliminating any risk of conflict of interest, Tomas Klevbo will able to fully participate in the important work as member of SDS' Board," says Tomas Jalling.
