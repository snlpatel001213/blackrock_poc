CLEARWATER, Fla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- MarineMax, Inc. (NYSE: HZO), the nation’s largest recreational boat and yacht retailer, today announced results for its first quarter ended December 31, 2017.
Revenue grew over $10 million, or 4.4% on top of 33% growth in the prior year, to $236.9 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 from $226.9 million in the comparable period last year. Same-store sales were flat as compared to 28% same-store sales growth in the same period last year, which concluded an 81% three-year stacked same-store sales growth period for the Company. The December quarter is typically the Company’s smallest revenue quarter of the year, which often results in a loss quarter for most marine dealers, including MarineMax.
The Company, for the fourth consecutive year, produced a profitable December quarter. Pretax earnings grew over 44% to $6.5 million, a December quarter record. For the quarter ended December 31, 2017, the Company produced record net income of $4.2 million and earnings per diluted share grew over 72% to $0.19 as compared to net income of $2.6 million or $0.11 per diluted share last year. The Company’s effective tax rate for the December quarter was reduced to 34.8% from 40.9% in the comparable period last year, due primarily to the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act legislation that was recently passed. Included in the December quarter is an increase in the Company’s income tax provision of $889,000, or $0.04 per diluted share, resulting from a re-measurement of the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities, as a result of the new tax legislation. Absent such increase, the Company’s diluted earnings per share would have been $0.23 in the quarter ended December 31, 2017.
William H. McGill, Jr., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer stated, “The strong execution by our team and the ongoing commitment to delivering enhanced and sustained cash flow with earnings growth, resulted in record profitability in our December quarter. Our focus on maintaining a disciplined sales and service approach, while having the right models of inventory, enabled our superior performance in the quarter. Trends in the quarter were generally encouraging as we experienced a healthy mix in product sales as well as an increase in our higher margin businesses, resulting in meaningful gross margin improvement over last year. Absent the additional expenses associated with the January 2017 acquisition we completed, our team controlled costs and produced strong leverage in the quarter which helped to drive our record earnings.”
Mr. McGill continued, “We began our important March quarter with a greater backlog than last year and thus far early boat shows are encouraging. With improving economic optimism, supported by the recent tax legislation, improving consumer confidence, and ample inventory, we are well-positioned to gain market share and drive positive growth in 2018.”
2018 Guidance
Based on current business conditions, the recently passed tax legislation, retail trends and other factors, the Company is raising its annual guidance expectations for fully taxed earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $1.30 to $1.40 for fiscal 2018 from its previous guidance of $1.10 to $1.20. These expectations do not take into account or give effect for future material acquisitions that may be completed by the Company during the fiscal year or other unforeseen events.
