WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States would stay in the Trans-Pacific Partnership, also known as TPP, if American negotiators were able to create a better agreement, U.S. President Donald Trump said on Thursday.
“I would do TPP if we made a much better deal than we had. We had a horrible deal,” Trump said in an interview with CNBC from the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.
