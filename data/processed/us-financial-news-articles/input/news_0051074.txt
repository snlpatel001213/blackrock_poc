The Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, a city landmark and historic venue for both sports and music, will become the United Airlines Memorial Coliseum in a $69 million deal struck between the airline and the coliseum’s operator, the University of Southern California, according to people familiar with the agreement. 
The deal, expected to be announced later Monday, is a crucial part of the university’s $270 million upgrade of the 95-year-old Coliseum ahead of the 2028 Summer Olympics, which the Los Angeles stadium will host. 
“Upgrading and renovating the L.A. Memorial Coliseum has been long overdue. It’s needed, it’s needed badly, and we are doing it now,” USC President C.L. Max Nikias said in an interview, ahead of the deal’s public announcement. “And it will be something, after the renovations are completed…that all Angelinos should be very proud of.” 
The Coliseum will become the only venue in the world to have hosted three Olympics; Los Angeles hosted the Summer Olympics there in 1932 and 1984. 
The venue is home to the USC Trojans football team and, through next year, the Los Angeles Rams NFL team. It will assume its new name starting in August 2019, officials from USC and UAL, +1.14% aid, when a new, co-branded logo will replace signs, including a historic marquee across the freeway.
