MILWAUKEE, Jan. 17, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bank Mutual Corporation (NASDAQ:BKMU) reported net income of $1.9 million or $0.04 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $4.1 million or $0.09 per diluted share in the same quarter of last year. On a full-year basis Bank Mutual Corporation (“Bank Mutual”) reported net income of $13.5 million or $0.30 per diluted share in 2017 compared to $17.0 million or $0.37 per diluted share in the same twelve-month period in 2016. The fourth quarter and full-year results of operations in 2017 each include a negative adjustment of $4.4 million to Bank Mutual’s net deferred tax asset as of December 31, 2017. This adjustment resulted from recent legislation that reduced the corporate federal income tax rate, as more fully described later in this release. Also included in Bank Mutual’s fourth quarter and full-year results of operations were $472,000 and $1.7 million, respectively, in expenses related to its pending merger with Associated Banc-Corp (“Associated,”) (NYSE:ASB), which was announced in a prior quarter.
Excluding the after-tax impact of the merger related expenses and deferred tax adjustment noted in the previous paragraph, Bank Mutual’s earnings during the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017, would have been $6.6 million and $19.1 million, respectively. Relative to the 2016 periods, Bank Mutual’s results of operations in 2017 were positively impacted by higher net interest income, a favorable change in provision for (recovery of) loan losses, higher brokerage, advisory, and insurance revenue, increased gains on sales of real estate held for investment, lower occupancy, equipment, and data processing costs, and a decline in other non-interest expenses. In addition, fourth quarter results in 2017 were favorably impacted by lower compensation-related expenses and the full-year results were favorably impacted by lower advertising and marketing expense compared to the prior year. The favorable developments in the 2017 periods were partially offset by a decrease in mortgage banking revenue and a decrease in loan-related fees compared to the same periods in 2016. In addition, the fourth quarter of 2017 was unfavorably impacted by higher advertising and marketing expense compared to the same period in the prior year. Finally, the full-year results in 2017 included a $197,000 loss on the sale of five retail branch offices, as well as an increase in compensation-related expenses and higher net losses and expenses on foreclosed real estate.
David A. Baumgarten, President and Chief Executive Officer of Bank Mutual, commented, “Our core operating results were strong in the fourth quarter due in part to continued declines in our non-performing and other classified assets.” He continued, “We feel very good about the quality of the loan portfolio we are bringing into the pending merger with Associated.” Mr. Baumgarten added, “We also feel good about the profitability of the existing book of business we are bringing to Associated, as evidenced by the improvement in net interest margin to 3.15% in the fourth quarter.” He concluded, “We believe the future is bright for the combination of these two exceptional financial institutions and we look forward to working with Associated to complete the integration.”
Bank Mutual’s net interest income increased by $1.3 million or 7.0% and $4.7 million or 6.5% during the three- and twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2017, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2016. Included in the three- and twelve-month periods in 2016 were $221,000 and $1.3 million, respectively, in call premiums that Bank Mutual received on mortgage-related securities that were called by the issuer in those periods. Excluding these call premiums, net interest income in the three- and twelve-month periods of 2017 increased by $1.5 million or 8.3% and $6.0 million or 8.4% compared to the same periods in 2016. This increase was caused in part by an increase in Bank Mutual’s average earning assets, which increased by $109.4 million or 4.6% during the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, compared to the same period in 2016. This increase was primarily attributable to an increase in average loans receivable. Also contributing to the increase in net interest income in the 2017 periods was an improvement in Bank Mutual’s net interest margin, excluding the impact of the aforementioned call premiums. Finally, an increase in funding from non-interest bearing checking accounts also contributed to the increase in net interest income in the 2017 periods.
Bank Mutual’s net interest margin was 3.15% and 3.09% during the three- and twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2017, respectively, which compared to 3.00% and 2.98% during the same periods in 2016 (excluding three and five basis points of benefit related to the aforementioned call premiums in the three- and twelve-month periods of 2016, respectively). Management has noted in recent periods that increases in the yield on Bank Mutual’s earning assets have exceeded the increases in its cost of funds. This has occurred in an environment of rising interest rates, due in part to increases in the fed funds rate by the Federal Reserve. Management attributes the increases in Bank Mutual’s net interest margin to an overall interest rate risk exposure that is asset sensitive. That is, management believes that the sensitivity of Bank Mutual’s earning assets to changes in market interest rates is greater than its interest-bearing liabilities.
Bank Mutual’s provision for (recovery of) loan losses was $(722,000) in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $1.0 million in the same quarter last year. On a full-year basis, provision for loan losses was $829,000 in 2017 compared to $3.0 million in 2016. The recovery in the fourth quarter of 2017 and the lower loss provision during the full-year of 2017 was primarily attributable to a decrease in Bank Mutual’s non-performing and other classified loans during the periods, as noted later in this release. Also contributing was the nominal level of net charge-offs during these periods.
Deposit-related fees and charges increased by $85,000 or 3.0% during the three months ended December 31, 2017, compared to the same period in 2016. On a full-year basis, deposit-related fees declined by $108,000 or 0.9% in 2017 compared to 2016. Deposit-related fees and charges consist of overdraft fees, ATM and debit card fees, merchant processing fees, account service charges, and other revenue items related to services performed by Bank Mutual for its retail and commercial deposit customers.
Brokerage, advisory, and insurance revenue was $853,000 during the fourth quarter of 2017, which was $207,000 or 32.0% higher than the same quarter in the prior year. On a full year basis this source of revenue was $3.2 million in 2017, which was $40,000 or 1.3% higher than 2016. This revenue item generally consists of commissions earned on sales of tax-deferred annuities, mutual funds, and certain other securities, fees earned for investment advisory services, and commissions earned on sales of personal and business insurance products.
