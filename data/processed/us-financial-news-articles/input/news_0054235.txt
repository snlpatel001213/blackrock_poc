Survey Results:
2017 was a profitable year for independent restaurants. 79% of the 882 responding independent restaurant owners or operators reported a net income greater than 1% of sales in 2017, of which, 31% reported a net income greater than 10%. Of those that were not profitable, approximately 10% broke even, while 11% reported a net loss greater than 1% of sales.
Profitability is on the rise as many independent restaurants performed better in 2017 than the previous year. 62% of respondents reported that their net income in 2017 outpaced their 2016 net income. Only 16% reported no change, and 22% reported lower net income in 2017 compared to 2016, indicating an overall upward trend in performance.
Independent restaurant operators are optimistic about 2018, and their optimism is trending upward. 65% of respondents indicated they are more optimistic about 2018 than they were about 2017. This is up from last year's survey results where only 56% of respondents felt more optimistic about 2017 compared to 2016.
For operators who are optimistic, over half (68%) attributed their optimism to improved business practices or systems. Over half (61%) of those who are not optimistic attributed it to challenging labors costs.
Independent restaurant operator goals reflect their optimism for 2018. Most (82%) identified four or more goals, indicating a desire to improve and grow in the new year. Over 50% of respondents reported they intend to focus on improving profitability, business practices, guest experience, or staff training, or that they are going to reduce their costs in 2018.
