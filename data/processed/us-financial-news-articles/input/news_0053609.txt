TJ Warren had 24 points and Josh Jackson had 20 points and eight rebounds for the Suns (17-34), who lost for the eighth time in nine games while playing without starters Devin Booker, Marquese Chriss and Tyson Chandler.
Booker, whose 24.7 scoring average is 11th in the league, suffered a rib injury when he took a nasty fall while contesting a shot by Houston’s Ryan Anderson with 3:46 remaining in the Suns’ 113-102 loss to the Rockets on Sunday.
Evans made all three of his 3-pointers in the final 94 seconds of the first half to enabled the Grizzlies to establish control with a 64-47 halftime lead.
Evans has 75 points, 15 rebounds and 14 assists in three games this season against the Suns, who won the first two in Phoenix by two points apiece.
Selden made his third consecutive start in place of Evans, who came off the bench after missing the previous two games with an illness.
Memphis shot 56.6 percent from the field. The Suns shot 46.3 percent.
The Suns made 7 of 21 3-pointers and they set an NBA record by making a 3-pointer in 1,109 consecutive games, breaking a tie with Dallas. Golden State has made a three in 1,103 games.
Greg Monroe had 14 points and Jared Dudley and Tyler Ulis had 13 for the Suns.
Warren followed his own miss to give the Suns a 19-9 lead, and the Suns stayed in front until Davis dunked an alley-oop pass from Mario Chalmers for a 30-29 lead the Grizzlies never lost.
Selden made two baskets and Gasol had a three-point play to cap an 11-0 run for a 54-40 lead.
The Grizzlies finished the half on a 23-7 run and pulled away with a 15-3 stretch for a 79-57 lead midway through the third quarter.
