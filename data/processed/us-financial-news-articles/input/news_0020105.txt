LIQUID MEDIA GROUP, INC.: Acquires 51% of Majesco Entertainment Company, and Announces $4,000,000 US Preferred Share Subscription
VANCOUVER, British Columbia, Jan. 15, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Leading Brands, Inc. (NASDAQ:LBIX), announces that it has amended its Definitive Arrangement Agreement with Liquid Media Group, Inc. and the results for its third quarter of fiscal 2017, which ended November 30, 2017. Unless otherwise stated, all financial amounts are denominated in Canadian dollars, with all financial figures rounded to the nearest $000.
On September 18, 2017 the Company announced that it had entered into a Definitive Arrangement Agreement with Liquid of Vancouver, Canada whereby LBIX would acquire 100% of Liquid pursuant to a plan of arrangement. Existing LBIX shareholders were anticipated to hold 22.637% and Liquid Shareholders were anticipated to hold 77.363% of the post-transaction entity. For those purposes, existing LBIX shares were valued at $1.50 US. As matters progressed and the transaction evolved, it became apparent that LBIX would have more cash available and that an adjustment of the exchange ratio to account for various transactions was appropriate. Consequently existing LBIX shares will now be valued at $1.78 US and the percentages of the combined entity held by each group of shareholders will be adjusted accordingly.
With the concurrent completion of the Liquid developments described below, it is anticipated that this transaction will now be completed by April 30, 2018.

Non-GAAP Measures
Any non-GAAP financial measures referenced in this release do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and are therefore unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers.
EBITDAS is a non-GAAP financial measure. EBITDAS is defined as net income (loss) before income taxes, interest expense, depreciation and amortization and stock-based compensation. EBITDAS should not be construed as a substitute for net income (as determined in accordance with GAAP) for the purpose of analyzing operating performance, as EBITDAS is not defined by GAAP. However, the Company regards EBITDAS as a complement to net income and income before taxes.
