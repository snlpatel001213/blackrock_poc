NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- AG Mortgage Investment Trust, Inc. (NYSE:MITT) (the “Company”), a real estate investment trust (REIT), announced today the tax treatment of common and preferred stock dividends declared in 2017. This information is provided to assist stockholders with tax reporting requirements related to dividend distributions of taxable income by the Company.
Stockholders should review the 2017 tax statements received from their brokerage firms or other institutions to ensure that the statements agree with the information provided below. Also, as each stockholder’s tax situation may be different, stockholders are encouraged to consult with their own professional tax advisor with respect to their specific tax treatment of the Company’s dividend distributions.
During 2017, the Company did not make any return of capital distributions. Additionally, because the Company is a REIT, dividends declared in the last month of a calendar year with a record date in that calendar year, but which are payable in January of the following year, are considered paid for Form 1099 reporting purposes on December 31 of the calendar year in which such dividend was declared, not on the payable date, to the extent the REIT has any remaining undistributed earnings and profits (as computed for income tax purposes) as of December 31 of that calendar year.
The Company's distributions per share on its common stock (CUSIP #001228105) are to be classified for income tax purposes as follows:
