Management Commentary
Parker H. "Pete" Petit, Chairman and CEO stated, "The fourth quarter of 2017 makes 28 consecutive quarters of sequential revenue growth and 27 of 28 quarters of meeting or exceeding our revenue guidance. At the end of November, we expected we would exceed our revenue forecast for the quarter, as we indicated in our press release on November 30, 2017. We forecasted December to be a solid growth month, and our sales force more than lived up to our expectations with a robust month to close out the year. We are entering 2018 with strong momentum that should produce an exciting 2018."
Bill Taylor, President and COO, noted, "Contributing to our accelerating sales momentum is the market growth we have achieved with our refined territory analytics for the larger markets and our effective secondary market strategy. The significant prospects for Venous Leg Ulcer (VLU) reimbursement coverage being added during 2018 as a result of the publication of the compelling results confirming the clinical efficacy of EpiFix® in the treatment of VLUs, will further fuel this momentum. As we stated earlier, with our current breadth of commercial carrier reimbursement coverage primarily for Diabetic Foot Ulcers (DFUs), we expect our 2018 Wound Care growth to be aided by our ability to ultimately achieve over 100 million additional commercial lives having EpiFix coverage for the treatment of VLUs."
"Both of our sales verticals had strong performances during the fourth quarter. Wound Care performed extremely well in the fourth quarter with 27% growth over the prior year's fourth quarter, and SSO revenue grew significantly over 2016 with 40% quarter over quarter growth. Fourth quarter revenue from our direct sales force represented approximately 95% of total revenue, and revenue from distributors and Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) accounted for less than 5% of total fourth quarter revenue," Taylor added.
Speaking to the Company's cash performance, Petit noted, "The fourth quarter was another quarter of very strong cash flow from operations. We are very pleased with the sustained progress we have made in this important measure of our operating effectiveness."
"We anticipate 2018 to be another year of highly predictable quarter over quarter revenue growth, continued strengthening of our balance sheet and cash position, and significant gains in profitability. Shareholders should be reminded that the 2017 numbers reported in this press release are preliminary numbers based on management's best estimates, and we look forward to our planned press release on February 23, 2018 detailing our 2017 financial results. We also plan to host our standard live broadcast of our 2017 financial results on February 23, 2018," concluded Petit.
