VISTA, Calif., Jan. 8, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- 2018 is the year that quality facial skincare technology can, for the first time, deliver the same great results in body care. NuFACEÂ®, pioneer in innovative, at-home, anti-aging solutions is proud to announce the launch of NuBODY, the first-ever, FDA-cleared microcurrent beauty device for the body.
How does NuBODY work? The microcurrent's unparalleled technology is in the front seat, giving women the power to take body confidence into their own hands (literally) and turn the anti-aging industry on its head. The device is specially engineered with four treatment spheres that synergistically work together to deliver a powerful, yet gentle flow of targeted microcurrent to the larger, denser areas of the body. The first-to-market device's exclusive Micro-4 Technology targets stubborn areas, such as arms, stomach, thighs and more, to help smooth away the look of dimpled, uneven skin. Best of all, NuBODY's energizing hum feels like a gentle massage with no pain, only gain.
No matter what (or where) the problem area may be, the clinically tested and scientifically proven results speak for themselves.

"Clients are super engaged and educated in a way I've never seen before, especially when it comes to beauty. After seeing the incredible success of the NuFACE, we are thrilled to expand the innovative microcurrent technology to the body. NuBODY truly breaks the mold by letting the busy, modern woman achieve a more firm, youthful looking appearance and physique with no downtime," says Founder and CEO, Tera Valdez-Peterson. "We have taken a concept, which began as facial-specific technology that could only be found in a professional skincare office, and have evolved it into a head-to-toe at-home anti-aging solution. It's safe to say, the future of beauty has arrived."
NuFACE is currently available in over 2,000 doors worldwide and in 18 international markets. NuBODY retails for $399, and is now available at MyNuFACE.com , select Neiman Marcus and Nordstrom stores as well as online, Revolve.com , Sephora.com , and select spas and professional skincare offices nationwide.
