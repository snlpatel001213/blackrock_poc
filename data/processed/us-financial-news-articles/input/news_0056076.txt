Congressional leaders and the Air Force want a “new” plane for attacking terrorist tents and camps (“Air Force Looks at Low-Cost Squadron,” page one, Jan. 20). Have any of them ever heard about the A-10 Thunderbolt II, aka the Warthog? It was built for this kind of job, carries a huge load of ordnance and has great protection for the pilots. There are probably hundreds of them lying around in boneyards somewhere in the Southwest.
