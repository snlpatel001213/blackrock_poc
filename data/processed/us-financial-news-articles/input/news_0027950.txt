KITZBUEHEL, Austria (Reuters) - Germany’s Thomas Dressen tamed the dangerous Streif course to snatch a surprise victory in the men’s downhill on Saturday and beat specialist Beat Feuz and Aksel Lund Svindal.
With the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics only three weeks away, the 24-year-old was superb as he charged down the awe-inspiring course in a near flawless race for his first World Cup win.

Swiss Feuz, who led for a long time, was second a week after winning in Wengen, while Austrian Hannes Reichelt was third.
Norwegian Svindal, who had suffered a season-ending injury at the Streif two years ago, won the Super-G on Friday but managed only eighth place in the downhill.
