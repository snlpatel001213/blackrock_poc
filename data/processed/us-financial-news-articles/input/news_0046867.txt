Marach became just the third Austrian to win a men’s doubles grand slam title after Julian Knowle won the 2007 U.S. Open with Simon Aspelin, and Jurgen Melzer claimed the 2010 Wimbledon and the 2011 U.S. Open championships with Philipp Petzschner. 
Pavic made himself the second Croatian doubles player to win a major trophy after Ivan Dodig, the 2015 French Open winner with Marcelo Melo. Editing by Pritha Sarkar
