ABUJA, Jan 25 (Reuters) - Nigeria will protest to the United States over certain conditions of its planned purchase of 12 A29 Super Tucano fighter planes, the West African countryâ€™s defence minister said on Thursday.
Those conditions include the 2020 transfer date for the aircraft and that Nigerian technicians will not be trained by U.S. staff, be part of maintenance crews, nor can they study the production of the planes, Mansur Dan Ali told reporters at a briefing in Abuja.
