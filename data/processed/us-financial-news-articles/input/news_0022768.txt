SUNNYVALE, Calif., Jan. 17, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NetApp (NASDAQ:NTAP) today announced the appointment of Brad Anderson as the senior vice president and general manager (GM) of the NetApp Cloud Infrastructure business unit.
NetApp has a significant opportunity to help customers build next-generation data centers with the scale, quality of service and rapid time-to-value that modern applications and software development paradigms require. Reporting to NetApp CEO George Kurian, Anderson will be instrumental in driving the strategy and the execution that are necessary to give customers a framework for their cloud-architected data centers.

“Brad understands how to focus an organization to evolve rapidly in response to a dynamic market and has a track record of turning multiple emerging products into multimillion- and billion-dollar businesses,” said Kurian. “He brings the leadership experience that we need to both shape direction and lead the company-wide execution that is necessary to further expand our Cloud Infrastructure business.
“Bringing Brad on board is further proof of our commitment to expanding our leadership talent and capabilities. It also demonstrates to the industry our serious commitment to establishing a leadership role in helping customers build their next-generation data centers with our best-in-class converged infrastructure and hyper converged infrastructure solutions,” continued Kurian.
