HAVERHILL, Mass., Jan. 31, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Retail Automotive veteran and entrepreneur Louis Rylant of Bedford, NH has been named General Manager of Jaffarian Toyota in Haverhill, MA. Having spent the last 18 years in retail automotive, Rylant gained key experience with two of the largest groups in New England, Ira Motor Group and Prime Motor Group.
Rylant sees the opportunity at Jaffarian Toyota as his most exciting yet, "the store means a lot to the local community and has for a lot of years. I'm really looking forward to working with such a great team and continuing to be a big part of the Merrimack Valley business community."
His goals include process improvements in the store and expanding an already growing operation including the service and parts department. Rylant says the dealership will be hiring across all departments to support the growth. The store is one of the oldest Toyota stores in New England still under the same family ownership and serves not only the greater Merrimack Valley, including Haverhill, Bradford, Lawerence, Andover and Lowell, but also southern New Hampshire.
The timing for this move is well-aligned with Toyota's launch of the completely redesigned 2018 model year Camry. Rylant sees Toyota's revamp of America's best-selling sedan as bucking the trend toward SUVs and crossovers: "Toyota is an incredible company and what they have done to enhance an already incredible car is proof of that."
When Louis isn't working long hours at the dealership he spends time with his wife and his twin daughters. Travelling is the family's favorite pastime, and favorite spots include coastal Maine, Hawaii, and Disney World.
