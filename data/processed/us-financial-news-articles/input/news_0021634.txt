Local favorite Kyrgios is shouldering his nation’s hopes of a first home men’s champion since 1976 and he got his campaign off to a flying start with a straight-sets win over Brazilian Rogerio Dutra Silva.
Having claimed the Brisbane title this month, his first on the home soil, there is real optimism that the 22-year-old might mount a serious title challenge in Melbourne.

Troicki has often built his campaign on the back of a strong start to his season in Sydney, where he reached the semi-finals last season, but the Serb fell in the first round this month.
