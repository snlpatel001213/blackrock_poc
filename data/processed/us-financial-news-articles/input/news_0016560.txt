Manning, a former Army intelligence analyst, was convicted in 2013 of leaking a vast trove of Army documents, videos, and other materials to WikiLeaks. They included evidence of what Manning later described as “missteps” and “misguided policies” in the prosecution of the war in Iraq. 
Manning was pardoned by President Barack Obama in 2017, days before he left office. Manning was born male, and was known as Bradley Manning before changing her name to Chelsea and suing for sex reassignment surgery and hormone treatments while in prison. SPONSORED FINANCIAL CONTENT
