Police are investigating whether he illegally received a 2 million euro EU subsidy a decade ago by hiding ownership of a farm and conference centre. Babis denies wrongdoing. 
Babis was speaking before a parliamentary committee meets on Tuesday to make a recommendation on whether to lift Babisâ€™s immunity from prosecution that he is granted as an elected member of the chamber. Reporting by Jason Hovet;
