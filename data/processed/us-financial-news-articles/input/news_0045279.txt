SINGAPORE, Jan 24 (Reuters) - The dollar slipped to a four-month low against the yen on Wednesday, pressured by simmering concerns that the U.S. currencyâ€™s yield advantage will start to erode as major central banks head toward unwinding their massive stimulus.
The dollar touched a low of 110.06 yen at one point, its lowest level since Sept. 15, and was last trading at 110.16 yen, down 0.1 percent from late U.S. trade on Tuesday. (Reporting by Masayuki Kitano; Editing by Shri Navaratnam)
