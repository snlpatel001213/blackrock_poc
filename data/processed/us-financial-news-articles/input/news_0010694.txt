BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany’s would-be coalition partners reached agreement on a law to attract qualified labour to Germany, German media reported on Tuesday, citing a paper from a working group in the exploratory talks between the parties. 
Immigration is one of the most sensitive topics in the talks between Chancellor Angela Merkel’s conservatives and the centre-left Social Democrats. 
The agreement on that topic, following compromises on tax and carbon emissions policy achieved on Monday, suggested the parties are inching closer to a decision to open formal coalition talks. Reporting by Thomas Escritt, editing by Michelle Martin
