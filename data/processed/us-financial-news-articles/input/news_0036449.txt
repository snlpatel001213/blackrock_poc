Operating Highlights for the Second Fiscal Quarter Ended November 30, 2017
Total student enrollments in academic subjects tutoring and test preparation courses increased by 43% year-over-year to approximately 1,877,100 for the second fiscal quarter of 2018. The total number of schools and learning centers was 940 as of November 30, 2017, an increase of 151 compared to 789 as of November 30, 2016, and a net increase of 41 compared to 899 as of August 31, 2017. The total number of schools was 82 as of November 30, 2017.
Michael Minhong Yu, New Oriental's Executive Chairman, commented, "We continued to see strong momentum in our key business units for the second quarter of fiscal year 2018 and achieved an accelerated revenue growth of 36.9% year-over-year, exceeding our initial expectation once again. It is also encouraging to see our deferred revenue balance recorded US$1,137.3 million at the end of the quarter, up 48.7% year-over-year. The solid top line growth is mainly driven by student enrollments. Our K-12 all-subjects after-school tutoring business growth was augmented in the second quarter with revenue up approximately 47% and enrollment up approximately 52% year-over-year. Moreover, our U-Can middle and high school all-subjects after-school tutoring business achieved revenue growth of approximately 45% and the revenue of POP Kids program rose approximately 51% year-over-year."
Chenggang Zhou, New Oriental's Chief Executive Officer, added, "Guided by our well-proven 'Optimize the Market' strategy, we are steadily facilitating our capacity expansion across cities with strong growth potential and where we could achieve better operating efficiency. During this quarter, we added a net of 34 learning centers in 19 existing cities and tapped into the cities of Yinchuan, Shaoxing and Huzhou with our dual-teacher model classes implemented in three new schools and three learning centers. In addition, we acquired one kindergarten in Hong Kong, bringing our high-quality preschool education offerings to key cities in China. Altogether, our total square meters of classroom area by the end of this quarter expanded approximately 38% year-over-year. On the other hand, we continued to enhance our online and offline integrated standardized teaching system in the K-12 business with improved customer acquisition and retention, which markedly benefited our results in the second quarter. We also made continued progress in rolling out the standardized teaching system for overseas test preparation business, such as IELTS, TOEFL and SAT programs, in some of the large cities in China. Meanwhile, our pure online education platform, Koolearn.com , obtained year-over-year revenue growth of approximately 59.6%, with a significant rise of approximately 82% for registered users and 23% for paid users. It validates the success of our strategy to acquire and effectively retain customers and expand capacity, and we believe it will help taking more and more market shares and solidify our leadership position."
Stephen Zhihui Yang, New Oriental's Chief Financial Officer, commented, "Despite the fact that the second quarter is traditionally the slowest quarter in the year, we still managed to improve the utilization of facilities compared with last quarter. This helps to lessen the pressure on margins as we continued the investment in capacity expansion and as expected we are on the right track to recover from the impact on the margins in the previous quarter. For the second quarter, the year-over-year decline of gross margin narrowed to 70 basis points from 280 basis points in the previous quarter, while Non-GAAP operating margin declined 150 basis points year-over-year, which is also recovering compared to 390 basis points in the previous quarter. We will continue to make efforts to enhance cost efficiency and improve utilization of facilities to drive the top line and bottom line growth. We still believe margin pressure will gradually lessen over the coming quarters. More importantly, we will increasingly benefit from economies of scale as we continue to push ahead our expansion strategy and work to deliver long-term value for our customers and shareholders."

About Non-GAAP Financial Measures
To supplement New Oriental's consolidated financial results presented in accordance with GAAP, New Oriental uses the following measures defined as non-GAAP financial measures by the SEC: net income excluding share-based compensation expenses, operating income excluding share-based compensation expenses, operating costs and expenses excluding share-based compensation expenses, general and administrative expenses excluding share-based compensation expenses, operating margin excluding share-based compensation expenses, and basic and diluted net income per ADS and per share excluding share-based compensation expenses. The presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. For more information on these non-GAAP financial measures, please see the tables captioned "Reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures" set forth at the end of this release.
New Oriental believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding its performance and liquidity by excluding share-based compensation expenses that may not be indicative of its operating performance from a cash perspective. New Oriental believes that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing its performance and when planning and forecasting future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management's internal comparisons to New Oriental's historical performance and liquidity. New Oriental computes its non-GAAP financial measures using the same consistent method from quarter to quarter. New Oriental believes these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors in allowing for greater transparency with respect to supplemental information used by management in its financial and operational decision making. A limitation of using these non-GAAP measures is that they exclude share-based compensation charge that has been and will continue to be for the foreseeable future a significant recurring expense in our business. Management compensates for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from each non-GAAP measure. The accompanying tables have more details on the reconciliations between GAAP financial measures that are most directly comparable to non-GAAP financial measures.
