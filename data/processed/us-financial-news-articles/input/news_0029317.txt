NEW YORK, Notice is hereby given that Monteverde & Associates PC has filed a class action lawsuit in the United States District Court for The District of Connecticut, case no. 3:18-cv-00083, on behalf of stockholders of Aetna, Inc, ("Aetna" or the "Company") (NYSE: AET) who held Aetna securities and have been harmed by Aetna and its board of directors' (the "Board") for alleged violations of Sections 14(a), and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act") in connection with the sale of the Company to CVS Health Corporation.
Under the terms of the agreement, each stock of Aetna's public common stockholders will be converted into the right to receive (i) 0.8378 (the "Exchange Ratio") fully paid and non-assessable shares of CVS Common Stock (the "Share Consideration") and (ii) $145.00 in cash without interest thereon (the "Cash Consideration" and, together with the Share Consideration, the "Merger Consideration"), which would value Aetna at approximately $207.94 per share. The Proposed Transaction is valued at approximately $77 billion. The complaint alleges that S-4 contains materially incomplete and misleading information concerning: (i) financial projections for the Company; (ii) the valuation analyses performed by the Company's financial advisor, Lazard FreÌ€res & Co. LLC ("Lazard"), in support of its fairness opinions; (iii) the terms and details surrounding any alternative indications of interest in the Company solicited or received from other company; and (iv) the actual Merger Consideration.
