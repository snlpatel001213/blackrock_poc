BOSTON, Jan. 31, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Eaton Vance Management (International) Limited (EVMI), a subsidiary of Eaton Vance Corp. (NYSE: EV), today announced an agreement to hire a five-person global fixed-income team led by Astrid Vogler that was formerly employed by Oechsle International Advisors, LLC (Oechsle), a privately held investment manager.
