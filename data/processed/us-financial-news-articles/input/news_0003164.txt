SASKATOON, Saskatchewan--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- CanniMed Therapeutics Inc.

The full text of the letter to shareholders is below and has been filed on SEDAR and mailed to shareholders.
AURORA’S HOSTILE BID WILL LEAVE YOU WITH NOTHING.
The Aurora rip-off has already started. Question the negative impact Aurora has had on your CanniMed shares already and the currency being offered.
Aurora’s hostile bid is holding CanniMed’s share price back.
Your CanniMed shares are already trading above Aurora's capped offer of $24.00 and would likely be even higher if Aurora's hostile bid was not weighing the share price down. This is real value that you should have earned and are entitled to. Aurora’s cap means you will not benefit as the cannabis space continues to rise in value. What Aurora’s offer will do is leave you with unlimited downside risk, where you could lose the value you perceive.
Question the currency Aurora is offering.
Instead of cash, Aurora is offering you inflated shares – shares that were worth only half as much just two weeks before its hostile bid was announced. The 110% run up in Aurora’s share price is not based on anything Aurora did – just pure speculation. This run up may be good for current Aurora shareholders, but future shareholders (including CanniMed shareholders who tender into the bid) will not benefit from any part of it.
The actions of Aurora insiders demonstrate they know their share price is unsustainable.
• Four insiders, including the CEO, dumped over $17.8 million in Aurora shares just one day before the share price fell over 14%, after they made the offer to CanniMed.
• At the same time they were selling their own Aurora shares they were asking you to accept Aurora shares for your shares of CanniMed.
• Aurora’s management have sold off more than $42.9 million worth of shares in 2017.
• Locked-up shareholders have included exclusive downside protection on the share price of CanniMed shares at $16.00 and $18.00 (based on certain conditions).
There is a reason why Aurora has consistently been one of the most shorted stocks in the cannabis space.
How long until the market catches on to Aurora’s growing pattern of problems – two product recalls, signature production facility with increasing costs and behind schedule, and a reckless buying spree that has spread Aurora’s management thin?
Why would you want to be the one carrying that risk?
Aurora’s hostile bid is NOT driving CanniMed’s share price – it’s holding it back from going even higher!
AURORA KNOWS ITS OFFER IS A BAD DEAL FOR CANNIMED SHAREHOLDERS
“…it makes sense for us to grab assets in Canada [like CanniMed]… at incredibly attractive valuations and they’ll be worth two or three times those valuations in 12 months…” – Aurora’s Executive Vice President, Cam Battley
This implies a minimum value of $30 for CanniMed shares based on CanniMed’s share price at the time of the offer. Aurora is trying to grab your shares without paying you fair value for them. Don’t let them get away with it!
CANNIMED’S ACQUISITION OF NEWSTRIKE WILL MAKE YOUR SHARES MORE VALUABLE – ESPECIALLY TO AURORA.
In early 2017, CanniMed promised you we would provide an opportunity to take advantage of the soon-to-be booming $8 billion Canadian recreational market. Our acquisition of Newstrike and its Up Cannabis brand, tied to the iconic Canadian band, The Tragically Hip, will do just that.
With the advice of two independent financial advisors, external legal advisors, and the unanimous recommendation by the special committee of independent directors, your CanniMed board of directors has concluded that acquiring Newstrike presents the best opportunity for significant financial returns and recommends NOT TO TENDER TO AURORA’S HOSTILE BID THAT OFFERS PHANTOM VALUE BASED ON AN INFLATED SHARE PRICE.
The combination of CanniMed and Newstrike creates a major player across the Canadian recreational and global medical markets and will be valued as such. 2018 is the time to realize optimal value for your CanniMed shares – now is not the time to sell out! We see a clear path to $37 per CanniMed share — or more.
CanniMed is incredibly well-positioned with its industry leading oils capability which, based on current oils product pricing, will have the capacity to generate over $1 billion in annual revenue and 70+% profit margins. Based on our market experience and observation of the global medical markets and U.S. state markets, we believe oils and oil derivatives will represent 50+% of the Canadian and global markets and CanniMed’s operating results will accordingly lead the industry. The combined planned grow capacity of CanniMed and Newstrike of 45,000 kg will place it among the sector leaders. All of this points to a higher share price and real value delivered to you as a shareholder.
The Newstrike acquisition is accretive. Aurora’s offer is dilutive.
On a standalone basis CanniMed provides $1.34 EBITDA 1 per share and with Newstrike you see 14.6% accretion to $1.54 EBITDA per share. Conversely, by tendering to Aurora’s hostile bid, you will see a 36.7% dilution to $0.85 EBITDA per share. This means Aurora is offering you $0.69 or 45% less than what a combined CanniMed and Newstrike offers you.

Aurora’s hostile bid is NOT driving CanniMed’s share price. It’s holding it back.
Aurora’s hostile bid is already capping your share price – without this noise CanniMed’s share price is likely to have traded well above the Aurora capped offer of $24.
Since November 14th, 2017, the last trading day before Aurora announced its intention to launch its hostile bid, the average share price in the cannabis sector has increased by 70.9%. This means that if CanniMed shares had not been constrained by the hostile actions of Aurora and the locked-up shareholders (and been allowed to trade in-line with its peers) your CanniMed shares would be worth $26.15 BEFORE accounting for the accretion from the Newstrike acquisition. This is real value that should have been earned by CanniMed shareholders that Aurora and the locked-up shareholders clearly don’t want you to have.
Furthermore, when you combine this realizati
