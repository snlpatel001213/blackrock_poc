BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazilian Industry Minister Marcos Pereira resigned on Wednesday, the third cabinet minister to quit in a month.
Pereira, who posted his resignation letter on his verified Facebook page, is expected to run for Congress in October for his Brazilian Republican Party.
In his resignation letter he cited “personal and party” reasons for leaving the job and thanked President Michel Temer for the posting.
