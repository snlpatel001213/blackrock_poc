LONDON (Reuters) - Singaporean billionaire Kwek Leng Beng has failed in his attempt to take over London-listed Millennium & Copthorne Hotels ( MLC.L ) after a group of minority investors blocked the deal. 
City Developments Limited (CDL), Kwek’s vehicle which is also M&C’s majority shareholder, secured acceptances from 47.14 percent of the hotelier’s minority investors for its 620-pence-a-share offer, falling short of the 50 percent needed for the bid to become unconditional, CDL said in a statement on Friday. 
The failure of CDL’s offer sent M&C shares down more than 6 percent to 538 pence in London at 1631 GMT. 
The bid, which valued M&C as a whole at 2 billion pounds ($2.8 billion), faced fierce criticism from three minority investors, who rejected it on the grounds that it materially undervalued the hotelier. 
The trio of International Value Advisers, MSD Partners and Classic Fund Management called on other shareholders to help them to block the deal by spurning the offer. 
The three minorities said in a letter last month they alone accounted for 37 percent of the shares targeted by Kwek’s bid. 
The deadline for minority investors to accept CDL’s offer was 1300 GMT on Friday. M&C runs, franchises and operates 137 hotels around the world, including sites in London and New York. CDL already owns 65.2 percent of the business and Kwek is M&C’s chairman. 
“The board of CDL respects the decision of the offeree shareholders,” the Singaporean company said. 
“CDL remains committed to maintaining its controlling shareholding in the offeree, supporting the offeree’s strategy as a hotel owner and operator and the extensive capital expenditure program required to improve performance.”
