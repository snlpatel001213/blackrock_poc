BEIRUT (Reuters) - The Syrian Kurdish YPG militia said Turkish troops tried to cross the countries’ border into the Afrin region on Sunday but were forced back.
Birusk Hasaka, the YPG spokesman in Afrin, said Turkish forces were repulsed after fierce clashes.
Another YPG official, Nouri Mahmoudi, said “all the Turkish military’s ground attacks against Afrin have been repelled so far and they have been forced to retreat.”
Ankara earlier said the Turkish military had entered Afrin.
