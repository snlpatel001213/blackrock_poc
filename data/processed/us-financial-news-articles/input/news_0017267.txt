MUMBAI, Jan 13 (Reuters) - IDFC Bank Ltd, one of Indiaâ€™s two newest banks, said on Saturday its board has approved a takeover of non-bank financial firm Capital First Ltd in a share swap deal.
Shareholders in Capital First will receive 139 shares of the bank for every 10 shares held, the lender said in a stock exchange filing. The deal is conditional on central bank and other regulatory approvals.
Capital First, owned more than a third by private equity firm Warburg Pincus, also counts Singapore state investor GIC among its major investors. (Reporting by Suvashree Dey Choudhury and Devidutta Tripathy; Editing by Shri Navaratnam)
