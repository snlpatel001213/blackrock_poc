WASHINGTON, Jan 25 (Reuters) - Facebook last year removed Moscow-based Kaspersky Lab from its list of anti-virus offerings made to users who access the social media site from a computer that may be infected with malicious code, the company told Congress in responses to questions from lawmakers made public on Thursday.
“In October 2017, we removed Kaspersky’s anti-virus software from the list of products that we make available to these users,” Facebook wrote in a letter dated Jan. 8 in answers provided to the Senate Intelligence Committee. (Reporting by Dustin Volz; Editing by Phil Berlowitz)
