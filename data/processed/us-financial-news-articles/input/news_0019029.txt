MONROVIA (Reuters) - Liberia’s ruling Unity Party has expelled the west African nation’s outgoing president, Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, following its candidate’s defeat in a presidential run-off election last month, the party said in a statement distributed on Sunday. 
The statement said Johnson Sirleaf had violated rules, including a requirement to support the party’s candidates in elections. Former football star George Weah defeated the Unity Party’s Joseph Boakai in a landslide. Reporting by Alphonso Toweh; Writing by Joe Bavier; editing by Louise Heavens
