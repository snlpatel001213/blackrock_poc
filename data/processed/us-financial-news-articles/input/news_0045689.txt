CARACAS, Jan 25 (Reuters) - Venezuela is seeking an Interpol red alert for former oil czar Rafael Ramirez, who has been accused of corruption, Chief Prosecutor Tarek Saab said in a press conference on Thursday.
Reuters was unable to immediately obtain comment from Ramirez, whose current location is not known. Ramirez, who was the all-powerful head of the oil ministry and state energy company PDVSA for a decade, has long been a rival of President Nicolas Maduro.
