Jan 22 (Reuters) - Indiaâ€™s Axis Bank Ltd posted a 25 percent rise in quarterly net profit, helped by higher interest and fee incomes as well as a drop in provisions for bad loans, although results fell slightly short of a consensus estimate.
Net profit rose to 7.26 billion rupees ($113.86 million) for the quarter ended December, from 5.80 billion rupees a year ago, the country's third-largest private sector lender by assets said on Monday. bit.ly/2DqYf7L
