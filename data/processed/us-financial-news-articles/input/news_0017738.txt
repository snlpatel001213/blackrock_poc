Sophomore forward Rui Hachimura matched his career high of 20 points on 8-of-10 shooting for the Bulldogs (15-3, 5-0 WCC), who defeated the Pilots for the ninth consecutive time. Sophomore forward Killian Tillie added 15 points and junior guard Josh Perkins contributed 13 points and seven assists as Gonzaga topped 100 points for the sixth time this season.
The Bulldogs have won their five WCC games by an average of 35.4 points. Gonzaga is 37-2 against Portland during coach Mark Few’s 18 seasons.
Freshman guard Marcus Shaver Jr. scored 16 points for the Pilots (6-12, 0-5), who have dropped their last five games. Sophomore guard Franklin Porter added 11 points for Portland, which shot just 30 percent from the field while being outrebounded 50-32.
