The merger of Dr Pepper Snapple and Keurig Green Mountain , announced Monday, will create a new giant in the food and beverage industry—but there’s a lot more to the deal than the marquee brands that spring to mind when you hear the company names. 
Dr Pepper Snapple has extensive holdings of smaller, but still very familiar brands, including the Margaritaville mixers. (Jimmy Buffett still owns the rights to the name itself and other Margaritaville holdings.) Other properties include a popular root beer and an apple juice/applesauce manufacturer.
