PRAGUE (Reuters) - Incumbent Milos Zeman led the first round of the Czech Republicâ€™s presidential election on Saturday with 44.2 percent of the vote, results from 10.6 percent of voting districts showed.
The runner up was Jiri Drahos, a pro-Western academic, with 24.2 percent, far ahead of the remaining seven contenders.
Unless the winner takes more than 50 percent in the first round, the two highest-scoring candidates will go head to head in a run-off planned for Jan. 26-27.
