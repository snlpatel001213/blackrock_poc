* Brent oil hits $70/bbl during session, highest since Nov 2014 (Updates with U.S. markets' closing levels)

The S&P energy index jumped 2 percent, leading gains among S&P sectors. Optimism about upcoming U.S. earnings also helped U.S. stocks, which resumed their 2018 rally to hit record closing highs.
"The unifying factor of today's move and this whole week is a heightened confidence in the pace of economic activity. That helps explain the demand picture which has oil up at $70," said Scott Clemons, chief investment strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman, in New York.
Brent crude futures settled 6 cents higher at $69.26, after hitting $70.05 during the session, its highest level since November 2014. Brent's settlement still represents a three-year closing high.
