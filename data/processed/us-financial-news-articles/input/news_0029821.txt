SOFIA (Reuters) - German Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Saturday she was optimistic that the centre-left Social Democrats (SPD) would approve the start of formal coalition talks with her conservative CDU party at a special congress on Sunday.
“We will wait for the SPD party congress and then hopefully start coalition talks,” Merkel said during a news conference in Sofia.
Merkel added she was convinced that European leaders would strengthen the euro zone, for example by agreeing on further measures to complete a banking union.
