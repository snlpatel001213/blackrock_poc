Nintendo Switch owners have waited for Netflix streaming ever since the gaming consoles debuted nearly a year ago. And based on a recent comment from Netflix, there’s still may be hope that streaming is coming. 
A Twitter user tweeted at Netflix’s customer service account over the weekend to ask if the company planned to make streaming available on the Switch. In response, the @NetflixHelps account said that “there are currently no plans for Netflix on Nintendo Switch.” 
That answer didn’t sit well with Switch fans , many of whom have been waiting for Netflix streaming to become available through Nintendo’s latest console. Video gaming site Polygon contacted Netflix for clarification about the tweet and for comment about the ensuing outcry. 
In response, Netflix said that it’s “still exploring the opportunity with Nintendo” and said that it couldn’t share any “definitive plans.” Netflix also removed its customer service team’s earlier tweet.

When Nintendo introduced the Switch in March, streaming video services, including Netflix and Hulu, were conspicuously absent despite their availability on competing devices like Microsoft’s Xbox One and Sony’s PlayStation 4. Nintendo has promised to make the Switch compatible with more apps, but, so far, it has only done so for Hulu . 
While the Hulu addition was a notable one, users want Netflix more than any other. And each time Nintendo and Netflix have been asked about the matter, the companies have avoided making any promises. SPONSORED FINANCIAL CONTENT
