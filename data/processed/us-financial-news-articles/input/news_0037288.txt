BERLIN, Jan 23 (Reuters) - Germany’s DIHK Chambers of Commerce said on Tuesday it was raising its forecast for German export growth in 2018 to at least 6 percent from 4.5 percent seen in the autumn.
“Exports are developing dynamically, especially with our resurgent neighbours in Europe,” the DIHK’s foreign trade chief, Volker Treier, told Reuters.
