WASHINGTON — Republican lawmakers warned President Donald Trump Sunday against firing special counsel Robert Mueller, in the wake of reports last week that the president considered dismissing him in June. 
“It’s pretty clear to me that everybody in the White House knows it would be the end of President Trump’s presidency if he fired Mr. Mueller,” Sen. Lindsey Graham, R.-S.C., said Sunday on ABC. GOP leaders have remained supportive of Mueller, who is leading an investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. 
Republican lawmakers said Sunday that it would be a mistake for Trump to attempt to dislodge Mueller, who is investigating whether the president’s campaign colluded with Russia’s interference in the presidential election. Mueller “didn’t raise his hand and say ‘pick me.’ We as a country asked him to do this,” Rep. Trey Gowdy, R.-S.C., chairman of the House Oversight Committee, said on Fox News Sunday. Gowdy said his GOP colleagues should “leave him the hell alone.” 
Sen. Susan Collins, R.-Maine, said it “obviously would be a terrible mistake” if Trump tried to fire Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who tapped Mueller to spearhead the investigation. Special counsels operate outside the normal Justice Department chain of command.
