(Reuters) - Casey’s General Stores Inc ( CASY.O ) has submitted a bid for Kroger Co’s ( KR.N ) convenience-store business that is worth about $2 billion, CNBC reported on Friday, citing sources familiar with the matter.
JCP Investment Management in January had asked Casey's to explore strategic alternatives, including a potential sale, and CNBC said buying Kroger's convenience-store business could stave off pressure to sell. ( cnb.cx/2nekVBR )
