KIEV (Reuters) - Germany is worried about the situation in Iran escalating, Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel said on Wednesday.
Speaking to reporters on a visit to Ukraine, Gabriel also said he was skeptical that a decision by the United States to supply lethal weapons to Ukraine would help lead to a resolution of the Donbass conflict.
