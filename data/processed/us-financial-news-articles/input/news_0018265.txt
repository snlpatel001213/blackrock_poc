On January 2, 2018, The Register reported that a “fundamental design flaw” in Intel chips could make it possible for “hackers to exploit other security bugs or, worse, expose secure information such as passwords, thus compromising individual computers or even entire server networks.” Media reports are suggesting that security patches may drastically slow down device performance. Upon this news, shares of Intel Corporation stock were down 6.5% during intraday trading on January 3, 2018.
