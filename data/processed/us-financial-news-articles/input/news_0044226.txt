(Reuters) - A group of Kentucky residents have filed a lawsuit challenging the federal government’s approval of new requirements that people who receive benefits from the state’s Medicaid health insurance programme work or get jobs training.
The proposed class action lawsuit, filed in Washington federal court against the U.S. Department of Health and Services (HHS), says that the agency exceeded its authority under the federal Medicaid law when it approved Kentucky’s requirements earlier this month.
Kentucky’s new requirements mandate that able-bodied adult Medicaid recipients participate in at least 80 hours a month of “employment activities,” including jobs training, education and community service. They were approved through a process that allows states to receive “waivers” from federal Medicaid law in order to test new approaches to the 50-year-old programme.
Wednesday’s lawsuit said that Kentucky’s waiver has “effectively rewritten” the federal Medicaid law, “bypassing congressional restrictions, overturning a half century of administrative practice, and threatening irreparable harm to the health and welfare of the poorest and most vulnerable in our country.”
The lawsuit was filed by 15 Kentucky residents enrolled in Medicaid and seeks to represent a class of all Kentucky residents enrolled in the programme since Jan. 18. Attorneys at the National Health Law Program and Southern Poverty Law Center, left-leaning national advocacy groups, are among those representing them.
