(Reuters) - Striker Robin van Persie will be returning to boyhood club Feyenoord from Turkish side Fenerbahce next week, the Dutch champions said on Friday. 
The 34-year-old, who has scored 36 goals in all competitions during his time in Turkey since 2015, will sign a contract with Feyenoord on Monday to seal his return to the club where he began his professional career in 2002. 
“Nothing stands in the way of a return from the 102-fold international to De Kuip, now that he has come to an agreement with his current club Fenerbahce about the dissolution of his contract,” the Dutch club said in a statement. 
“Feyenoord and Van Persie reached an agreement about the return earlier this week.” 
Van Persie, who previously had spells at Arsenal and Manchester United in the Premier League, scored 22 goals in three seasons for Feyenoord before joining the Gunners in 2004. 
The Dutchman also featured for his country in three World Cups, notching up 102 appearances in total and scoring a record 50 goals. Reporting by Christian Radnedge, editing by Pritha Sarkar
