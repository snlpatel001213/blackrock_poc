“A spin is the preferred solution,” one of the people said, adding that the move may come very soon. “They are in active talks.” 
Kering is working with an advisor on the deal, the person said, while another source said that a Puma spin has long been discussed by Kering. 
Kering, which is controlled by the French Pinault family, owns 85 percent of Puma. 
A spin-off would see this Puma stake distributed among Kering’s shareholders, giving the Pinault family a direct stake in the sporting goods company. 
Kering and Artemis - the Pinault family’s investment vehicle - did not respond to request for comment, while Puma declined to comment. Additional reporting by Alexander Hübner and Sarah White, editing by Emma Thomasson
