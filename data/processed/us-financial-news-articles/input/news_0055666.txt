CORK, Ireland, Jan. 31, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Johnson Controls International plc (NYSE: JCI) today reported fiscal first quarter 2018 GAAP earnings per share ("EPS") from continuing operations, including special items, of $0.25. Excluding these items, adjusted EPS from continuing operations was $0.54, up 2% versus the prior year period (see attached footnotes for non-GAAP reconciliation).
Sales of $7.4 billion increased 5% compared to the prior year. Excluding the impacts of M&A, foreign exchange and changes in lead prices, total sales grew 3% organically.
GAAP earnings before interest and taxes ("EBIT") was $654 million and the EBIT margin was 8.8%. Adjusted EBIT was $748 million and adjusted EBIT margin of 10.1% includes a 30 basis point headwind related to the divestiture of Scott Safety, foreign exchange and lead prices.
"Despite anticipated margin pressure in the quarter, we were able to deliver earnings growth. We are seeing solid traction around our efforts to increase sales capacity and gross margins on orders are beginning to improve, both of which support our confidence in delivering fiscal 2018 adjusted earnings per share guidance of $2.75 to $2.85," said George Oliver, Johnson Controls chairman & CEO.
"Additionally, we continue to strive for increased accountability and improved execution. During the quarter, we nominated two highly accomplished female executives to our Board, and more closely aligned executive compensation incentives with shareholder expectations and improved financial performance. We remain intensely focused on improving the cash generation potential of the Company, both near and long-term, while at the same time achieving our cost synergy and productivity targets," Oliver added.
U.S. Tax Reform
In connection with the passage of U.S. Tax Reform during the quarter, the Company recorded a provisionally estimated one-time net tax charge of approximately $200 million. This was comprised of a non-cash benefit of approximately $100 million, related to the remeasurement of the Company's net U.S. deferred tax liabilities and a one-time tax charge of approximately $300 million based on the preliminary estimate of income taxes on unremitted foreign earnings, payable over an 8-year period in accordance with the new legislation. The Company continues to expect a 14% adjusted effective tax rate in fiscal 2018. As certain other provisions of the new legislation become effective for the Company in fiscal 2019, the effective tax rate is expected to increase to 16 to 18%.

Sales in the first quarter of 2018 were $2.0 billion, an increase of 4% versus the prior year quarter. Excluding M&A and foreign exchange, organic sales increased 3% versus the prior year driven by growth in HVAC and Controls.
Orders in the quarter, excluding M&A and adjusted for foreign exchange, increased 4% year-over-year. Backlog at the end of the quarter of $5.3 billion was 4% higher year-over-year, excluding M&A and adjusted for foreign exchange.
Adjusted segment EBITA was $236 million, consistent with the prior year. Adjusted segment EBITA margin of 11.7% declined 50 basis points over the prior year as the benefit of cost synergies and productivity savings, as well as volume leverage, were more than offset by expected low margin backlog conversion and salesforce additions.

Start-stop battery shipments increased 20% year-over-year, led by growth in China and the Americas.
Power Solutions adjusted segment EBITA was $384 million, a 2% decline compared to the prior year, as favorable product mix and productivity benefits were more than offset by higher transportation costs and planned incremental investments.

Johnson Controls International plc Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements
Johnson Controls International plc has made statements in this communication that are forward-looking and therefore are subject to risks and uncertainties. All statements in this document other than statements of historical fact are, or could be, "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. In this communication, statements regarding Johnson Controls' future financial position, sales, costs, earnings, cash flows, other measures of results of operations, synergies and integration opportunities, capital expenditures and debt levels are forward-looking statements. Words such as "may," "will," "expect," "intend," "estimate," "anticipate," "believe," "should," "forecast," "project" or "plan" and terms of similar meaning are also generally intended to identify forward-looking statements. However, the absence of these words does not mean that a statement is not forward-looking. Johnson Controls cautions that these statements are subject to numerous important risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other factors, some of which are beyond Johnson Controls' control, that could cause Johnson Controls' actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements, including, among others, risks related to: any delay or inability of Johnson Controls to realize the expected benefits and synergies of recent portfolio transactions such as the merger with Tyco and the spin-off of Adient, changes in tax laws (including but not limited to the recently enacted Tax Cuts and Jobs Act), regulations, rates, policies or interpretations, the loss of key senior management, the tax treatment of recent portfolio transactions, significant transaction costs and/or unknown liabilities associated with such transactions, the outcome of actual or potential litigation relating to such transactions, the risk that disruptions from recent transactions will harm Johnson Controls' business, the strength of the U.S. or other economies, automotive vehicle production levels, mix and schedules, energy and commodity prices, the availability of raw materials and component products, currency exchange rates, and cancellation of or changes to commercial arrangements. A detailed discussion of risks related to Johnson Controls' business is included in the section entitled "Risk Factors" in Johnson Controls' Annual Report on Form 10-K for the 2017 year filed with the SEC on November 21, 2017, and available at www.sec.gov and www.johnsoncontrols.com under the "Investors" tab. Shareholders, potential investors and others should consider these factors in evaluating the forward-looking statements and should not place undue reliance on such statements. The forward-looking statements included in this communication are made only as of the date of this document, unless otherwise specified, and, except as required by law, Johnson Controls assumes no obligation, and disclaims any obligation, to update such statements to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of this communication.
Non-GAAP Financial Information
The Company's press release contains financial information regarding adjusted earnings per share, which is a non-GAAP performance measure. The adjusting items include mark-to-market for pension and postretirement plans, transaction/integration/separation costs, restructuring and impairment costs, nonrecurring purchase accounting impacts related to the Tyco merger, Scott Safety gain on sale and discrete tax items. Financial information regarding adjusted sales, organic sales, adjusted segment EBITA, adjusted segment EBITA margin and adjusted free cash flow are also presented, which are non-GAAP performance measures. Adjusted segment EBITA excludes special items such as transaction/integration/separation costs and nonrecurring purchase accounting impacts because these costs are not considered to be directly related to the underlying operating performance of its business units. Management believes that, when considered together with unadjusted amounts, these non-GAAP measures are useful to investors in understanding period-over-period operating results and business trends of the Company. Management may also use these metrics as guides in forecasting, budgeting and long-term planning processes and for compensation purposes. These metrics should be considered in addition to, and not as replacements for, the most comparable GAAP measure.

(1) The Company's press release contains financial information regarding adjusted net sales, adjusted segment EBITA and adjusted segment EBITA margins, which are non-GAAP performance measures. The Company's definition of adjusted segment EBITA excludes special items because these costs are not considered to be directly related to the underlying operating performance of its business units. Management believes these non-GAAP measures are useful to investors in understanding the ongoing operations and business trends of the Company.
The following is the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 reconciliation of net sales, segment EBITA and segment EBITA margin as reported to adjusted net sales, adjusted segment EBITA and adjusted segment EBITA margin (unaudited):

2. Diluted Earnings Per Share Reconciliation
The Company's press release contains financial information regarding adjusted earnings per share, which is a non-GAAP performance measure. The adjusting items include transaction/integration/separation costs, nonrecurring purchase accounting impacts related to the Tyco merger, mark-to-market gain or loss for pension and postretirement plans, Scott Safety gain on sale, restructuring and impairment costs and discrete tax items. The Company excludes these items because they are not considered to be directly related to the underlying operating performance of the Company. Management believes these non-GAAP measures are useful to investors in understanding the ongoing operations and business trends of the Company.

The Company has presented forward-looking statements regarding adjusted EPS from continuing operations, adjusted EBIT margin, organic adjusted net sales growth and adjusted free cash flow conversion (defined as adjusted free cash flow divided by adjusted net income from continuing operations attributable to JCI) for the full fiscal year of 2018, which are non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures are derived by excluding certain amounts, expenses, income or cash flows from the corresponding financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP. The determination of the amounts that are excluded from these non-GAAP financial measures are a matter of management judgment and depends upon, among other factors, the nature of the underlying expense or income amounts recognized in a given period, including but not limited to the high variability of the net mark-to-market adjustments related to pension and postretirement plans and the effect of foreign currency exchange fluctuations. Our fiscal 2018 outlook for organic adjusted net sales growth also excludes the effect of acquisitions and divestitures, and for our Power Solutions business, the impacts of lead price fluctuations. We are unable to present a quantitative reconciliation of the aforementioned forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable forward-looking GAAP financial measures because such information is not available and management cannot reliably predict all of the necessary components of such GAAP measures without unreasonable effort or expense. The unavailable information could have a significant impact on the Company's full year 2018 GAAP financial results.

4. Adjusted Free Cash Flow Reconciliation
The Company's press release contains financial information regarding free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow, which are non-GAAP performance measures. Free cash flow is defined as cash used by operating activities less capital expenditures. Adjusted free cash flow excludes special items, as included in the table below, because these cash flows are not considered to be directly related to its underlying business. Management believes these non-GAAP measures are useful to investors in understanding the strength of the Company and its ability to generate cash.
The following is the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 reconciliation of free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow (unaudited):

5. Net Debt to Capitalization
The Company provides financial information regarding net debt as a percentage of total capitalization, which is a non-GAAP performance measure. The Company believes the percentage of total net debt to total capitalization is useful to understanding the Company's financial condition as it provides a review of the extent to which the Company relies on external debt financing for its funding and is a measure of risk to its shareholders. The following is the December 31, 2017 and September 30, 2017 calculation of net debt as a percentage of total capitalization (unaudited):

6. Mark-to-Market of Pension and Postretirement Plans
The pension and postretirement mark-to-market gain or loss for each period is excluded from adjusted diluted earnings per share. There was no mark-to-market gain or loss for pension and postretirement plans for the three months ended December 31, 2017. The three months ended December 31, 2016 includes a mark-to-market gain for pension plans of $117 million due to lump sum payouts for certain U.S. pension plans in the quarter.
7. Divestitures
On March 16, 2017, the Company announced that it signed a definitive agreement to sell its Scott Safety business to 3M for approximately $2.0 billion. The transaction closed on October 4, 2017. Net cash proceeds from the transaction approximated $1.9 billion and the Company recorded a net gain of $114 million ($84 million after tax). Scott Safety is a leader in the design, manufacture and sale of high performance respiratory protection, gas and flame detection, thermal imaging and other critical products for fire services, law enforcement, industrial, oil and gas, chemical, armed forces, and homeland defense end markets. The Scott Safety business is included within assets held for sale and liabilities held for sale in the accompanying condensed consolidated statement of financial position as of September 30, 2017.
On October 31, 2016, the Company completed the spin-off of its Automotive Experience business by way of the transfer of the Automotive Experience business from JCI plc to Adient plc and the issuance of ordinary shares of Adient plc directly to holders of JCI plc ordinary shares on a pro rata basis. Following the separation, Adient plc is now an independent public company trading on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the symbol "ADNT." The Company did not retain any equity interest in Adient plc. Beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2017, Adient's historical financial results are reflected in the Company's consolidated financial statements as a discontinued operation.
8. Income Taxes
The Company's effective tax rate from continuing operations before consideration of the transaction/integration/separation costs, nonrecurring purchase accounting impacts related to the Tyco merger, mark-to-market gains or losses for pension and postretirement plans, Scott Safety gain on sale, restructuring and impairment costs and discrete tax items for the three months ending December 31, 2017 and 2016 is approximately 14 percent and 15 percent, respectively.
9. Restructuring
The three months ended December 31, 2017 include restructuring and impairment costs of $158 million related primarily to workforce reductions, plant closures and asset impairments in the Building Technologies & Solutions and Power Solutions businesses, and at Corporate. The three months ended December 31, 2016 restructuring and impairment costs of $78 million related primarily to workforce reductions, plant closures and asset impairments in the Building Technologies & Solutions business and at Corporate.
