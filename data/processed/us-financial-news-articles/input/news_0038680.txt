HOUSTON, Jan. 24, 2018 /PRNewswire/ --Prosperity Bancshares, Inc. ® (NYSE: PB), the parent company of Prosperity Bank ® (collectively, "Prosperity"), reported net income for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 of $67.138 million or $0.97 per diluted common share. Additionally, nonperforming assets remain low at 0.19% of fourth quarter average interest-earning assets. As a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act passed in December 2017, the Company was required to recalculate its deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities to account for the future impact of lower corporate tax rates and lost deductions on these assets and liabilities. The recalculation negatively impacted the Company's fourth quarter 2017 net income in the amount of $1.431 million or $0.02 per diluted common share ("Tax Act Charge"), but the reduction in corporate tax rates is expected to positively impact net income in the future. Excluding the Tax Act Charge, net income and diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter 2017 were $68.569 million and $0.99, respectively.
"Texas survived Hurricane Harvey and bounced back to robust growth of 2.6% - adding 286,000 jobs through November 2017. The unemployment rate in Texas of 3.8% is the lowest since 1970 and higher oil prices continue to improve the energy sector," said David Zalman, Prosperity's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.
"Oklahoma's economy experienced a solid recovery in 2017. The state's energy sector led the initial stages of recovery, but most other sectors also improved in 2017. The outlook in Oklahoma for 2018 is positive," added Zalman.
"On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was enacted, which reduces the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. The Act is expected to allow companies, such as Prosperity, to be more competitive, improve the lives of their employees and increase shareholder value," stated Zalman.
"At Prosperity, we communicate to our associates that they will be rewarded when the company does well. Accordingly, given the expected positive financial impact of the lower tax rate, we are pleased to announce that we will provide the following to all associates at Prosperity Bank, other than the members of Prosperity Bank's Executive Committee, whose compensation is reviewed and approved by Prosperity's Compensation Committee:
a 5% salary or pay rate increase effective March 1, 2018; and an increase in the pay rate for all hourly associates to a minimum of $11.00 per hour.
We are excited that we are able to reward our associates for the many contributions they have made to Prosperity's success," continued Zalman.
"Our customers are optimistic because of the reduced regulatory restrictions and the expected financial benefit from the reduced tax rates. In the fourth quarter 2017, loans increased 4.4% annualized, and exceeded $10 billion for the first time in Prosperity's history. Deposits at December 31, 2017 increased $913.984 million or 5.4% from $16.907 billion at September 30, 2017," added Zalman.
"We are excited going into 2018. I would like to thank all of our customers, associates, directors and shareholders for helping build a successful bank. Prosperity Bank was rated by Forbes as one of the Best Banks In America again for 2018 and we have been in the Top 10 for five consecutive years. Further, Prosperity Bank is the only Texas-based bank in the Top 10 and has been the highest ranked Texas-based bank for the past five years," concluded Zalman.

This change was primarily due to an increase in the average balance and yield on interest-earning assets, partially offset by an increase in the average rate on interest-bearing liabilities. Linked quarter net interest income before provision for credit losses decreased $97 thousand or 0.1% to $156.050 million compared with $156.147 million during the three months ended September 30, 2017.

On a linked quarter basis, the net interest margin was 3.20% compared with 3.22% for the three months ended September 30, 2017.

Noninterest expense was $81.088 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017 compared with $79.148 million for the same period in 2016, an increase of $1.940 million or 2.5%. This change was primarily due to the write-down of other real estate, partially offset by a decrease in salaries and benefits. On a linked quarter basis, noninterest expense increased $3.579 million or 4.6% compared with the three months ended September 30, 2017. This increase was primarily due to the write-down of other real estate.

The net interest margin on a tax equivalent basis for the year ended December 31, 2017 was 3.19% compared with 3.35% for the same period in 2016.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Prosperity's management uses certain non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate its performance. Specifically, Prosperity reviews tangible book value per share, return on average tangible common equity, tangible equity to tangible assets ratio and the efficiency ratio, excluding net gains and losses on the sale of assets and securities. Further, as a result of acquisitions and the related purchase accounting adjustments, Prosperity uses certain non-GAAP measures and ratios that exclude the impact of these items to evaluate its allowance for credit losses to total loans (excluding acquired loans accounted for under ASC Topics 310-20, "Receivables-Nonrefundable Fees and Other Costs" and 310-30, "Receivables-Loans and Debt Securities Acquired with Deteriorated Credit Quality"). Prosperity believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide information useful to investors in understanding Prosperity's financial results and that their presentation, together with the accompanying reconciliations, provides a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting Prosperity's business and allows investors to view performance in a manner similar to management, the entire financial services sector, bank stock analysts and bank regulators. Further, Prosperity believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information by excluding certain items that may not be indicative of its core operating earnings and business outlook. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a substitute for, nor of greater importance than, GAAP basis measures and results; Prosperity strongly encourages investors to review its consolidated financial statements in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure. Because non-GAAP financial measures are not standardized, it may not be possible to compare these financial measures with other companies' non-GAAP financial measures having the same or similar names. Please refer to the "Notes to Selected Financial Data" at the end of this Earnings Release for a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the nearest respective GAAP financial measures.

(Dollars and share amounts in thousands, except per share data)
Consolidated Financial Highlights
NOTES TO SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA
Prosperity's management uses certain non-GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) financial measures to evaluate its performance. Specifically, Prosperity reviews tangible book value per share, return on average tangible common equity, the tangible equity to tangible assets ratio and the efficiency ratio, excluding net gains and losses on the sale of assets and securities, for internal planning and forecasting purposes. In addition, due to the application of purchase accounting, Prosperity uses certain non-GAAP measures and ratios that exclude the impact of these items to evaluate its allowance for credit losses to total loans (excluding acquired loans accounted for under ASC Topics 310-20 and 310-30). Prosperity has included information below relating to these non-GAAP financial measures for the applicable periods presented.
