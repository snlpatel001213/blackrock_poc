TORONTO, Jan 17 (Reuters) - Canada’s main stock index was little changed in morning trade on Wednesday, with gains for financial stocks offset by losses among gold miners. 
* At 9:46 a.m. EST (1446 GMT), the Toronto Stock Exchange’s S&P/TSX composite index was down 1.99 points, or 0.01 percent, at 16,296.89. Seven of the index’s 10 main groups were in negative territory. 
* The materials group, which includes precious and base metals miners and fertilizer companies, lost 0.4 percent.

* The Bank of Canada on Wednesday raised interest rates, as expected, but said that while more rate hikes are probably warranted, some continued monetary policy accommodation will likely be needed to maintain optimal growth and inflation.
