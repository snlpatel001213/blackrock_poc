JOHANNESBURG, Jan 29 (Reuters) - South Africa’s biggest private education firm Curro Holdings said on Monday it had appointed deputy president Cyril Ramaphosa’s brother as an independent non-executive director. 
Douglas Ramaphosa, who has served on the boards of numerous companies and held various senior executive positions in the private sector including at Transnet and Anglo American, was appointed with effect from Jan. 26, Curro said. 
“The board welcomes Mr Ramaphosa in his new role and looks forward to his contribution to the company,” Curro, the largest for-profit independent school group in Africa with around 127 schools across South Africa and Namibia, said in a statement. 
Curro said in October it would spin-off Stadio and float it on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange in a bid to focus on pursuing growth amid “significant opportunities” in the post-school education market. (Reporting by Tanisha Heiberg; editing by Alexander Smith)
