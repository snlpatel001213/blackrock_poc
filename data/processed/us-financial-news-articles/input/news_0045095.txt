This is a winter-white classic. Known as blancmange in English, from the French blanc-manger (literally white-eat), itâ€™s very similar to Italian panna cotta: a slightly wobbly, cool and soothing pudding of milk and cream. In the recipe below, I swap in almond milk, which lends subtle nutty flavor. You may also use coconut or dairy milk, so long as you stick to full-fat. Few of us have decorative pudding tins or Jell-O molds stashed in our cabinets; if you do, this is the moment to dust them off. Otherwise, individual porcelain ramekins will do the trick and will eliminate the need to unmold the dessert.
