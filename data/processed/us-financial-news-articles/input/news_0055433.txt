In order to sell direct to the consumer at a higher margin, the Company increased its sales force in the retail piping division by 227% from 15 to 49 professionals who are strategically located in 37 cities and 16 provinces throughout China. The Pipe Network Division of Shenzhen Water Group Co., Ltd. invited ZK International to participate in drafting the product regulations and standards to be used in Phase II of the Community Pipeline Network Upgrade Program (CPNUP). The Company participated in water and gas industry exhibitions and seminars including the Gas & Heating China 2017 Exhibition and the 2017 Annual Water and Gas Academic Seminar. The Gas & Heating China 2017 Exhibition is one of the largest exhibitions for gas and heating technology and equipment, attracting more than 300 companies who participate and present their products and technology. The ZK International team presented the Company's patented products including the Double-Compression Pipe Connection Series and Integral Casted Gas Meter Connection. Both products have successfully reduced the gas leakage and installation cost for our clients due to its effective and durable structure.
On August 30, 2017, ZK International announced the closing of its initial public offering of 1,068,346 ordinary shares at a public offering price of $5.00 per share. ZK International received $5,341,730 in gross proceeds before underwriter's commission and expenses.

Mr. Jiancong Huang continued, "We are pleased to increase revenue and net income year-over-year while maintaining cash on hand of approximately $11.3 million. Our additional working capital has allowed us to make investments in the future growth of the Company, which resulted in increases in selling and marketing as well as general and administrative expenses year-over-year. This falls in line with our growth strategy."
Financial Results for the Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2017:
Record revenue for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017 totaled $44,951,740, an increase of 22.1%, as compared to $36,809,094 for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016. The increase in revenue is primarily due to the Company's increasing its market share and closing more government projects to replace aged piping infrastructure and improve local water supply systems.
Total cost of revenue was $31,843,337 for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017, as compared to $25,333,318 for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016. Total cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue increased by 2.02% to 70.84% for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017 as compared to 68.82% for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016. The increase is primarily due to increase of raw material cost and labor cost.
Selling and marketing expenses for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017 totaled $1,915,127, as compared to $957,990 for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016. Selling and marketing expenses increased primarily due to increases in advertisement expenses and compensation for the additional sales personnel we hired during the year.
General and administrative expenses for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017 totaled $1,782,318, as compared to $1,599,743 for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016. General and administrative expenses increased primarily due to the increase in administrative expenses relating to the increase in sales volume, plus increased compliance and consulting fees related to our IPO closed on September 01, 2017.
Research and development expenses for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017 totaled $1,331,111, as compared to $1,302,022 for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016. R&D expenses increased primarily due to the expenses relating to the materials and equipment we use to conduct our research for our new products.

Income tax expense totaled $995,005 for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017, compared to $1,105,440 for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016. The decrease is primarily attributable to the taxation adjustments made according to PRC Tax Law.
Net income for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017 was $5,933,688, compared to net profit of $5,302,691 for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016, an increase in profit of $630,997.
