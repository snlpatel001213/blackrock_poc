WASHINGTON — U.S. counterintelligence officials in early 2017 warned Jared Kushner, President Donald Trump’s son-in-law and senior adviser, that Wendi Deng Murdoch, a prominent Chinese-American businesswoman, could be using her close friendship with Kushner and his wife, Ivanka Trump, to further the interests of the Chinese government, according to people familiar with the matter. 
U.S. officials have also had concerns about a counterintelligence assessment that Ms. Murdoch was lobbying for a high-profile construction project funded by the Chinese government in Washington, D.C., one of these people said. 
The project, a planned $100 million Chinese garden at the National Arboretum, was deemed a national-security risk because it included a 70-foot-tall white tower that could potentially be used for surveillance, according to people familiar with the intelligence community’s deliberations over the garden. The garden was planned on one of the higher patches of land near downtown Washington, less than 5 miles from both the Capitol and the White House. 
Ms. Murdoch in 1999 married Rupert Murdoch, who is the executive chairman of News Corp NWSA, -1.05% , which publishes The Wall Street Journal and MarketWatch. Mr. Murdoch successfully filed for divorce in 2013. Ms. Murdoch still uses her married name.
