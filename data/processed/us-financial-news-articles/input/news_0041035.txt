(S&T) (NASDAQ: STBA), the holding company for S&T Bank with locations in Pennsylvania, Ohio and New York, announced today its fourth quarter and full year 2017 earnings . Fourth quarter of 2017 net income was $9.3 million and diluted earnings per share was $0.27. As a result of the December 2017 enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, additional tax expense of $13.4 million was recognized to re-measure the net deferred tax asset (DTA) in the fourth quarter of 2017. This re-measurement decreased quarterly and annual diluted earnings per share by $0.38. Excluding the net DTA re-measurement, fourth quarter of 2017 net income was $22.7 million (non-GAAP) and diluted earnings per share was $0.65 (non-GAAP). This compares to fourth quarter of 2016 net income of $17.7 million, or $0.51 per diluted share, and third quarter of 2017 net income of $22.7 million, or $0.65 per diluted share.
Net income was $73.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, with diluted earnings per share of $2.09.

Fourth Quarter of 2017 Results
Net Interest Income
Net interest income increased $0.3 million to $57.8 million compared to $57.5 million in the third quarter of 2017. Net interest margin on a fully taxable equivalent basis (FTE) (non-GAAP) declined one basis point to 3.58% compared to 3.59% in the prior quarter. The increase in net interest income is due to an increase in average loans of $49.6 million and higher short-term rates.
Asset Quality
Asset quality trends continued to be favorable during the fourth quarter of 2017. Total nonperforming loans decreased 19% to $23.9 million, or 0.42% of total loans, at December 31, 2017 compared to $29.5 million, or 0.50% of total loans, at September 30, 2017. Net charge-offs were $1.3 million, or 0.09% of average loans on an annualized basis in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to net charge-offs of $1.5 million, or 0.10% of average loans on an annualized basis, in the third quarter of 2017. As a result of improving asset quality, the provision for loan losses decreased $1.9 million to $1.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $2.9 million in the third quarter of 2017. The allowance for loan losses was $56.4 million, or 0.98% of total portfolio loans, at December 31, 2017 compared to $56.7 million, or 0.97% of total portfolio loans, at September 30, 2017.
Noninterest Income and Expense
Noninterest income decreased $0.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 to $12.7 million compared to $13.6 million in the third quarter of 2017. Securities were sold resulting in a $1.0 million loss during the fourth quarter of 2017. Bank owned life insurance decreased $0.7 million due to a claim in the third quarter of 2017. Offsetting these decreases was an increase in other income from a $1.0 million gain on the sale of a branch during the fourth quarter of 2017.
Noninterest expense increased $1.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 to $37.9 million from $36.5 million in the third quarter of 2017. Professional services and legal expenses increased $0.4 million mainly related to selling majority ownership of our insurance business that closed on January 1, 2018. Marketing expense increased $0.4 million due to normal timing of marketing campaigns. Other expense increased $0.8 million primarily due to higher loan related costs.
Financial Condition
Total assets were $7.1 billion at December 31, 2017 compared to $7.2 billion at September 30, 2017. During the fourth quarter of 2017, $41.1 million of loans and $37.8 million of deposits were sold related to a branch sale. Total portfolio loans decreased $59.3 million compared to the third quarter of 2017 primarily due to higher loan payoffs. S&T's risk-based capital ratios were relatively unchanged compared to the third quarter of 2017. All capital ratios remain significantly above the well-capitalized thresholds of federal bank regulatory agencies.
Full Year 2017 Results
Full year 2017 net income increased to $73.0 million and diluted earnings per share was $2.09. Excluding the net DTA re-measurement of $13.4 million, or $0.38 per diluted share, net income increased 21% to $86.4 million (non-GAAP) and diluted earnings per share was $2.47 (non-GAAP). Net interest income increased $22.5 million, or 11%, in 2017 due to average loan growth of $438 million, or 8.2%, and higher short-term rates. Net interest margin (FTE) (non-GAAP) increased to 3.56% compared to 3.47% for 2016. Asset quality improved throughout the year resulting in a $4.1 million decline in the provision for loan losses to $13.9 million. Nonperforming loans decreased $18.7 million, or 44%, and net loan charge-offs to average loans decreased to 0.18% compared to 0.25% in 2016.
