MADRID (Reuters) - Catalan lawmakers on Wednesday elected pro-independence politician Roger Torrent as speaker of the regional parliament in a sign of strength for parties seeking a split from Spain.
Torrent was the preferred candidate for speaker of the two main pro-independence parties Junts per Catalunya (Together for Catalonia) and Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya (Republican Left of Catalonia).
