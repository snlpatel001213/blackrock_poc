Not even Oprah’s impassioned speech could lift ratings for the Golden Globes. 
The 75th Golden Globe Awards on NBC CMCSA, -1.36% attracted 19 million viewers Sunday night, a 5% decline from last year’s 20 million viewers, according to Nielsen figures provided by the TV network. 
The telecast, which marked the first major awards event since numerous sexual harassment scandals have rocked Hollywood, averaged a 5.0 rating among adults age 18-49, down from a 5.6 rating last year. 
Still, the Golden Globes drew enough viewers to rank as the most-watched entertainment show in prime-time since the Academy Awards last February, according to NBC. Viewers tuned in not just for the awards, but to see how the entertainment industry would respond to the reckoning over sexual harassment.
