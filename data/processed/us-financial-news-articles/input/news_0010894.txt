COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Danish police said Wednesday an object found near the U.S. embassy in Copenhagen did not contain anything suspicious and they had re-opened roads around the embassy. 
Police had cordoned off the area earlier on Wednesday and it was searched by a bomb squad after a “suspicious object” was found. Reporting by Julie Astrid Thomsen and Teis Jensen; Editing by Alison Williams< larry King
