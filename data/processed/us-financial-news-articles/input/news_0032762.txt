BERLIN (Reuters) - Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Wednesday Germany needed a stable government and that she was counting on her would-be Social Democrat coalition partners to agree at a weekend congress to give the go-ahead for full-blow coalition talks.
Merkel told a news conference in Berlin she was counting on the Social Democrats to “take a responsible decision,” adding: “I will not interfere in that.”
