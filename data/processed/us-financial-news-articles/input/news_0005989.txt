“We are engaged with the U.S. administration on the issue of security cooperation and await further detail,” the Pakistani foreign ministry said in a statement following a U.S. announcement it was suspending all military assistance, believed to be at least $900 million (664.31 million pounds). 
“Arbitrary deadlines, unilateral pronouncements and shifting goalposts are counterproductive in addressing common threats,” the ministry said. Reporting by Drazen Jorgic; Editing by Robert Birsel
