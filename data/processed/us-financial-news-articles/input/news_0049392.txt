One of the most accurate Super Bowl predictors is backing up what the oddsmakers are saying: The New England Patriots will be taking home the Lombardi trophy once again. 
In its annual prediction about the big game, Electronic Arts' "Madden" game forecasts the New England Patriots will top the Philadelphia Eagles by 24-20. 
Tom Brady will once again walk away with Super Bowl MVP bragging rights, passing for 342 yards with three touchdowns and one interception, "Madden NFL 18" predicts. 
If it's any consolation to Eagles fans, "Madden" predicts it's going to be an especially tight game. 
Here's how "Madden" predicts Sunday's big game will play out: 
The Eagles will start strong, with Jay Ajayi scoring on the game's opening drive and the Patriots being contained to a field goal. The game predicts a 10-3 score at the end of the quarter. By halftime, though, the Patriots will be up 17-13, thanks to a pair of touchdown passes to Rob Gronkowski and Brandin Cooks. 
The Eagles retake the lead in the third quarter, but the game ultimately comes down to the very last play — at least in the simulation. The Patriots score again in the fourth quarter, putting them in the lead, but the Eagles are threatening late, after safety Malcolm Jennings forces New England running back Dion Lewis to fumble. Eagles quarterback Nick Foles passes to Alshon Jeffery for a potential game-winning touchdown with no time remaining — but Patriots cornerback Stephon Gilmore ruins the play for the Eagles, knocking the ball away. 
Eagles fans are already shrugging the prediction off, but Madden has been more accurate than many Vegas oddsmakers over the years. When it misses, though, it really blows it.
