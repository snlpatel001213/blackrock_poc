ACAPULCO (Reuters) - The body parts of seven people stuffed in plastic bags were found on Tuesday on a roadside in Mexico’s southern state of Guerrero, a center of opium poppy production where rival drug gangs fight turf wars over lucrative extortion and kidnapping rings.
State authorities said there were remains of six men and one woman, all unidentified, spread across 15 plastic bags in the small city of Chilapa, about 180 miles (290 km) south of Mexico City.
Guerrero is also home to the beach resort of Acapulco, one of Mexico’s most famous tourist destinations but now ranked as one of the world’s most murderous cities.
