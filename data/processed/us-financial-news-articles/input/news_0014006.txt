AMSTERDAM, Jan 10 (Reuters) - Dutch gas company NAM on Wednesday proposed halting production at six points in the Groningen gas field and lowering overall production at the field in the wake of an earthquake earlier this week. 
NAM did not specify by how much production should be cut. Final decisions on production at Groningen must be taken by the countryâ€™s energy minister. (Reporting by Bart Meijer, editing by David Evans)
