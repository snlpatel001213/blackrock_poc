LONDON (Reuters) - The Bank of England said on Thursday it was experiencing intermittent technology problems that are indirectly affecting its ability to process a limited number of transactions for wholesale counterparties.
“We have implemented workarounds to enable the Bank to operate as normal, including completing wholesale transactions in as timely a way as possible,” the central bank said in a statement. “We are working to resolve the underlying issue as quickly as we can.”
The Bank of England said the issue was not affecting the so-called real-time gross settlement or the CHAPS system, so the general public will see no impact on any of their banking services.
A central bank spokesman said the settlement day had been extended. The BoE said it would provide a further update on Friday morning.
