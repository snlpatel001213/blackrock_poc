SANTA PAULA, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Limoneira Company (the “Company” or “Limoneira”) (NASDAQ: LMNR), a leading global agribusiness with prime agricultural land and operations, real estate and water rights in California, Arizona and Chile today reported financial results for the fourth quarter ended October 31, 2017.
Fiscal Year 2017 Fourth Quarter Results
For the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017, net revenue decreased to $15.9 million compared to net revenue of $19.5 million in the fourth quarter of the previous fiscal year. Agribusiness revenue was $14.6 million, compared to $18.2 million in the fourth quarter last year, primarily due to the previously announced decrease in lemon revenues stemming from the delayed lemon harvest at its Arizona ranches that were impacted by excessive heat during the quarter and lower prices. Rental operations revenue was $1.3 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal years 2017 and 2016. There were no real estate development revenues in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017.
Agribusiness revenue for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017 includes $12.0 million in lemon sales, compared to $16.4 million of lemon sales during the same period of fiscal year 2016, with the decrease primarily the result of the aforementioned delay in the timing of the lemon harvest as well as lower prices versus the prior year period. Approximately 414,000 cartons of fresh lemons were sold during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017 at a $21.01 average price per carton compared to approximately 521,000 cartons sold at a $25.91 average price per carton during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016. As anticipated, the Company recognized minimal avocado revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017, similar to the same period last year. The Company recognized a similar amount of orange revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017 at $0.6 million, as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016. Specialty citrus and other crop revenues in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017 were $0.8 million higher than the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016 primarily due to increased wine grape harvest volume.
Total costs and expenses for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017 were $20.2 million, compared to $20.4 million in the fourth quarter of last fiscal year. The fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017 decrease in operating expenses was primarily attributable to decreases in the Company’s agribusiness costs mainly due to decreased third-party grower costs partially offset by increased packing, growing and depreciation costs and expenses. In addition, lemon packing costs were $4.1 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017 compared to $4.0 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016. For the fiscal year ended October 31, 2017, approximately 3.2 million cartons of fresh lemons were packed at an average cost per carton of $6.75 compared to 2.9 million cartons of fresh lemons packed at an average cost of $7.55.
Operating loss for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017 was $4.3 million, compared to a loss of $0.9 million in the fourth quarter of the previous fiscal year, with lower lemon revenues being the primary factor in the decrease. Net loss applicable to common stock, after preferred dividends, for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017 was $2.8 million and compares to a net loss of $0.1 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016. Net loss per diluted share for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017 was $0.19 compared to a net loss per diluted share of $0.01 for the same period of fiscal year 2016.
