Nevada gambling regulators announced Tuesday they are investigating sexual misconduct allegations involving casino mogul Steve Wynn, stemming from a Wall Street Journal investigation published last week. 
Becky Harris, chairwoman of the Nevada Gaming Control Board, one of two bodies that regulate casinos in the state, said the board will “conduct its investigation in a thorough and judicious manner.” 
The investigation comes as the Massachusetts Gaming Commission is set to meet Wednesday to discuss the allegations against Wynn, including a $7.5 million settlement paid to a manicurist who told people at the time that Wynn forced her to have sex with him. In a statement Wynn said: “The idea that I ever assaulted any woman is preposterous.” 
The Wynn Resorts WYNN, +4.84% board has also announced it plans to hire outside counsel to investigate the allegations against Wynn.
