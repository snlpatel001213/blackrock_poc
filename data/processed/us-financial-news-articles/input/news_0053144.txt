WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Former White House strategist Steve Bannon is expected to appear before the U.S. House Intelligence Committee again on Wednesday, committee members said on Monday, following up on a Jan. 16 appearance that failed to satisfy some members. 
Representative Adam Schiff, the panelâ€™s top Democrat, and Representative Mike Conaway, a senior Republican member, both said they expected to hear from Bannon again on Wednesday. Reporting by Patricia Zengerle; Editing by Tom Brown
