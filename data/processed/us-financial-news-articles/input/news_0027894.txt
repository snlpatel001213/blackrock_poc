Siam Commercial Bank slumped 3.1 percent, while PTT shed 0.8 percent. Singapore shares came off a more than 10-year high to close 0.6 percent lower, dragged by financial and real estate stocks.

Philippine shares cut early losses to close slightly lower, with financials accounting for majority of the fall.
