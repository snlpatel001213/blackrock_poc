NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- The law firm of Kirby McInerney LLP announced today that a class action lawsuit has been filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York against AMC Entertainment, Inc. (“AMC” or the “Company”) (NYSE: AMC) on behalf of investors that acquired AMC securities in the February 8, 2017 Secondary Public Offering (“SPO”) or during the period from December 20, 2016 through August 1, 2017 (the “Class Period”), seeking recovery of damages for alleged violations of the federal securities laws. Pursuant to applicable law, investors have until March 13, 2018 to apply to the Court to be appointed as lead plaintiff in the lawsuit.
On November 30, 2016, AMC acquired Odeon and UCI Cinemas Holdings, and on December 21, 2016, AMC acquired Carmike Cinemas. Also on December 21, 2016, AMC filed a shelf Registration Statement with the SEC to permit the Company to offer and sell AMC common shares. The Complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants failed to disclose that Carmike’s operations had been performing poorly.
On August 1, 2017, post-market, AMC announced worse-than-expected preliminary second quarter 2017 financial results due to a loss of market share that occurred during 2016 and the poor performance of acquired Carmike theaters.
On this news, AMC stock fell from $20.80 to close at $15.20 on August 2, 2017 (a decline of $5.60), or more than 50% below the price at which the shares were sold in the SPO.
