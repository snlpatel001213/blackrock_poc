Asian stocks extended their winning run to the 11th day on Friday, while the battered dollar won back some ground after President Donald Trump said he wanted a strong U.S. currency.

Philippine shares touched a record closing high, and posted an 1.4 percent gain for the week. Vietnam added 1 percent to reach its best closing level since March 2007, propelled by financials and utilities. Lender BIDV rose 6.9 percent to an all-time peak. Malaysian shares closed at a more than two-year high, on financials and consumer staples, and were up for a ninth straight week. The Thai index rose 0.5 percent, buoyed by gains in materials and energy stocks. Singapore fell 0.2 percent, as losses in financials offset gains in real estate stocks. DBS Group Holdings, the biggest drag on the index, was down for a second straight session.
