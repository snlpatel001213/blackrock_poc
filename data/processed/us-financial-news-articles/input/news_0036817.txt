BERLIN, Jan 22 (Reuters) - The chief executive of Germany’s Delivery Hero said on Monday consolidation was likely in the sector, helping push up further shares in the online food ordering firm after Dutch rival Takeaway.com floated the idea of a merger.
“We assume that there will be consolidation in our sector,” Delivery Hero CEO Niklas Ostberg told Reuters.
Shares in Delivery Hero were up 5.2 percent at 0839 GMT, while Takeaway.com rose 3.5 percent.
