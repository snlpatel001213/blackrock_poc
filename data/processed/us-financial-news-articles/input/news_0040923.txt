According to the lawsuit, defendants during the Class Period made materially false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) the operations of Carmike Cinemas, Inc., a company acquired by AMC, had been experiencing a prolonged period of financial underperformance due to a protracted period of underinvestment in its theaters; (2) Carmike had experienced a significant loss in market share when its loyal patrons migrated to competitors that had renovated and upgraded their theaters; (3) AMC was able to retain only a very small number of Carmike’s loyalty program members after the Carmike acquisition; (4) these issues were having a material adverse effect on Carmike’s operations and theater attendance; and (5) as a result of defendants’ statements and/or omissions, the price of AMC common shares was artificially inflated during the relevant period. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.
