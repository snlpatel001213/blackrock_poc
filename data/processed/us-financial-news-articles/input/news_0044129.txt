Omer Yurtseven’s 16 points, Allerik Freeman’s 13 points and Torin Dorn’s 12 points along with two late 3-point baskets from Braxton Beverly were keys for N.C. State (14-7, 4-4 Atlantic Coast Conference). The Wolfpack won for the first time in four road games this season.

Pittsburgh’s lead went back to 11 points, but Beverly and Freeman drained consecutive 3-pointers to close the gap to 66-65 with 3:47 left.
Two possessions later, Beverly’s trey gave the Wolfpack their first lead since the opening minutes. Beverly was 1-for-11 from long range before his two late-game 3-pointers.
The Wolfpack ended up 9-for-35 on 3-point attempts while Pittsburgh was 8-for-29.
Beverly and reserve Sam Hunt both had three 3-pointers for N.C. State, and they finished with nine points apiece.
