ATLANTA--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Floor & Decor Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: FND) (“We,” the “Company,” or “Floor & Decor”) today announced preliminary financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal 2017.
The following are the Company’s preliminary estimates as of and for the thirteen weeks ended December 28, 2017:
Comparable store sales growth is estimated to be approximately 24.4%, compared to 14.0% for the thirteen weeks ended December 29, 2016. The Company’s net sales are estimated to be approximately $387 million to $389 million, representing an increase of 39.2% to 39.9% compared to $278 million for the thirteen weeks ended December 29, 2016. The Company’s diluted earnings per share (“EPS”) is estimated to be approximately $0.43 to $0.44, representing an increase of 126.3% to 131.6% compared to $0.19 for the thirteen weeks ended December 29, 2016. Adjusted diluted EPS * is estimated to be in the range of $0.17 to $0.18, representing an increase of 54.5% to 63.6% compared to $0.11 for the thirteen weeks ended December 29, 2016. Adjusted diluted EPS is a non-GAAP financial measure. See below for a reconciliation of adjusted diluted EPS.
Tom Taylor, Chief Executive Officer, stated, “We’re very pleased with the momentum of our business, which accelerated in the fourth quarter. Comparable store sales gains in the mid-teens across much of the country, combined with post-hurricane demand primarily in Houston, led to our estimated 24.4% comparable same store sales increase. As a result, 2017 will represent our ninth consecutive year of double-digit comparable store sales growth, averaging 15% per year. We successfully opened three stores during the fourth quarter of 2017, continuing our 20% new unit growth strategy per year and our new stores continue to deliver very strong performance. We are fortunate to have great teams serving their communities well.”
Mr. Taylor continued, “While we do not expect this fourth quarter same store sales growth rate to continue at this pace throughout 2018 in part because of post-hurricane demand, we remain highly confident in the long-term momentum that is building as the Floor & Decor brand and experience becomes more known among pro customers and consumers. We enter 2018 in a strong position and remain committed to the same strategies and continued investments in our business that have made us successful for almost two decades, which we believe should result in continued long-term earnings per share growth of approximately 25% for the foreseeable future. We look forward to discussing our fourth quarter results and 2018 outlook in more detail on our year-end earnings call.”
