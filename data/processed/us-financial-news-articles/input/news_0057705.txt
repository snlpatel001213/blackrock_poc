BEIJING (Reuters) - China’s relations with Britain will not change because of changes in British-EU relations, Premier Li Keqiang said on Wednesday.
Speaking after meeting visiting British Prime Minister Theresa May in Beijing’s Great Hall of the People, Li said the two discussed upholding free trade and that China would become more open to agricultural products.
