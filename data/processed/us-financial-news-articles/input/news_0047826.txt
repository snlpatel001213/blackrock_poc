Message from Robert Dawson, President and CEO:
We are extremely pleased to report a solid Q4 to finish out FY17 with sales increasing for the fourth consecutive quarter and year-over-year. The continued increase in profitability in Q4 allowed us to produce $.04 in EPS for 2017 and overall revenue and earnings growth over 2016.
As I stated in the Q3 earnings release, our focus has been on increasing sales while maintaining the cost controls that were previously implemented. We managed to successfully do that in Q4 which resulted in improved operating margins and increased operating cash flows.
We have built significant momentum in the last several months which has helped create some very positive energy within the Company. We remain optimistic about our ability to leverage new go-to-market strategies and channel models to deliver continued profitable growth.
Subsequent to our year ended October 31, 2017, we have driven increased net sales across all divisions which has led to a significant increase in our backlog. As a result, we expect double-digit growth in net sales for the current quarter ending January 31, 2018 compared to the same period last year.
Fourth Quarter Results
Net sales for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 increased 10% to $8.9 million over the same quarter last year. Net sales at the RF Connector and Cable Assembly (RF Connector) segment increased $0.6 million, or 22%, compared to the same quarter last year while our Custom Cabling and Manufacturing (Custom Cabling) segment sales increased 4% to $5.5 million over the comparable prior year period.
Gross profit for the fourth quarter fiscal 2017 increased 37% to $2.7 million and improved to 30% of sales from 24% of sales in the same quarter last year. Selling and general expenses declined $0.3 million, or 12%, and were only 23% of sales compared to 28% of sales in the same quarter last year. Total operating expenses for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 declined by $3.1 million from the same quarter last year. Even excluding the impact of the one-time $2.8 million goodwill and intangible impairment charge that was included in fourth quarter fiscal 2016, total operating expenses in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 declined $0.3 million.
Operating income benefitted from the sales gain, improved gross margin and lower operating expenses, increasing $3.9 million to an operating profit of $0.5 million compared to an operating loss of $3.4 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. Net income for the quarter was $0.3 million, or $0.03 per diluted share, compared to a net loss of $3.0 million, or $0.34 per share.
Fiscal 2017 Results
Net sales for fiscal 2017 increased 2% to $31.0 million compared to $30.2 million in fiscal 2016. RF Connector sales increased 23%, to $11.5 million compared to $9.3 million in fiscal 2016. Although Custom Cabling sales for fiscal 2017 declined 7%, to $19.5 million in fiscal 2016, second half 2017 sales increased $1.3 million or 14% over the first half sales of $9.1 million.
The Company's overall fiscal 2017 gross margin of 28% remained relatively unchanged from fiscal 2016. However, the second half of fiscal 2017 gross margin of 29% increased nearly 3% over the first half 2017 gross margin due largely to improved sales results during the 2nd half 2017.
Overall selling and general expenses for fiscal 2017 declined 22%, or $2.1 million as compared to fiscal 2016. This reduction in operating expenses, coupled with higher sales, resulted in a $5.1 million swing in operating profit, to $0.4 million, from an operating loss of $4.7 million in fiscal 2016. Excluding the one-time goodwill and intangible impairment write-off in fiscal 2016, operating income increased $2.2 million, to $0.4 million, from an operating loss of $1.8 million in fiscal 2016. Net income for fiscal 2017 improved to $0.4 million, or $0.04 per diluted share, compared to a net loss of $4.1 million, or $0.47 per share, in fiscal 2016.

At October 31, 2017, the Company reported working capital of $13.2 million, including cash and cash equivalents of $6.0 million, a current ratio of 4.7-to-1, no outstanding debt, and stockholders' equity of $21.3 million.
