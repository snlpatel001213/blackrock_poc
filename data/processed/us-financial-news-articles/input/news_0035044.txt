PARIS (Reuters) - Airbus Helicopters delivered slightly fewer helicopters in 2017 compared to a year ago, due partly to a broader slowdown in orders in its sector.
The company, which is a division of European planemaker Airbus, said it delivered 409 helicopters in 2017 compared to 418 helicopters delivered in the previous year.
Airbus Helicopters added that its overall backlog stood at 692 helicopters as of the end of 2017.
