ABU DHABI (Reuters) - Iraqi Oil Minister Jabar al-Luaibi said on Saturday that the global oil production cut agreement between OPEC and non-OPEC producers should continue, despite a sharp rise in oil prices as the oil market still needs more time to stabilize.
Luaibi, speaking to reporters in Abu Dhabi, also said that Iraqâ€™s oil production is about 4.3 million barrels per day now.
