Shari Redstone is advocating for new blood on the board of CBS Corp. as she renews her push to merge the company with Viacom Inc., according to people familiar with the matter. 
Earlier this month, Ms. Redstone reached out to CBS Chief Executive Leslie Moonves to jump-start talks about merging CBS CBS, -1.33% and Viacom VIAB, +1.04% —potentially as soon as this quarter, the people said. 
Ms. Redstone reluctantly pulled the plug on an earlier exploration of such a combination in late 2016, but she has never stopped believing that the deal made sense, the people said. She saw the recent wave of consolidation in the media industry—particularly 21st Century Fox’s FOXA, +1.71% agreement to sell most of its assets to Walt Disney Co. DIS, +1.03% —as a clear sign that bulking up is more urgent than ever, the people said. 
“I think she has a real interest in seeing this merger move forward,” said one person familiar with her thinking.
