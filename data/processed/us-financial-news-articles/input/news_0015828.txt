The biggest U.S. lender by assets said the new tax law would help future profits by not only reducing the amount it pays the federal government but also by stimulating more business.
Shares of JP Morgan rose 1.1 percent, helping lift the S&P financial index up 0.6 percent, after its fourth-quarter profit beat estimates.
“Their effective tax rate will be declining from 30 percent to 19 percent, that’s very meaningful. It should generate more than a billion dollars flowing into the bottom line,” said Ron Weiner president and founder of RDM financial in Westport Connecticut.

The S&P consumer discretionary index jumped 0.81 percent after an increase in retail sales showed households bought more goods and figures for the prior month were revised higher, suggesting the economy exited 2017 with strong momentum.
Amazon rose 1.8 percent and provided the biggest boost to the S&P and the Nasdaq. Home Depot rose 1.6 percent and Walmart rose 1 percent.
“A lot of these companies like Target and Home Depot are getting on with the internet ecosystem of e-commerce,” said Josh Jalinski, president of Jalinski Advisory Group.
Sales at online retailers soared 1.2 percent.
Another data showed U.S. consumer prices recorded their biggest rise in 11 months in December on gains in the cost of rental accommodations and healthcare, bolstering expectations that inflation will accelerate this year.
