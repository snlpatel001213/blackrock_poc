TORONTO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Sherritt International Corporation (“Sherritt”) (TSX:S):
NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION TO UNITED STATES NEWSWIRE SERVICES OR FOR DISSEMINATION IN THE UNITED STATES
Sherritt International Corporation (“Sherritt”) (TSX:S) today announced a proposed $100 million offering of units (the “ Offering”). Each unit (a “Unit”) shall consist of one common share (a “Common Share”) and one-half of one common share purchase warrant linked to the price of cobalt (each full warrant, a “Cobalt-Linked Warrant”). Each Cobalt-Linked Warrant will be exercisable to acquire between 1.00 and 1.25 common shares of Sherritt, determined based on the Applicable Cobalt Reference Price (as defined below). The Units have been structured to provide investors with increased leverage to upwards movement in the price of cobalt.
Paradigm Capital, Eight Capital and National Bank Financial are acting as co-lead agents and joint-bookrunners on behalf of a syndicate (collectively, the “Agents”). The Offering is being made on a best efforts basis and final pricing terms will be determined in the context of the market. Sherritt has granted to the Agents an option to offer for sale units in an amount up to an additional 15% of the Offering, exercisable in whole or in part at any time until the date that is 30 days after initial closing of the Offering, at the issue price, to cover over-allotments and for market stabilization purposes. The Common Shares and Cobalt-Linked Warrants will be qualified in each Canadian province and territory by way of a prospectus supplement to Sherritt’s base shelf prospectus dated April 15, 2016. The Offering will also be made available to offshore investors pursuant to relevant prospectus or registration exemptions in accordance with applicable laws.
Each Cobalt-Linked Warrant will entitle the holder thereof to acquire that number of Common Shares that is equal to the Common Shares per Warrant Ratio (as set out in the table below). The initial Common Shares per Warrant Ratio will be one share to one warrant based on an initial Applicable Reference Cobalt Price of US$34.99 per pound or lower.
The Common Shares per Warrant Ratio will be determined and published monthly based on the Applicable Reference Cobalt Price per Pound in accordance with the following table:
Applicable Reference Cobalt Price per Pound
Common Shares per Warrant Ratio
US$34.99 or lower 1.00 US$35.00 – US$39.99 1.05 US$40.00 – US$44.99 1.10 US$45.00 – US$49.99 1.15 US$50.00 – US$54.99 1.20 US$55.00 and higher 1.25 The “Applicable Cobalt Reference Price per Pound” will be calculated and published by Sherritt monthly, based on a rolling average of the prior three months cobalt price using the midpoint of the Metal Bulletin High Price and the Metal Bulletin Low Price, 1 expressed in US dollars per pound, for each month in such three-month period. Each Cobalt-Linked Warrant will be exercisable at an exercise price to be determined in the context of the market and shall be exercisable for a period of 36 months following the closing of the Offering.
The net proceeds of the Offering shall be used to reduce Sherritt’s outstanding indebtedness, for general corporate purposes and to fund future growth initiatives. Sherritt intends to use up to $75 million of the proceeds of the Offering and its existing cash balance to repurchase a portion of one or more of its senior unsecured debentures (the “Debentures”). The Debentures will be repurchased under the terms of a modified Dutch auction tender offer (the “Tender Offer”). For further details of the Tender Offer, investors are advised to consult Sherritt’s press release dated January 16, 2018, entitled Sherritt Announces Dutch Auction to Purchase up to $75 Million of Outstanding Debentures.
