BRASILIA, Jan 29 (Reuters) - The amount of outstanding loans in Brazil rose in December from November but still fell in 2017, underscoring the credit marketâ€™s slow recovery from the deepest recession in decades.
Outstanding loans rose 0.7 percent in December to 3.086 trillion reais, capping a 0.6 percent decline in the year, the central bank said. Still, loan defaults fell 0.4 percentage point from the month before to 4.9 percent, the lowest since September 2015.
