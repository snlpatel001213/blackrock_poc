MELBOURNE, Jan 15 (Reuters) - Top-seed Rafa Nadal and world number three Grigor Dimitrov progressed to the second round of the Australian Open with easy victories on Monday while top American contenders were sent packing after shock defeats in the first round. 
World number one Nadal cruised to a 6-1 6-1 6-1 win over Dominican Republic’s Victor Estrella Burgos while Dimitrov beat Austrian Dennis Novak 6-3 6-2 6-1 to set up second round clashes against Leonardo Mayer and Mackenzie McDonald respectively. 
Nicole Gibbs was the only American to progress from the women’s draw with last year’s finalist Venus Williams, U.S. Open champion Sloane Stephens and CoCo Vandeweghe being the most notable Americans to exit on day one at Melbourne Park. 
Ryan Harrison and McDonald were the only Americans to progress to the second round of the men’s draw with seeded Jack Sock and John Isner crashing out along with surprise early exits from Croatian Borna Coric and South Africa’s Kevin Anderson. 
Despite the upsets, the competition remains tough with Caroline Wozniacki, Elina Svitolina and Jelena Ostapenko victorious in their first round matches along with top men’s players Marin Cilic, Denis Shapovalov and Nick Kyrgios. READ MORE
