LONDON (Reuters) - Britain’s main opposition Labour Party is not supporting or calling for a second referendum on EU membership, its leader Jeremy Corbyn said on Sunday.
Corbyn told ITV’s Peston on Sunday show: “We are not supporting or calling for a second referendum; what we’ve called for is a meaningful vote in parliament.”
