Former drug-company executive Alex Azar sworn in as Trump's new health-care chief 42 Mins Ago Breaking News Joshua Roberts | Reuters Alex Azar II testifies before the Senate Finance Committee on his nomination to be Health and Human Services secretary in Washington, January 9, 2018. 
Alex Azar, a former top drug-company executive, was sworn in Monday as the new secretary of the U.S. Health and Human Services Department. 
Azar, 50, is replacing President Donald Trump 's prior health-care chief, Dr. Tom Price , who resigned last fall amid controversy over his use of expensive private jet charters for official business. 
Azar, previously served as president of the U.S. division of pharmaceuticals giant Eli Lilly & Co . 
The Yale Law grad is the first drug-business veteran to lead HHS, where he had worked during the administration of President George W. Bush as general counsel, and then as deputy secretary. 
As head of HHS, will oversee an annual budget of more than $1 trillion, and the huge Medicare and Medicaid programs, which provide health coverage primarily to senior citizens and the poor, respectively. 
He also will be in charge of divisions that regulate the pharmaceuticals industry, combat diseases, and oversee implementation of the Affordable Care Act, as Obamacare is commonly known. 
The Trump administration opposes Obamacare, and has repeatedly tried to have much of it repealed. While those efforts have failed, the administration has taken a series of actions to undercut the law. CNBC NEWSLETTERS
