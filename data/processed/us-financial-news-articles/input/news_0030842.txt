ANKARA (Reuters) - The Turkish parliament on Thursday voted in favour of extending a state of emergency imposed shortly after the 2016 coup attempt for a sixth time by another three months, broadcaster CNN Turk said. 
The latest extension of the state of emergency means Turkey will have spent a year and a half under emergency rule, under which the president and government are allowed to bypass parliament in passing new laws and suspend rights and freedoms. Reporting by Tuvan Gumrukcu; Editing by Ece Toksabay
