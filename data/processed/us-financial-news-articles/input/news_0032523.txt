RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The Company recognized fourth quarter 2017 net income of $3.7 million or $0.10 per diluted common share compared to net income of $4.8 million or $0.13 per diluted common share in the fourth quarter of 2016, resulting in a return on average assets of 0.66% in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to 0.95% in the fourth quarter of 2016. Calculation of net income in accordance with GAAP includes what the Company considers “non-core” items, which are items that we do not consider indicative of our core operating performance and which are not necessarily comparable from year to year. The Company reports core earnings, which is a non-GAAP financial measure that the Company defines as GAAP net income less non-core items. The reconciliation of GAAP net income to core earnings together with related financial measures and ratios is included in the schedules accompanying this release.
