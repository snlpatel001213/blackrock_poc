FRANKFURT, Jan 25 (Reuters) - Deutsche Bankâ€™s asset management unit recorded net asset inflows of 15.8 billion euros ($19.61 billion) in 2017, recovering from heavy outflows the previous year, a bank presentation showed on Thursday.
In 2016, the unit saw nearly 40 billion euros in outflows as the bank struggled with legal fines in the U.S.
