ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkish land forces will carry out the “necessary activities” into Syria’s Afrin province on Sunday depending on developments in the region, Prime Minister Binali Yildirim said on Saturday.
Speaking to reporters hours after Turkish armed forces launched an operation against a U.S.-backed Kurdish militia in Syria’s Afrin province, Yildirim said the military had destroyed nearly all targets it identified in the region with air strikes.
