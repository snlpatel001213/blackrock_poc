KILIS, Turkey (Reuters) - The Turkish border town of Kilis was struck by a missile fired from Syria on Sunday, a Reuters witness said, the fifth cross-border missile fired in the same day.
There were no immediate reports of casualties, as Turkish ground forces pushed into northern Syriaâ€™s Afrin province after launching artillery and air strikes on a U.S.-backed Kurdish militia it aims to sweep from its border.
