Montclair, NJ , Jan. 10, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- FluoroPharma Medical Inc. (OTCQB: FPMI) today announced it completed the buyback of convertible preferred and common shares held by Platinum Long Term Growth VII, LLC, which is currently undergoing a court ordered liquidation. The preferred shares were originally issued to Platinum in a private placement in 2013.
Assuming conversion of preferred shares and notes, the repurchased shares would represent approximately 20% of the Companyâ€™s common shares outstanding on a fully diluted basis.
FluoroPharma considers this a significant development, as it will allow the company to move forward with its recapitalization efforts, which were suspended over a year ago pending the outcome of this buyback transaction. The recapitalization efforts, if successful, will allow the company to move forward in an expeditious manner to restart clinical trials for both of its molecular imaging agents, CardioPET and BFPET, which are licensed from Massachusetts General Hospital. FluoroPharma believes these novel, proprietary PET imaging agents represent a breakthrough in the assessment of acute and chronic forms of heart disease.
The Company looks forward to engaging its shareholders actively during the recapitalization process.
