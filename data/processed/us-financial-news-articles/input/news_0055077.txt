OLD GREENWICH, Conn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Ellington Residential Mortgage REIT (NYSE:EARN) (the "Company") today announced the federal income tax treatment of the distributions on the Company's common shares paid in 2017. This information is being provided to assist shareholders with tax reporting requirements related to distributions by the Company.
Shareholders should review their Forms 1099 as well as other 2017 tax statements that they will receive from their brokerage firms or other institutions to ensure that the statements agree with the information provided below. Additionally, shareholders are encouraged to consult with their own professional tax advisors with respect to their individual tax consequences.
According to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 ("the Code"), if a Real Estate Investment Trust ("REIT") declares dividends in the last three months of a calendar year, with a record date in that calendar year, but which are payable in the first month of the following year, such dividends are considered paid for the recipient's tax and Form 1099 reporting purposes on the record date and not on the payable date, to the extent of the REIT’s remaining undistributed earnings and profits (as computed for income tax purposes) as of the last day of that calendar year. The Company declared a dividend in December 2016 ("the 2016 fourth quarter dividend") that was paid in January 2017. As previously announced in January 2017, $0.2528 per share of the 2016 fourth quarter dividend is considered to have been paid and taxable to shareholders in 2017. Furthermore, $0.3069 per share of the Company’s distributions reportable on 2017 1099s is deemed to be a return of shareholder capital.
Thus, during 2017, the Company paid total distributions of $1.6000 per share, of which $1.1459 will be treated as ordinary dividends for the tax year 2017. The Federal income tax classification of the 2017 distributions as they are expected to be reported on Form 1099-DIV is set forth in the following table:
