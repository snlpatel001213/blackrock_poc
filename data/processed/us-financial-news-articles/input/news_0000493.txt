ABUJA (Reuters) - Nigeria has agreed a $550-million deal to procure two Chinese satellites and hopes to sign the contract before the end of the month, the communication minister said on Wednesday.
Adebayo Shittu said China Exim Bank and the manufacturer, China Great Walls, have agreed to pay for the new satellites after Nigeria renegotiated an earlier deal that had required it to cover 15 percent of the cost.
