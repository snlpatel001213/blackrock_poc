BERLIN (Reuters) - The German economy will probably grow by around 2.25 percent in 2018, the president of the BDI industry association said on Thursday, adding that he did not see any real risk of overheating.

These included Britain’s looming departure from the European Union and U.S. President Donald Trump’s tax reform - which slashes the U.S. corporate tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent. Kempf said that would “massively” increase tax competition.
