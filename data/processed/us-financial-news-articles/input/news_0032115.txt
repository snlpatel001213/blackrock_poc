West, 40, was born in Atlanta and raised in Chicago.
Kardashian, 37, and West are already parents to North, 4, and Saint, 2.
The “Keeping Up with the Kardashians” reality and social media star has said she decided to use a surrogate after doctors warned of serious health risks if she became pregnant again.
