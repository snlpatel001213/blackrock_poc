"[N]ews of a deal to re-open the government has predictably been offered as an excuse for yet new record highs being chalked up," but a better reason for the gains was likely the "ongoing lifting of earnings expectations by stock market analysts, driven in large by assessment of the tax deal and ... ongoing slippage in the dollar," Ray Attrill, head of foreign exchange strategy at National Australia Bank, wrote in a morning note. 
In currencies, the dollar index , which tracks the U.S. currency against six peers, was mostly steady at 90.437 at 2:58 p.m. HK/SIN.
