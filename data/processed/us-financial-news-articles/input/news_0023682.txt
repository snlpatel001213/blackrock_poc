TRENTON, N.J., Jan. 17, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- TerraCycle US Inc., the U.S. subsidiary of TerraCycle, Inc., announced that its $25 million Regulation A offering has been qualified by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), thereby allowing anyone the opportunity to invest in the innovative recycling company.
"Our mission at TerraCycle is to eliminate waste, recycle the unrecyclable and use our innovative business solutions to minimize human impact on the planet," said TerraCycle CEO Tom Szaky. "During the course of our 15-year history, we've inspired a passionate following and have been asked by those who support our mission how they can invest in the company. With the recent qualification by the SEC, any category of investor can invest in our U.S. operating company and I'm pleased to be in a position to invite the public to participate in our future."
Using third party logistics and facilities, TerraCycle converts collected waste into raw materials that are sold to manufacturers to create new products. Examples of waste streams collected and recycled by TerraCycle include chip bags, coffee capsules, cigarette butts, oral care, writing utensils and over 100 other waste streams in the United States. Through its programs, TerraCycle has shown that consumers favor businesses that provide recycling solutions for the products they manufacture.
Through the Regulation A offering, TerraCycle US Inc. seeks to use the proceeds from the offering to acquire related companies, increase staff and grow its business. Interested investors are invited to visit www.OwnTerraCycle.com to view detailed information about the offering.
Regulation A is part of the JOBS Act, bi-partisan legislation signed in 2012. The new form of Regulation A went into effect in 2015. This legislation greatly expanded entrepreneurs' access to capital, allowing them to crowdfund their capital raises and opened the door to non-accredited investors to participate in early stage investments, subject to SEC review.
