KIEV, Jan 18 (Reuters) - Ukrainian lawmakers passed a law on Thursday aimed at making the privatisation of more than 3,000 mostly loss-making state companies faster and more transparent, a step needed for Kiev to secure more aid from the International Monetary Fund.
Privatisation could bolster state coffers and bring in new foreign investors. In 2016, the governmentâ€™s first attempt at big-ticket privatisation fell through when the sale of a fertiliser plant in Odessa failed to attract any bids.
