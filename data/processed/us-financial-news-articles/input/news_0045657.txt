In a fight for the attention of 1.4 billion people in China, the country’s largest company has called in the Terminator to help.
Tencent, China’s social media and videogames giant, is planning to buy almost 10% of Skydance Media, the Hollywood studio behind movies like the Arnold Schwarzenegger vehicle “Terminator Genisys” as well as “Mission: Impossible—Fallout,” valuing it at around $1.5 billion, according to The Wall Street Journal.
