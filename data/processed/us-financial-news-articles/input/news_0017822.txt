WHEATON, Ill.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- First Trust Advisors L.P. (“First Trust”), a leading exchange-traded fund (“ETF”) provider and asset manager, announced that net assets for the First Trust US Equity Opportunities ETF (NYSE Arca: FPX) (formerly First Trust US IPO Index Fund) now exceed $1 billion. FPX is an ETF with an investment objective to seek investment results that correspond generally to the price and yield (before the fund’s fees and expenses) of the IPOX ® -100 U.S. Index (the “index”). The index measures the performance of the top U.S. companies ranked quarterly by market cap in the IPOX ® Global Composite Index (the “composite index”). The index includes the 100 largest IPOs in the composite index. The index tilts toward mid- and large-cap stocks and has historically captured approximately 85% of total market capitalization created through U.S. IPO activity, according to IPOX Schuster, LLC.
“Over the years, FPX has benefitted from its exposure to the innovation and growth of many recently issued stocks, long before they were added to traditional index funds. We believe this unique strategy’s focus on recent IPOs and spin-offs is an important key to its success,” said Ryan Issakainen, CFA, Senior Vice President, ETF Strategist at First Trust.
Since its inception on April 12, 2006, FPX has achieved an average annual total return of 11.96% based on net asset value (NAV) as of December 29, 2017, outperforming the overall U.S. equity market as measured by the S&P 500 Index and the Russell 3000 ® Index with a total return of 8.71% and 8.69%, respectively, over the same period. In addition, the fund has received an Overall Morningstar Rating TM of four stars, as of December 31, 2017, among 1,216 funds in the Large Growth category. The fund was rated 3 stars/1,216 funds (3 years), 4 stars/1,109 funds (5 years) and 5 stars/787 funds (10 years). 1
“Exposure to the IPOX 100 U.S. Index provides investors with a diversified, one stop solution to access the performance of the largest and typically best performing U.S. IPOs and spin-offs, an economically significant group of companies which often serve as a proxy for economic growth and innovation,” said Dr. Josef Schuster, CEO of IPOX Schuster LLC, the developer and sponsor of the index. “We are confident that the unique investment approach we have pioneered will continue to benefit investors seeking equity exposure outside the traditional benchmarks,” said Schuster.

ETF Characteristics
The fund lists and principally trades its shares on the NYSE Arca, Inc. There can be no assurance that an active trading market for such shares will develop or be maintained.
The fund’s return may not match the return of the IPOX®-100 U.S. Index. Securities held by the fund will generally not be bought or sold in response to market fluctuations.
Investors buying or selling fund shares on the secondary market may incur customary brokerage commissions. Market prices may differ to some degree from the net asset value of the shares. Investors who sell fund shares may receive less than the share’s net asset value. Shares may be sold throughout the day on the exchange through any brokerage account. However, unlike mutual funds, shares may only be redeemed directly from the fund by authorized participants, in very large creation/redemption units. If the fund's authorized participants are unable to proceed with creation/redemption orders and no other authorized participant is able to step forward to create or redeem, fund shares may trade at a discount to the fund's net asset value and possibly face delisting.
Risk Considerations
The fund’s shares will change in value, and you could lose money by investing in the fund. One of the principal risks of investing in the fund is market risk. Market risk is the risk that a particular stock owned by the fund, fund shares or stocks in general
