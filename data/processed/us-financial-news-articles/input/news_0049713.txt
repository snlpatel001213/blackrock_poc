The data presented below is preliminary and unaudited, based upon Sun’s estimates, and subject to further internal review by management and compilation of actual results.

While Sun expects that its results will be within these ranges and/or consistent with these estimates, actual results may differ materially from these preliminary estimates.
All of the information presented below has been prepared by and is the responsibility of Sun’s management. Its independent registered public accounting firm, Grant Thornton, LLP, has not audited, reviewed, compiled, or performed any procedures with respect to these accompanying preliminary estimates.

2017 Preliminary Estimates
Net sales $341.5 - 343.5 Net income $29.8 - 30.9 Net interest expense (income) 3.7 - 3.8 Income taxes 16.1 - 16.6 Depreciation and amortization 19.1 - 19.3 EBITDA 69.9 - 70.6 Acquisition-related amortization of inventory step-up 1.8 Acquisition and financing-related expenses 1.2 (1) Restructuring charges 1.5 (2) One-time operational items 2.9 (3) Change in fair value of contingent consideration 9.5 Adjusted EBITDA $86.9 - 87.6 Adjusted EBITDA margin 25.5 - 26.0% (1) Includes expenses associated with the Company's acquisition and financing activities to support its strategy (2) Includes charges to consolidate the Company's High Country Tek business into its Enovation Controls business (3) Includes standard costing adjustments; temporary workforce, material outsourcing, and freight charges to recover from impact of Hurricane Irma; scrap and inventory issues attributable to the carve-out of Enovation Controls from its former organization; all 2017 preliminary estimates items deemed to be one-time in the fourth quarter Adjusted consolidated operating income, adjusted consolidated operating margin, adjusted net income and adjusted EBITDA are not measures determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, commonly known as GAAP. Nevertheless, Sun Hydraulics believes that providing non-GAAP information such as adjusted consolidated operating income, adjusted consolidated operating margin, adjusted net income and adjusted EBITDA are important for investors and other readers of Sun Hydraulics’ financial statements, as they are used as analytical indicators by Sun Hydraulics’ management to better understand operating performance. Because adjusted consolidated operating income, adjusted consolidated operating margin, adjusted net income and adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP measures and are thus susceptible to varying calculations, adjusted consolidated operating income, adjusted consolidated operating margin, adjusted net income and adjusted EBITDA, as presented, may not be directly comparable to other similarly titled measures used by other companies.
Sun estimates that its federal tax rate for the 2018 fiscal year will be between 24.5% to 26.5%. However, this range is a preliminary estimate as Sun is continuing to assess the impact of the recently enacted tax law on Sun’s business and consolidated financial statements.
Sun Hydraulics expects to report its final results for the fourth quarter and full year 2017 on or around February 26, 2018.
