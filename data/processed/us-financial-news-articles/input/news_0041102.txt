MOSCOW (Reuters) - Moscow received the news about Turkish military engagement in Syria’s Afrin region with concern, the Russian Foreign Ministry said on Saturday, calling on the sides to exercise restraint.
It said Russia was sticking to its position on solving the Syrian crisis which is based on safeguarding Syria’s territorial integrity and respecting its sovereignty.
Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan said on Saturday a military operation in Syria’s Kurdish-controlled Afrin region had begun after cross-border shelling by the Turkish army.
