OSLO, Jan 4 (Reuters) - An Oslo court approved on Thursday Norwayâ€™s plans for more oil exploration in the Arctic, dismissing a lawsuit by environmentalists who said it violated a constitutional right to a healthy environment. 
The case, brought by Greenpeace and the Nature and Youth Group, had argued that a 2015 oil licensing round in the Arctic that gave awards to Statoil, Chevron and others was unconstitutional. (Reporting by Alister Doyle, editing by Terje Solsvik)
