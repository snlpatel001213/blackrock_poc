WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A Maryland man accused in a 2017 workplace shooting that left three co-workers dead at a kitchen countertop company was indicted on first-degree murder charges on Tuesday, prosecutors said. 
A Harford County grand jury indicted Radee Prince, 38, on three counts of first-degree murder and two counts of attempted first-degree murder, as well as firearms charges, for the October attack near Baltimore, county prosecutor Joseph Cassillyâ€™s office said in a statement. 
Prince is accused of shooting to death three co-workers and wounding two others at the Edgewood, Maryland, company before fleeing in a vehicle. 
A surveillance camera inside the business captured the shootings, the statement said. 
Prosecutors said Prince did not have an attorney. 
Prince, of Elkton, remains jailed in Wilmington, Delaware, for a shooting that took place there hours after the deadly attack in Maryland. He faces a charge of attempted first-degree murder stemming from the shooting of a man at an auto shop. 
Police have said Prince has a lengthy criminal record, including 15 felony convictions, and was associated with all six victims in the October shootings. Reporting by Ian Simpson in Washington; Editing by Colleen Jenkins and Andrew Hay
