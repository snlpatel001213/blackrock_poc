ALISO VIEJO, Calif., Jan. 25, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Microsemi Corporation (Nasdaq: MSCC), a leading provider of semiconductor solutions differentiated by power, security, reliability and performance, today reported unaudited results for its first quarter of fiscal year 2018 ended Dec. 31, 2017.
Net sales for Microsemi's first quarter of fiscal year 2018 were $468.7 million, up 7.6 percent from the $435.5 million reported in the first quarter of 2017.
GAAP gross margin for the first quarter of 2018 was 61.6 percent, inclusive of the effect of non-cash purchase accounting charges related to profit from acquired inventory of $5.2 million and $2.4 million in inventory charges related to the closure of a non-strategic operation. GAAP gross margin was 63.5 percent in the first quarter of 2017 and 64.0 percent in the fourth quarter of 2017.
Non-GAAP gross margin for the first quarter of 2018 was 63.2 percent, inclusive of the high-performance timing business of Vectron International, which Microsemi acquired in November 2017. Non-GAAP gross margin was 63.5 percent in the first quarter of 2017 and 64.4 percent in the fourth quarter of 2017.
GAAP operating income and net income for the first quarter of 2018 were $59.5 million and $47.9 million, respectively, and included restructuring, facility closure and other related charges of $6.4 million and acquisition-related costs of $1.4 million. Also included in net income were amortization of intangible assets of $50.3 million, stock-based compensation of $25.6 million, and debt extinguishment and other non-cash financing charges of $4.3 million. GAAP operating margin for the first quarter of 2018 was 12.7 percent compared to 12.8 percent for the first quarter of 2017 and 15.9 percent in the fourth quarter of 2017. GAAP net income was $47.9 million or $0.40 per diluted share for the first quarter of 2018 compared to $19.5 million or $0.17 per diluted share for the first quarter of 2017.
Non-GAAP operating income for the first quarter of 2018 was $150.8 million, up 13.6 percent from the $132.7 million reported in the first quarter of 2017. Non-GAAP operating margin for the first quarter of 2018 was 32.2 percent, up 170 basis points from 30.5 percent in the first quarter of 2017. Non-GAAP net income for the first quarter of 2018 was $120.1 million or $1.01 per diluted share compared to $99.8 million or $0.86 per diluted share for the first quarter of 2017.
Operating and free cash flows for the first quarter of 2018 were at $65.3 million and $55.4 million, respectively. Cash and cash equivalents at the end of the first quarter of 2018 were $166.6 million.
"We kicked off the first quarter of fiscal 2018 with 8 percent year-over-year sales growth and 17 percent EPS growth," said James J. Peterson, Microsemi's chairman and CEO. "We are on a clear path to exceed our long-term 35 percent operating margin target as we leverage customer engagements, share gains and revenue growth into industry-leading profitability."
Business Outlook
Microsemi currently expects net sales in the second quarter of fiscal year 2018 of between $477 million and $502 million, and expects non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of between $0.93 and $1.07.
Guidance on diluted earnings per share is provided only on a non-GAAP basis due to the inherent difficulty of forecasting the timing or amount of certain items that have been excluded from the forward-looking non-GAAP measures, and a reconciliation to the comparable GAAP guidance has not been provided because certain factors that are materially significant to Microsemi's ability to estimate the excluded items are not accessible or estimable on a forward-looking basis without unreasonable effort.
Microsemi regularly announces a quarterly outlook in the form of issuing a news release and does not undertake to update any of this information between such public announcements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. Please refer to the "SAFE HARBOR" STATEMENT below for risks that may affect future actual results.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures

Notes on Non-GAAP Financial Measures
To supplement the consolidated financial results prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP"), this press release and its attachments include non-GAAP financial measures which are adjusted for the items listed in the footnotes below. Management reports the following non-GAAP financial measures:
non-GAAP gross profit and gross margin; non-GAAP operating income and operating margin; non-GAAP net income and diluted earnings per share; and free cash flow.
Non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP; therefore, the information is not necessarily comparable to other companies' financial information and should be considered as a supplement to, not a substitute for, or superior to, the corresponding measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.
Management believes it is useful to provide these non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation to comparable GAAP financial measures as we believe they enhance an investor's overall understanding of our financial performance and future prospects by being more reflective of our core operational activities and more comparable with our results over various periods. By disclosing non-GAAP financial measures, management intends to provide investors with an alternate measure to evaluate and compare Microsemi's operating results and trends for the periods presented. Management uses non-GAAP financial measures internally for strategic decision making, forecasting future results and evaluating current performance. The items reconciling non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures and additional comments and the usefulness of each item are set forth below:
(1)
Manufacturing profit in acquired inventory results from purchase accounting entries to increase the value of inventory acquired to its fair value. As the acquired inventory is sold, the associated manufacturing profit in acquired inventory increases cost of goods sold and reduces gross profit. Management believes it is useful to exclude manufacturing profit in acquired inventory as it does not reflect continuing operations of acquired entities and to facilitate comparability of gross profit between periods. In addition, management excludes the impact of manufacturing profit in acquired inventory in internal measurements of gross profit.
In Microsemi's effort to streamline our product lines and strategic focus, as well as integrate product lines from acquisitions, we have periodically exited or deemphasized several areas which has improved operating expense from various cost reductions. We periodically evaluate the profitability of our various offerings. Should the actual or expected profitability fall below an acceptable threshold, we may decide to stop offering a product, in part to reallocate manufacturing, operations, engineering, sales and support resources to products we expect to generate greater returns. We believe that for many of these products, market dynamics dictate that price is the primary differentiator rather than our value-added core competencies of power, reliability, security and performance.
Restructuring, severance, facilities and other special charges consist of severance and other costs related to the consolidation of operations, strategic discontinuation of products and closure of facilities.
Related to the streamlining of our operations, we have recorded both charges and gains related to facility consolidation and equipment on both leased and owned properties and engineering equipment for development projects we are no longer pursuing. Facilities consisted of manufacturing sites, as well as sales, engineering and administrative space.
As the operations and products referred to above are not expected to have a continuing contribution to operations or they are expected to have a diminishing contribution during the transition phase, management believes excluding such items from Microsemi's operations is useful to investors as it provides a means of evaluating Microsemi's on-going operations. Management believes that utilizing non-GAAP financial measures that exclude these items is useful in providing an alternate measure to evaluate core operating activities and management excludes these items in its evaluation of operations and for strategic decision making, forecasting future results and evaluating current performance.
(2)
Amortization of acquisition related intangible assets is excluded from internal analysis of Microsemi's operations and management does not view this non-cash expense as reflective of the business' current performance. Management believes that utilizing non-GAAP financial measures that exclude this non-cash item is useful in providing an alternate measure that excludes the variability caused by purchase accounting factors.
(3)
Stock based compensation is excluded by management when evaluating operating activities and for strategic decision making, forecasting future results and evaluating current performance. Management believes that utilizing non-GAAP financial measures that exclude this non-cash item is useful in providing an alternate measure that excludes the variability caused by different methodologies and subjective assumptions used in the valuation of equity awards across different companies.
(4)
In accordance with business combination and other relevant accounting guidance, we expense acquisition and divestiture costs as incurred and recognize gains on divestitures upon consummation of the transaction. During the first quarter of 2017, we reduced the $125.5 million gain recognized from our third quarter 2016 divestitures by $1.2 million. Management excludes these expenses and gains when evaluating operating activities and for strategic decision making, forecasting future results and evaluating current performance. Management believes that utilizing non-GAAP financial measures that exclude this item is useful in providing an alternate measure that excludes the variability caused by purchase accounting factors.
(5)
Credit facility issuance and debt extinguishment costs have been excluded as they are discrete charges we incurred to issue our credit facility. Management excludes these expenses from internal measurements of credit facility interest rates and in evaluating current performance. Management believes that utilizing non-GAAP financial measures that exclude these items is useful in providing an alternate measure that is reflective of the ongoing characteristics of the amended credit facility.
(6)
These amounts represent the foreign exchange effect on non-current foreign tax liabilities recorded for possible assessments by tax authorities. Changes in foreign exchange rates are a non-cash impact to these liabilities that management excludes from internal measurements and from forecasting future results and are not viewed by management as being reflective of the business' ongoing tax position.
(7)
The tax effect of non-GAAP adjustments represents the difference in the provision for income taxes that resulted from non-GAAP adjustments to pretax income and also certain acquisition related and nondeductible stock based compensation items, and non-cash valuation allowance charges and releases related to deferred tax assets. These amounts are excluded as non-GAAP adjustments as the restructuring activities and acquisitions are not viewed by management as being reflective of the business' ongoing tax position.
(8)
Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure defined as operating cash flow less cash paid for capital expenditures. We consider free cash flow to be a liquidity measure which provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business after our capital expenditures, which can then be used for strategic opportunities including, among others, investing in Microsemi's business, making strategic acquisitions, reducing debt principal and strengthening the balance sheet. Management uses free cash flow as a supplemental measure to the net change in cash and cash equivalents as presented in Microsemi's consolidated statements of cash flows prepared in accordance with GAAP which incorporates all cash movements during the period.
