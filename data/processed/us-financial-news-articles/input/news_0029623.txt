MADRID (Reuters) - Chinese group HNA [HNAIRC.UL] said on Friday it had hired JP Morgan and Benedetto, Gartland and Co to look for possible buyers of its 29.5 percent stake in Spain’s NH Hotel Group ( NHH.MC ).
NH Hotel’s future has been uncertain since representatives of the HNA Group - its biggest shareholder - were ejected from the board in 2016 after it took over rival hotel group Carlston-Rezidor leading to accusations of a conflict of interest.
