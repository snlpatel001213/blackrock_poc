TORONTO, Jan 19 (Reuters) - Canada’s main stock index edged higher on Friday as broad-based gains offset losses for the energy group after oil prices fell.
The Toronto Stock Exchange’s S&P/TSX composite index rose 17.93 points, or 0.11 percent, to 16,302.40, shortly after the open. Eight of the index’s 10 main groups were higher. (Reporting by Fergal Smith Editing by Chizu Nomiyama)
