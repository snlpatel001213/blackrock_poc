Tropical Cyclone Ava passed through Madagascar on Jan. 5-6, hitting mostly the eastern coast of the island with wind speeds of between 140-190 kph (87-119 mph). 
The death toll had been put at about 29 people a week ago. 
The National Office of Risk and Disaster Management said in a statement on Sunday more 54,000 people were displaced by the cyclone. 
In March 2017, Cyclone Enawo killed at least 78 people on Madagascarâ€™s vanilla-producing northeastern coast. Reporting by Lovasoa Rabary; Writing by Clement Uwiringiyimana; Editing by Paul Tait
