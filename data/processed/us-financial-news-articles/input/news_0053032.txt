(Reuters) - Investors should sell their First Solar Inc ( FSLR.O ) shares and pocket the big gain the solar panel maker’s stock has made in recent months, according to a report in Barron‘s. 
First Solar stock has risen 54 percent since the end of September, when Barron’s published a story predicting U.S. tariffs on solar modules and cells, the publication said in a report in its Jan. 29 issue. 
U.S. President Donald Trump on Tuesday signed into law a 30 percent tariff on fully assembled imported solar panels as well as the cells of which they are made. 
U.S.-based First Solar is exempt from the tariff but has benefited from a surge in demand in recent months from utility customers who have wanted to fulfill their solar needs ahead of the tariff, Barron’s said. 
First Solar shares closed at $70.56 on Friday. Reporting by Suzanne Barlyn; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn
