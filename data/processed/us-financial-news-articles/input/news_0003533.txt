“It’s all a question of what will get people to sign a lease,” says Caitlin Sugrue Walter, senior director of research at the NMHC. “If 82% say they need a fitness center, then most places will have a fitness center.” 
Gyms have become a standard amenity for rental developments, with 91% of respondents living in a community with an on-site fitness center. 
The findings are no surprise to University of California, Berkeley economics professor Ulrike Malmendier. In 2006, she and her Berkeley colleague, Stefano DellaVigna, published “Paying Not to Go to the Gym,” a study that found people dramatically overestimate their future gym attendance. 
“I think the phenomenon we documented is very robust and very pervasive,” Prof. Malmendier says, noting that even though people are fairly self-aware about their lack of gym commitment, “they are often still too optimistic about how much use they will make of [fitness centers].” 
The paper, published in the American Economic Review, looked at gyms unconnected to residential developments, but Prof. Malmendier says the NMHC survey provides an interesting example of the phenomenon that study observed. 
“On the one hand, an on-site location is a really good idea in that we know that the slightest hurdle that makes it harder to go to the gym can have a huge effect,” she says. “Having it in the building is a good thing in that you want to minimize the friction.” 
“On the other hand,” Prof. Malmendier adds, “there is still some friction. You still have to go down and find the gym.” Popular Homes Based on your last search Editors' Picks
