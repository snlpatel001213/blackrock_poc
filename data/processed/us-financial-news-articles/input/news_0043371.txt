"We delivered excellent results in 2017, with the best financial and subscriber performance in many years," said Joe Natale, President and CEO. "We also reported strong financial results in the fourth quarter, including growth in revenue, adjusted operating profit and margins. Our 2018 guidance reflects accelerated growth in profit and free cash flow along with well-timed, strategic investments in our networks. We enter 2018 bullish about the growth in our core business and with a clear plan focused on enhancing our customers' experience and capturing cost efficiencies to drive sustainable growth."
Key Financial Highlights
Higher revenue
Revenue increased 3% this quarter, largely driven by Wireless service revenue growth of 7% as a result of subscriber growth and a greater number of subscribers on higher-rate plans from our various brands, including Rogers Share Everything plans.
Cable revenue increased 2% this quarter due to continued strong Internet revenue growth of 9%.
Media revenue decreased 4% this quarter primarily as a result of lower revenue from the Toronto Blue Jays, primarily due to the postseason success in 2016, and lower publishing-related revenue due to the strategic shift to digital media announced last year, partially offset by higher Sportsnet revenue and increased sales at Today's Shopping Choice (TSC).
Higher adjusted operating profit and margins
Adjusted operating profit increased 6% this quarter, primarily as a result of Wireless adjusted operating profit growth of 9% due to the strong flow-through of service revenue growth described above and various cost efficiencies.
Cable adjusted operating profit increased 3% this quarter as a result of strong Internet revenue growth, the ongoing product mix shift to higher-margin Internet services, and various cost efficiencies.
Media adjusted operating profit decreased 20% this quarter primarily as a result of lower revenue from the Toronto Blue Jays, as discussed above, and lower publishing-related revenue due to the strategic shift to digital media announced late last year, partially offset by higher Sportsnet revenue.
Our adjusted operating profit margin increased to 36.9% this quarter, an expansion of 100 basis points. This increase was primarily driven by Wireless, with a 60 basis point expansion to 43.2%, and Cable, with an 80 basis point expansion to 51.5%.
Higher net income and adjusted net income
Net income increased this quarter as a result of losses incurred last year related to the discontinuation of the development of our legacy IPTV product and higher adjusted operating profit. Adjusted net income increased 19% this quarter primarily due to higher adjusted operating profit and lower depreciation and amortization.
Substantial free cash flow affords financial flexibility
This quarter, we continued to generate substantial cash flow from operating activities and free cash flow of $1,142 million and $244 million, respectively. Free cash flow decreased as a result of greater capital expenditures this quarter compared to last year.
We ended the fourth quarter with a debt leverage ratio (adjusted net debt / adjusted operating profit) of 2.8, which improved from a ratio of 3.0 as at the end of the same period last year. See "Managing our Liquidity and Financial Resources" for more information.
Our solid financial results enabled us to continue to make investments in our network and still return substantial dividends to shareholders. We paid $247 million in dividends this quarter.

Adjusted operating profit and free cash flow are non-GAAP measures and should not be considered substitutes or alternatives for GAAP measures. These are not defined terms under IFRS and do not have standard meanings, so may not be a reliable way to compare us to other companies. See "Non-GAAP Measures" for information about these measures, including how we calculate them.

2018 Outlook
For the full-year 2018, we expect steady growth in revenue and adjusted EBITDA to drive higher free cash flow, despite higher net additions to property, plant and equipment. In 2018, we expect to have the financial flexibility to maintain our network advantages, to further reduce debt, and to continue to return cash to shareholders.
Effective January 1, 2018, the Company will commence using adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (adjusted EBITDA) as the key measure of profit for the purpose of assessing performance for each segment and to make decisions about the allocation of resources. As such, we plan to introduce adjusted EBITDA as a new non-GAAP measure in our financial reports commencing January 1, 2018. This measure will replace our existing adjusted operating profit non-GAAP measure. We believe adjusted EBITDA better reflects segment and consolidated profitability. The difference between adjusted operating profit and adjusted EBITDA is that adjusted EBITDA will include stock-based compensation expense. We also believe that our decision-making processes will not be significantly affected through the use of adjusted EBITDA. Additionally, use of this measure will change our current definition of free cash flow. For detailed reconciliations, please see "Non-GAAP Measures".

Effective January 1, 2018, free cash flow will be calculated using adjusted EBITDA as a result of our adoption of this profit measure instead of adjusted operating profit. Free cash flow presented above reflects this change. The difference between adjusted EBITDA and adjusted operating profit is that adjusted EBITDA will include stock-based compensation expense. Adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow are non-GAAP measures and should not be considered substitutes or alternatives for GAAP measures.

Effective October 1, 2017, and on a prospective basis, we reduced our Wireless postpaid subscriber base by 207,000 subscribers to remove a low-ARPU public services customer that is in the process of migrating to another service provider. We believe adjusting our base for a customer of this size that migrates off our network provides a more meaningful reflection of the underlying organic performance of our Wireless business.
3
As at end of period.
Service revenue
The 7% increase in service revenue this quarter was a result of:
higher blended ARPU, primarily as a result of the increased mix of subscribers on higher-rate plans from our various brands, which includes the customer-friendly Rogers Share Everything plans, and increased data usage. Our higher-rate plans typically generate higher ARPU, may allow users to pool and manage their data usage across multiple devices, and provide access to some of our other offerings, such as Roam Like Home, Fido Roam, Rogers NHL LIVE, Fido Data Bytes, and Spotify; and larger postpaid and prepaid subscriber bases.
The 6% increase in postpaid ARPA this quarter was primarily a result of the continued adoption of Rogers Share Everything plans and the increasing number of lines per customer account. Customers on Share Everything plans have increasingly utilized the advantages of premium offerings and access their shareable plans with multiple devices on the same account.
The 5% increase in blended ARPU this quarter was a result of the increased service revenue, as discussed above, and the adjustment to our postpaid subscriber base pertaining to the migration of a public services customer.
The increase in postpaid churn this quarter was primarily a result of heightened competitive intensity, particularly during the holiday season.
Equipment revenue
The 1% decrease in equipment revenue this quarter was a result of:
larger average investments in higher-blended-ARPU-generating customers who purchased devices under term contracts, in part due to the heightened competitive intensity this quarter; partially offset by a 7% increase in device upgrades by existing subscribers; and higher postpaid gross additions.
Operating expenses
Cost of equipment
The 11% increase in the cost of equipment this quarter was a result of:
a continued shift in the product mix of device sales towards higher-cost smartphones as more devices launched and we continue to invest in higher-blended-ARPU-generating customers; the increase in device upgrades by existing subscribers as discussed above; and higher postpaid gross additions.
Other operating expenses
Other operating expenses were stable this quarter as a result of:
various cost efficiencies and productivity initiatives; offset by higher costs related to increased revenue, as discussed above.
Adjusted operating profit
The 9% increase in adjusted operating profit this quarter was a result of the strong flow-through of service revenue growth discussed above.

Revenue
The 2% increase in revenue this quarter was a result of:
the movement of Internet customers to higher speed and usage tiers; and the impact of service pricing changes; partially offset by a lower subscriber base for our Television products.
Internet revenue
The 9% increase in Internet revenue this quarter was a result of:
general movement of customers to higher speed and usage tiers of our Internet offerings, with 54% of our residential Internet base on plans of 100 megabits per second or higher (2016 - 46%); a larger Internet subscriber base; and the impact of Internet service pricing changes; partially offset by more promotional pricing provided to subscribers.
Television revenue
The 4% decrease in Television revenue this quarter was a result of:
the decline in Television subscribers over the past year; partially offset by the impact of Television service pricing changes, net of discounts.
Phone revenue
The 10% decrease in Phone revenue this quarter was a result of the impact of pricing.
Operating expenses
Operating expenses were stable this quarter as a result of:
various cost efficiencies and productivity initiatives; offset by higher costs related to increased revenue, as discussed above.
Adjusted operating profit
The 3% increase in adjusted operating profit this quarter was a result of the revenue changes discussed above.

Revenue
The 4% increase in service revenue this quarter was a result of the increase in higher-margin, next generation on-net and near-net IP-based services revenue, partially offset by the continued decline in our legacy and off-net voice business.
We expect legacy service revenue will continue to decrease as we focus on migrating customers to more advanced, cost-effective IP-based services and solutions. Next generation services, which include our data centre operations, represented 86% of service revenue in the quarter (2016 - 82%).
Operating expenses
Operating expenses this quarter were in line with fourth quarter operating expenses of 2016.

As defined. See "Key Performance Indicators".
Wireless
The increase in additions to property, plant and equipment in Wireless this quarter was a result of investments made to upgrade our wireless network to continue delivering worry-free, reliable performance for our customers. We are augmenting our existing LTE network with 4.5G technology investments that are also designed to migrate to a 5G environment. This quarter, we began upgrading our radio infrastructure and made investments to activate the AWS-1 spectrum licence acquired earlier in 2017.
Cable
The increase in additions to property, plant and equipment in Cable this quarter was a result of higher investments in network and information technology infrastructure, partially related to our forthcoming Ignite TV product (previously referred to as the X1 IP-based video platform), and to enhance the quality of our cable network. This quarter, we began upgrading our hybrid fibre-coaxial infrastructure with additional fibre deployments and further DOCSIS technology enhancements. These deployments and enhancements will lower the number of homes passed per node and incorporate the latest technologies to help deliver more bandwidth and an even more reliable customer experience.
Business Solutions
The increase in additions to property, plant and equipment in Business Solutions this quarter was a result of higher investments in network infrastructure.
Media
The increase in additions to property, plant and equipment this quarter reflect higher investments in our broadcast infrastructure and the Rogers Centre.
Corporate
The increase in additions to property, plant and equipment in Corporate this quarter was a result of higher investments in premise improvements.
Capital intensity
Capital intensity increased this quarter as a result of higher net additions to property, plant and equipment as discussed above, partially offset by higher total revenue.

Adjusted operating profit is a non-GAAP measure and should not be considered a substitute or alternative for GAAP measures. It is not a defined term under IFRS and does not have a standard meaning, so may not be a reliable way to compare us to other companies. See "Non-GAAP Measures" for information about this measure, including how we calculate it.
Stock-based compensation
Our stock-based compensation, which includes stock options (with stock appreciation rights), restricted share units, and deferred share units, is generally driven by:
the vesting of stock options and share units; and changes in the market price of RCI Class B shares; offset by the impact of certain equity derivative instruments designed to hedge a portion of the stock price appreciation risk for our stock-based compensation programs. See "Financial Risk Management" for more information about equity derivatives.

Restructuring, acquisition and other
This quarter, we incurred $31 million (2016 - $518 million) in restructuring, acquisition and other expenses. The costs this quarter were primarily a result of severance costs associated with the targeted restructuring of our employee base and certain contract termination costs. In 2016, these costs were primarily a result of the $484 million charge for asset impairment and related onerous contracts related to our legacy IPTV product. In 2017, this charge has been reported within restructuring, acquisition and other compared to a separate classification as impairment of assets and related onerous contract charges reported in 2016.

Additions to property, plant and equipment, net
We spent $841 million this quarter on net additions to property, plant and equipment, before changes in non-cash working capital items, which was higher than the same period in 2016. See "Additions to Property, Plant and Equipment, net" for more information.
Financing activities
During the quarter, we repaid net amounts of $126 million (2016 - $335 million) on our short-term borrowings, long-term debt, and related derivatives. See "Financial Risk Management" for more information on the cash flows relating to our derivative instruments.
Short-term borrowings
Our short-term borrowings consist of amounts outstanding under our accounts receivable securitization program and under our US dollar-denominated commercial paper (US CP) program. Below is a summary of our short-term borrowings as at December 31, 2017 and 2016.

In March 2017, we entered into a US CP program that allowed us to issue up to a maximum aggregate principal amount of US$1 billion. In December 2017, we increased the maximum aggregate principal amount allowed under our US CP program to US$1.5 billion. Funds can be borrowed under this program with terms to maturity ranging from 1 to 397 days, subject to ongoing market conditions. Any issuances made under the US CP program will be issued at a discount. See "Financial Condition" for more information.
Concurrent with our US CP issuances, we entered into debt derivatives to hedge the foreign currency risk associated with the principal and interest components of the borrowings under the US CP program. See "Financial Risk Management" for more information.
Long-term debt
Our long-term debt consists of amounts outstanding under our bank credit facilities and letter of credit facilities and the senior notes and debentures we have issued. Below is a summary of the activity relating to our long-term debt for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.

Adjusted operating profit and free cash flow are non-GAAP measures and should not be considered substitutes or alternatives for GAAP measures. These are not defined terms under IFRS and do not have standard meanings, so may not be a reliable way to compare us to other companies.

Additions to property, plant and equipment, net do not include expenditures for spectrum licences.

Cash income taxes are net of refunds received.
The 38% decrease in free cash flow this quarter was a result of higher net additions to property, plant and equipment, partially offset by higher adjusted operating profit.

Financial Risk Management
This section should be read in conjunction with "Financial Risk Management" in our 2016 Annual MD&A. We use derivative instruments to manage financial risks related to our business activities. We only use derivatives to manage risk and not for speculative purposes. We also manage our exposure to both fixed and fluctuating interest rates and had fixed the interest rate on 89.5% of our outstanding debt, including short-term borrowings, as at December 31, 2017 (December 31, 2016 - 91.2%).
Debt derivatives
We use cross-currency interest exchange agreements (debt derivatives) to manage risks from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates associated with our US dollar-denominated senior notes and debentures, credit facility borrowings, and US CP borrowings. We designate the debt derivatives related to our senior notes and debentures as hedges for accounting purposes against the foreign exchange risk associated with specific debt instruments. Debt derivatives related to our credit facility and US CP borrowings have not been designated as hedges for accounting purposes.
Below is a summary of the debt derivatives we entered into and settled related to our credit facility borrowings and US CP program during the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.

As at December 31, 2017, we had nil and US$746 million of debt derivatives outstanding relating to our credit facility borrowings and US CP program (December 31, 2016 - US$150 million and nil), respectively.
Senior notes
During this quarter, we did not enter into or settle any debt derivatives related to senior notes.
Bond forwards
During this quarter, we did not enter into or settle any bond forwards.
On November 4, 2016, we exercised a $500 million notional bond forward due January 4, 2017 in relation to the issuance of the US$500 million senior notes due 2026 and paid $53 million to settle the derivative. The amount paid represents the fair value of the bond forward at the time of settlement and will be reclassified into finance costs from the hedging reserve using the effective interest rate method over the life of the US$500 million senior notes due 2026.
Expenditure derivatives

See "Mark-to-market value" for more information about our expenditure derivatives.
Equity derivatives
As at December 31, 2017, we had equity derivatives outstanding for 5.4 million (December 31, 2016 - 5.4 million) RCI Class B shares with a weighted average price of $51.44 (December 31, 2016 - $50.30).
We did not enter into or settle any equity derivatives during the quarter. We have executed extension agreements for the remaining equity derivative contracts under substantially the same terms and conditions with revised expiry dates to April 2018 (from April 2017).
See "Mark-to-market value" for more information about our equity derivatives.
Mark-to-market value
We record our derivatives using an estimated credit-adjusted, mark-to-market valuation, calculated in accordance with IFRS.

For purposes of calculating adjusted net debt and debt leverage ratio, we believe including debt derivatives valued without adjustment for credit risk is commonly used to evaluate debt leverage and for market valuation and transactional purposes.
3
Adjusted net debt and debt leverage ratio are non-GAAP measures and should not be considered substitutes or alternatives for GAAP measures. These are not defined terms under IFRS and do not have standard meanings, so may not be a reliable way to compare us to other companies. See "Non-GAAP Measures" for information about these measures, including how we calculate them.
4
Debt leverage ratio is measured using adjusted operating profit for the last twelve consecutive months.
In addition, we held $1,465 million of marketable securities in publicly-traded companies as at December 31, 2017 (December 31, 2016 - $1,047 million).
Our adjusted net debt decreased by $328 million from December 31, 2016 primarily as a result of a decrease in our outstanding long-term debt, partially offset by an increase in our short-term borrowings and reduction in the fair value of our net debt derivative asset.

If an offer is made to purchase outstanding Class A Voting shares, there is no requirement under applicable law or our constating documents that an offer be made for the outstanding Class B Non-Voting shares, and there is no other protection available to shareholders under our constating documents. If an offer is made to purchase both classes of shares, the offer for the Class A Voting shares may be made on different terms than the offer for the Class B Non-Voting shares.
Key Performance Indicators
We measure the success of our strategy using a number of key performance indicators that are defined and discussed in our 2016 Annual MD&A and this earnings release. We believe these key performance indicators allow us to appropriately measure our performance against our operating strategy as well as against the results of our peers and competitors. The following key performance indicators are not measurements in accordance with IFRS and should not be considered an alternative to net income or any other measure of performance under IFRS. They include:
Subscriber counts; Subscriber churn (churn); Postpaid average revenue per account (ARPA); Blended average revenue per user (ARPU); Capital intensity; and Total service revenue.
Non-GAAP Measures
We use the following non-GAAP measures. These are reviewed regularly by management and our Board in assessing our performance and making decisions regarding the ongoing operations of our business and its ability to generate cash flows. Some or all of these measures may also be used by investors, lending institutions, and credit rating agencies as indicators of our operating performance, of our ability to incur and service debt, and as measurements to value companies in the telecommunications sector. These are not recognized measures under GAAP and do not have standard meanings under IFRS, so may not be reliable ways to compare us to other companies.
Effective January 1, 2018, we will commence using adjusted EBITDA as the key measure of profit for the purpose of assessing performance for each segment and to make decisions about the allocation of resources. As such, we plan to introduce adjusted EBITDA as a new non-GAAP measures in our financial reports commencing January 1, 2018. This measure will replace our existing adjusted operating profit non-GAAP measure. We believe adjusted EBITDA more fully reflects segment and consolidated profitability. The difference between adjusted operating profit and adjusted EBITDA is that adjusted EBITDA will include stock-based compensation expense. We also believe that our decision-making processes will not be significantly affected through the use of adjusted EBITDA. Additionally, use of this measure will change our current definition of free cash flow.

We also use it as one component in determining short-term incentive compensation for all management employees. Adjusted operating profit:
Net income

Adjusted operating profit, adjusted net income, adjusted basic and diluted earnings per share, and free cash flow are non-GAAP measures and should not be considered substitutes or alternatives for GAAP measures. These are not defined terms under IFRS and do not have standard meanings, so may not be a reliable way to compare us to other companies. See "Non-GAAP Measures" for information about these measures, including how we calculate them.

About Forward-Looking Information
This earnings release includes "forward-looking information" and " " within the meaning of applicable securities laws (collectively, "forward-looking information"), and assumptions about, among other things, our business, operations, and financial performance and condition approved by our management on the date of this earnings release. This forward-looking information and these assumptions include, but are not limited to, statements about our objectives and strategies to achieve those objectives, and about our beliefs, plans, expectations, anticipations, estimates, or intentions.
Forward-looking information:
typically includes words like could, expect, may, anticipate, assume, believe, intend, estimate, plan, project, guidance, outlook, target, and similar expressions, although not all forward-looking information includes them; includes conclusions, forecasts, and projections that are based on our current objectives and strategies and on estimates, expectations, assumptions, and other factors, most of which are confidential and proprietary and that we believe to have been reasonable at the time they were applied but may prove to be incorrect; and was approved by our management on the date of this earnings release.
Our forward-looking information includes forecasts and projections related to the following items, some of which are non-GAAP measures (see "Non-GAAP Measures"), among others:
revenue; adjusted operating profit; additions to property, plant and equipment, net; cash income tax payments; free cash flow; dividend payments; the growth of new products and services; expected growth in subscribers and the services to which they subscribe; the cost of acquiring and retaining subscribers and deployment of new services; continued cost reductions and efficiency improvements; and all other statements that are not historical facts.
Specific forward-looking information included or incorporated in this document includes, but is not limited to, our information and statements under "2018 Outlook" relating to our 2018 consolidated guidance on revenue, adjusted EBITDA, additions to property, plant and equipment, net, and free cash flow. All other statements that are not historical facts are .
We base our conclusions, forecasts, and projections on the following factors, among others:
general economic and industry growth rates; currency exchange rates and interest rates; product pricing levels and competitive intensity; subscriber growth; pricing, usage, and churn rates; changes in government regulation; technology deployment; availability of devices; timing of new product launches; content and equipment costs; the integration of acquisitions; and industry structure and stability.
Except as otherwise indicated, this earnings release and our forward-looking information do not reflect the potential impact of any non-recurring or other special items or of any dispositions, monetizations, mergers, acquisitions, other business combinations, or other transactions that may be considered or announced or may occur after the date on which the statement containing the forward-looking information is made.
Risks and uncertainties
Actual events and results can be substantially different from what is expressed or implied by forward-looking information as a result of risks, uncertainties, and other factors, many of which are beyond our control, including, but not limited to:
regulatory changes; technological changes; economic conditions; unanticipated changes in content or equipment costs; changing conditions in the entertainment, information, and communications industries; the integration of acquisitions; litigation and tax matters; the level of competitive intensity; the emergence of new opportunities; and new interpretations and new accounting standards from accounting standards bodies.
These factors can also affect our objectives, strategies, and intentions. Many of these factors are beyond our control or our current expectations or knowledge. Should one or more of these risks, uncertainties, or other factors materialize, our objectives, strategies, or intentions change, or any other factors or assumptions underlying the forward-looking information prove incorrect, our actual results and our plans could vary significantly from what we currently foresee.
Accordingly, we warn investors to exercise caution when considering statements containing forward-looking information and caution them that it would be unreasonable to rely on such statements as creating legal rights regarding our future results or plans. We are under no obligation (and we expressly disclaim any such obligation) to update or alter any statements containing forward-looking information or the factors or assumptions underlying them, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise, except as required by law. All of the forward-looking information in this earnings release is qualified by the cautionary statements herein.
Key assumptions underlying our 2018 guidance
Our 2018 guidance ranges under "2018 Outlook" are based on many assumptions including, but not limited to, the following material assumptions for the full-year 2018:
continued intense competition in all segments in which we operate, consistent with our experience during the full-year 2017; a substantial portion of our US dollar-denominated expenditures for 2018 is hedged at an average exchange rate of $1.30/US$; key interest rates remain relatively stable throughout 2018; no significant additional legal or regulatory developments, shifts in economic conditions, or macro changes in the competitive environment affecting our business activities. We note that regulatory decisions expected during 2018 could materially alter underlying assumptions around our 2018 Wireless, Cable, and/or Media results in the current and future years, the impacts of which are currently unknown and not factored into our guidance; Wireless customers continue to adopt, and upgrade to, higher-value smartphones at similar rates in 2018 compared to 2017 and a similar proportion of customers remain on term contracts; overall wireless market penetration in Canada grows in 2018 at a similar rate as in 2017; our relative market share in Wireless and Cable is not negatively impacted by changing competitive dynamics; continued subscriber growth in Wireless and Cable Internet; a decline in Cable Television subscribers; and a relatively stable Phone subscriber base; Ignite TV launches in 2018; in Media, continued growth in sports and declines in our traditional media businesses, including our print publishing offerings; and with respect to the increase in net additions to property, plant and equipment: we continue to invest appropriately to ensure we have competitive wireless and cable networks through (i) building a 4.5G to 5G wireless network and (ii) upgrading our hybrid fibre-coaxial network to lower the number of homes passed per node, utilize the latest technologies, and deliver an even more reliable customer experience; and we continue to make expenditures related to the launch of Ignite TV in 2018.
