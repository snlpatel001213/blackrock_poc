ISTANBUL, Jan 12 (Reuters) - Turkish Deputy Prime Minister Bekir Bozdag said on Twitter on Friday the Constitutional Court had overstepped limits set out in the law with its ruling to release two journalists on the grounds their rights had been violated while in custody.
The court on Thursday ruled in favour of releasing the two journalists, jailed for more than year after the July 2016 attempted coup, on charges of links to terrorist groups and attempting to overthrow the government.
