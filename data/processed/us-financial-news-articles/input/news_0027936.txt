“Denver’s Fix for Luxury Glut: Subsidies” (U.S. News, Jan. 9) outlines how some have come to believe government is the answer to every problem. The plan to pay $500 to $900 in rent to fill vacant apartments militates against market forces. A hospital in Denver is donating $100,000 to fund the apartment rent subsidies in the hope that dozens of its employees can be helped. Apparently it never occurred to management to simply give employees a $5-an-hour raise and let the apartment and labor markets take care of this.
