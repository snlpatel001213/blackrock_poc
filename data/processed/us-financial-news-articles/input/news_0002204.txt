(Reuters) - German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s conservatives and the Social Democrats (SPD) that she hopes to win as coalition partners both said they were optimistic about upcoming talks on possibly forming a government after their leaders met on Wednesday.
“Confidence has risen and we are making an optimistic start,” the parties said in a joint statement after the party and parliamentary caucus leaders of Merkel’s Christian Democrats and her Bavarian conservative allies met with their opposite numbers from the SPD
Exploratory talks, a preliminary to full-blown coalition negotiations, are due to start on Jan. 7 and continue for four days.
