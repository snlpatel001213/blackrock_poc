BEIJING, Jan. 29, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Sohu.com Inc. (NASDAQ: SOHU), China's leading online media, video, search and gaming business group, today reported unaudited financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended December 31, 2017.
Fourth Q uarter Highlights
Total revenues were US$510 million 1 , up 24% year-over-year and down 1% quarter-over-quarter. Brand advertising revenues were US$72 million, down 27% year-over-year and 4% quarter-over-quarter. Search and search related advertising revenues were US$247 million, up 62% year-over-year and 10% quarter-over-quarter. Online game revenues were US$109 million, up 15% year-over-year and down 17% quarter-over-quarter.
Fiscal Year 2017 Highlights
Total revenues were US$1.86 billion, up 13% compared with 2016. Brand advertising revenues were US$314 million, down 30% compared with 2016. Search and search related advertising revenues were US$801 million, up 34% compared with 2016. Online game revenues were US$450 million, up 14% compared with 2016.
Dr. Charles Zhang, Chairman and CEO of Sohu.com Inc., commented, "We ended 2017 with an eventful quarter. After fourteen years of great effort, our search subsidiary Sogou finally completed a successful U.S. IPO in November. The IPO has strengthened Sogou's brand and balance sheet and should help us to further expand our market share in China's search industry while developing advanced AI capabilities. For Sohu Media Portal, we have built a stronger product development team and seen encouraging user metrics of Sohu News App. For Sohu Video, 2017 was a transformative year when we shifted our focus to original content and began to significantly cut spending on traditional TV programs. The initiative should generate meaningful cost savings and narrow the losses in our video business in 2018. On the online game side, in 2017 Changyou benefited from the launch of the mobile game Legacy TLBB and achieved solid year-over-year growth in revenue and adjusted net profit. At the same time, the business has not stopped its efforts in developing multiple new mobile games and diversifying its game portfolio."
1 On a constant currency (non-GAAP) basis, if the exchange rate in the fourth quarter of 2017 had been the same as it was in the fourth quarter of 2016, or RMB6.83=US$1.00, US$ total revenues in the fourth quarter of 2017 would have been US$493 million, or US$17 million less than GAAP total revenues, and up 20% year-over-year.
Fourth Quarter Financial Results
Revenues
Total revenues for the fourth quarter of 2017 were US$510 million, up 24% year-over-year and down 1% quarter-over-quarter.
Total online advertising revenues, which include revenues from the brand advertising and search and search-related advertising businesses, for the fourth quarter of 2017 were US$319 million, up 27% year-over-year and 6% quarter-over-quarter.
Brand advertising revenues for the fourth quarter of 2017 totaled US$72 million, down 27% year-over-year and 4% quarter-over-quarter. The year-over-year decrease was mainly due to decreases in video and real estate advertising revenues. The quarter-over-quarter decrease was mainly due to a decrease in video advertising revenues.
Search and search-related advertising revenues for the fourth quarter of 2017 were US$247 million, up 62% year-over-year and 10% quarter-over-quarter. The increases were mainly due to healthy traffic growth and improved monetization on the mobile end.
Online game revenues for the fourth quarter of 2017 were US$109 million, up 15% year-over-year and down 17% quarter-over-quarter. The year-over-year increase was due to the revenue contribution of Legacy TLBB Mobile. The quarter-over-quarter decrease was due to decreasing revenues of our existing games, including Legacy TLBB Mobile.
Gross Margin
Both GAAP and non-GAAP 2 gross margin was 46% for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared with 44% in the fourth quarter of 2016 and 49% in the third quarter of 2017.
Both GAAP and non-GAAP gross margin for the online advertising business for the fourth quarter of 2017 was 37%, compared with 33% in the fourth quarter of 2016 and 36% in the third quarter of 2017.
GAAP gross margin for the brand advertising business in the fourth quarter of 2017 was -16%, compared with 9% in the fourth quarter of 2016 and -1% in the third quarter of 2017. Non-GAAP gross margin for the brand advertising business was -17%, compared with 9% in the fourth quarter of 2016 and -1% in the third quarter of 2017. The year-over-year decrease was mainly due to a decrease in revenues of the video and media portal businesses. The quarter-over-quarter decrease was mainly due to increased video content cost. In the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company recognized impairment charges of approximately US$26 million in video content cost as a result of softer-than-expected video advertising sales.
Both GAAP and non-GAAP gross margin for the search and search-related advertising business in the fourth quarter of 2017 was 52%, compared with 48% in the fourth quarter of 2016 and 49% in the third quarter of 2017. The increases were mainly a result of slower growth in costs relative to search and search-related advertising revenues.
Both GAAP and non-GAAP gross margin for online games in the fourth quarter of 2017 was 84%, compared with 78% in the fourth quarter of 2016 and 87% in the third quarter of 2017. The year-over-year increase in gross margin was due to Legacy TLBB Mobile, which was launched in the second quarter of 2017 and has a high gross margin as revenue is recognized on a net basis after revenue-sharing with the third-party licensee operator.
2 Non-GAAP results exclude share-based compensation expense, non-cash tax benefits from excess tax deductions related to share-based awards, impairment loss recognized with respect to available-for-sale securities of an investee that is unrelated to the Company's current business operations, income/expense from the adjustment of contingent consideration previously recorded for acquisitions, dividend and deemed dividend to non-controlling preferred shareholders of Sogou, and a one-time income tax expense, offset by a one-time reduction in liability for deferred U.S. income tax, as a result of the U.S. Tax Reform. Explanation of the Company's non-GAAP financial measures and related reconciliations to GAAP financial measures are included in the accompanying "Non-GAAP Disclosure" and "Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Results of Operation Measures to the Nearest Comparable GAAP Measures."
Operating Expenses
For the fourth quarter of 2017, GAAP operating expenses totaled US$275 million, up 19% year-over-year and down 18% quarter-over-quarter. Non-GAAP operating expenses were US$255 million, up 12% year-over-year and down 22% quarter-over-quarter. The year-over-year increase was mainly due to increases in personnel expenses and share-based compensation expense due to a higher market price for the Company's common stock as of December 31, 2017. The quarter-over-quarter change was mainly due to an impairment charge related to Changyou's MoboTap business recognized in the third quarter of 2017.
Operating Loss
GAAP operating loss for the fourth quarter of 2017 was US$41 million, compared with an operating loss of US$52 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 and an operating loss of US$81 million in the third quarter of 2017.
Non-GAAP operating loss for the fourth quarter of 2017 was US$22 million, compared with an operating loss of US$49 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 and an operating loss of US$75 million in the third quarter of 2017.
Income Tax Expense
GAAP income tax expense was US$234 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared with income tax expense of US$6 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 and income tax expense of US$16 million in the third quarter of 2017. Income tax expense includes a one-time charge of US$219 million, which represents management's estimate of the amount of U.S. corporate income tax based on the deemed repatriation to the United States of accumulated Sohu earnings mandated by the new U.S. income tax law that went into effect on December 22, 2017 (the "U.S. Tax Reform"), offset by a reduction of US$4 million in liability for deferred U.S. income tax as a result of the U.S. Tax Reform. Excluding the one-time charge and one-time reduction, non-GAAP income tax expense for the fourth quarter was US$19 million. The one-time charge for deemed repatriation will be payable by Sohu over an eight-year period commencing April 2019. The actual impact of the U.S. Tax Reform on Sohu may differ from management's estimates, and management may update its judgments based on its review of future regulations or guidance issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury, and specific actions Sohu may take in the future.
Net Loss
Before deducting the share of net income pertaining to non-controlling interest, GAAP net loss for the fourth quarter of 2017 was US$270 million, compared with a net loss of US$37 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 and net loss of US$102 million in the third quarter of 2017. Before deducting the share of net income pertaining to non-controlling interest, non-GAAP net loss for the fourth quarter of 2017 was US$36 million, compared with a net loss of US$34 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 and net loss of US$90 million in the third quarter of 2017.

Non-GAAP gross margin for the search and search-related advertising business for 2017 was 49%, compared with 51% in 2016.

Both GAAP and non-GAAP gross margin for online games for 2017 was 86%, compared with 76% in 2016. The increase in gross margin was mainly due to the impact of Legacy TLBB Mobile, a mobile game launched in mid- 2017 that has a relatively high margin.

Excluding the one-time charge and one-time reduction, non-GAAP income tax expense for 2017 was US$58 million. The one-time charge for deemed repatriation will be payable by Sohu over an eight-year period commencing April 2019. The actual impact of the U.S. Tax Reform on Sohu may differ from management's estimates, and management may update its judgments based on its review of future regulations or guidance issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury, and specific actions Sohu may take in the future.

Business Outlook
For the first quarter of 2018, Sohu estimates:
Total revenues to be between US$410 million and US$435 million. Brand advertising revenues to be between US$55 million and US$60 million; this implies an annual decrease of 26% to 32% and a sequential decrease of 16% to 23%. Sogou revenues to be between US$218 million and US$228 million; this implies an annual increase of 35% to 41% and a sequential decrease of 18% to 22%. Online game revenues to be between US$90 million and US$100 million; this implies an annual increase of 5% to 17% and a sequential decrease of 9% to 18%. Before deducting the share of non-GAAP net income pertaining to non-controlling interest, non-GAAP net loss to be between US$45 million and US$55 million. Assuming no new grants of share-based awards and that the market price of our shares is unchanged; we estimate that compensation expense relating to share-based awards will be around US$6 million. Including the impact of these share-based awards, GAAP net loss before non-controlling interest to be between US$51 million and US$61 million . Non-GAAP net loss attributable to Sohu.com Inc. to be between US$65 million and US$75 million, and non-GAAP loss per fully-diluted share to be between US$1.65 and US$1.90. Including the impact of the aforementioned share-based awards, and netting off approximately US$3 million of Sohu's economic interests in Changyou and Sogou, GAAP net loss attributable to Sohu.com Inc. to be between US$68 million and US$78 million, and GAAP loss per fully-diluted share to be between US$1.75 and US$2.00.
For the first quarter 2018 guidance, the Company has adopted a presumed exchange rate of RMB6.60=US$1.00, as compared with the actual exchange rate of approximately RMB6.88=US$1.00 for the first quarter of 2017, and RMB6.61=US$1.00 for the fourth quarter of 2017.
Non-GAAP Disclosure
To supplement the unaudited consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP"), Sohu's management uses non-GAAP measures of gross profit, operating profit, net income, net income attributable to Sohu.com Inc. and diluted net income attributable to Sohu.com Inc. per share, which are adjusted from results based on GAAP to exclude the impact of the share-based awards, which consist mainly of share-based compensation expenses and non-cash tax benefits from excess tax deductions related to share-based awards, impairment loss recognized with respect to available-for-sale securities of an investee that is unrelated to the Company's current business operations, income/expense from the adjustment of contingent consideration previously recorded for acquisitions, dividend and deemed dividend to non-controlling preferred shareholders, and a one-time income tax expense, offset by a one-time reduction in liability for deferred U.S. income tax, as a result of the U.S. Tax Reform. These measures should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, but should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, GAAP results.
Sohu's management believes excluding share-based compensation expense, impairment loss recognized with respect to available-for-sale securities of an investee that is unrelated to the Company's current business operations, non-cash tax benefits from excess tax deductions related to share-based awards, income/expense from the adjustment of contingent consideration previously recorded for acquisitions, dividend and deemed dividend to non-controlling preferred shareholders, and net one-time tax expense as a result of the U.S. Tax Reform from its non-GAAP financial measure is useful for itself and investors. Further, the impact of share-based compensation expense and impairment loss recognized with respect to available-for-sale securities of an investee that is unrelated to the Company's current business operations, non-cash tax benefits from excess tax deductions related to share-based awards, income/expense from the adjustment of contingent consideration previously recorded for acquisitions, dividend and deemed dividend to non-controlling preferred shareholders, and net one-time tax expense as a result of the U.S. Tax Reform cannot be anticipated by management and business line leaders and these expenses were not built into the annual budgets and quarterly forecasts, which have been the basis for information Sohu provides to analysts and investors as guidance for future operating performance. As the impact of share-based compensation expense and impairment loss recognized with respect to available-for-sale securities of an investee that is unrelated to the Company's current business operations, non-cash tax benefits from excess tax deductions related to share-based awards, income/expense from the adjustment of contingent consideration previously recorded for acquisitions, and dividend and deemed dividend to non-controlling preferred shareholders does not involve subsequent cash outflow or is reflected in the cash flows at the equity transaction level, Sohu does not factor this impact in when evaluating and approving expenditures or when determining the allocation of its resources to its business segments. As a result, in general, the monthly financial results for internal reporting and any performance measures for commissions and bonuses are based on non-GAAP financial measures that exclude share-based compensation expense and impairment loss recognized with respect to available-for-sale securities of an investee that is unrelated to the Company's current business operations, non-cash tax benefits from excess tax deductions related to share-based awards, income/expense from the adjustment of contingent consideration previously recorded for acquisitions, and dividend and deemed dividend to non-controlling preferred shareholders, and also excluded the net one-time tax expense as a result of U.S. Tax Reform.
The non-GAAP financial measures are provided to enhance investors' overall understanding of Sohu's current financial performance and prospects for the future. A limitation of using non-GAAP gross profit, operating profit, net income, net income attributable to Sohu.com Inc. and diluted net income attributable to Sohu.com Inc. per share, excluding share-based compensation expense, non-cash tax benefits from excess tax deductions related to share-based awards, income/expense from the adjustment of contingent consideration previously recorded for acquisitions, dividend, and deemed dividend to non-controlling preferred shareholders is that the impact of share-based awards and non-cash tax benefits from excess tax deductions related to share-based awards has been and will continue to be a significant recurring expense in Sohu's business for the foreseeable future, income/expense from the adjustment of contingent consideration previously recorded for acquisitions may recur in the future, and dividend and deemed dividend to non-controlling preferred shareholders may recur when Sohu and its affiliates enter into equity transactions. In order to mitigate these limitations Sohu has provided specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from each non-GAAP measure. The accompanying tables include details on the reconciliation between the GAAP financial measures that are most directly comparable to the non-GAAP financial measures that have been presented.
Notes to Financial Information
Financial information in this press release other than the information indicated as being non-GAAP is derived from Sohu's unaudited interim financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP.

Note:
(a) In the third quarter of 2016, Changyou's management had an intention to divest Changyou's
interest in MoboTap. Therefore, the assets and liabilities of MoboTap were recognized as assets-held-for-sale
and liabilities-held-for-sale, respectively, in Changyou's financial statements for the third and fourth quarters of 2016. In the first quarter of 2017, due to the suspension of negotiations with the potential buyers of MoboTap, Changyou's management determined that the disposal was unlikely to be completed within one year. As a result, the assets-held-for-sale and liabilities-held-for-sale related to MoboTap have been reclassified as assets and liabilities in Changyou's balance sheet since March 31, 2017. In the third quarter of 2017, Changyou recognized impairment charges related to the MoboTap business.
