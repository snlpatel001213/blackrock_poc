The Serbian-born coach, who as a player was regarded as one of the game’s best-ever freekick specialists, had been in charge at the club for 18 months. 
Torino are 10th in Serie A and did not give any reasons for the unexpected decision. 
“Torino announce the release of Sinisa Mihajlovic from his post of first-team coach,” said a brief statement. “We thank Sinisa and his staff for the effort and passion he has shown in these 18 months.” 
There was no immediate comment from Mihajlovic himself. Writing by Brian Homewood in Bern,
