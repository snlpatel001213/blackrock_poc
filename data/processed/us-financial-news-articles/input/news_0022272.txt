Despite warnings of a bubble and massively fluctuating values, bitcoin continues to fascinate investors and new industries. And now the housing industry is starting to dip its toes into the water. 
One Miami condo seller is only accepting Bitcoin offers, while online real estate brokers say several other listings are willing to accept bitcoin as a payment option. (A residential/commercial property in the Isle of Man is also accepting the digital currency.) 
But how many bitcoin does it take to actually buy a house? The national median home price in November 2017 was $248,000. Using the midday price of bitcoin (as reflected on CoinDesk) on Jan. 15, that works out to 17.65 bitcoin.
