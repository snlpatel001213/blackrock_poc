Oil prices rose on Thursday, supported by unrest in Iran that has raised concerns about supply risks, a demand boost due to cold weather in the United States and OPEC-led output cuts.
U.S. oil stocks fell more than expected, continuing a steady drawdown of supplies in the world's largest oil consumer, though stocks of distillates and gasoline rose on heavy refining activity driven in part by year-end adjustments.
Anti-government protests since last week in OPEC's third-largest producer have added a geopolitical risk premium to oil prices, although Iran's production and exports have not been affected . 
U.S. crude ended Thursday's session up 38 cents at $62.01 a barrel, while Brent crude , the international benchmark, closed 23 cents higher at $68.07.
Both contracts posted their best closing price since December 2014 and touched their highest intraday level since May 2015.
