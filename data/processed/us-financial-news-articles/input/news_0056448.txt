FOLSOM, Calif., Jan. 31, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- AgreeYa Solutions —a leading global software, solutions and services company—today announced it has taken on Site Administrator for SharePoint and Recovery Manager for SharePoint from the California-based software company, Quest Software.
“We are excited to announce the latest additions to our suite of SharePoint solutions,” said Ajay Kaul, managing partner of AgreeYa Solutions. “Site Administrator and Recovery Manager are independent solutions poised to help our customers achieve the best use of their unique SharePoint environments.”
The new Site Administrator for SharePoint provides tools to understand and manage users’ entire SharePoint environment, giving IT visibility into all SharePoint servers, site collections and sites. With Site Administrator, users can utilize more than 30 reports as well as built-in global policy settings to reduce risk. Administrators can manage their infrastructure to avoid problems like poor network performance, server storage issues, security breaches and support backlogs—all from a single dashboard.
Recovery Manager for SharePoint dramatically reduces SharePoint recovery time, getting content back to users quickly and ensuring data safety. With the capability to recover both full backups and items on a more granular level, Recovery Manager performs on a non-invasive level: users do not have to go offline to restore their environment.
