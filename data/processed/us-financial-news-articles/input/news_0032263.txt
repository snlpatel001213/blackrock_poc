NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar held its modest losses against a basket of currencies on Wednesday even as the Federal Reserveâ€™s latest Beige Book showed U.S. business activity was expanding with inflation growing at a modest to moderate pace in late 2017.
At 2:08 pm (1908 GMT), the index that tracks the greenback versus the euro, yen, sterling and three other currencies was last down 0.10 percent at 90.307.
