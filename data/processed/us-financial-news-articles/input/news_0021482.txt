LONDON (Reuters) - A British parliamentary committee said on Monday it would hold an inquiry into government sourcing practices following the collapse of contractor Carillion.
“We are going to conduct a new inquiry on sourcing public services: lessons to be learned from the collapse of Carillion,” said Bernard Jenkin, chairman of the Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs Committee. He said the inquiry would be broader that just Carillion.
