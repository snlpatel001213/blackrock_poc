PLAINSBORO, N.J., Jan. 08, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Integra LifeSciences Holdings Corporation (Nasdaq:IART), a leading global medical technology company, announced today certain unaudited preliminary fourth quarter 2017 financial results.
The company expects reported revenue for the fourth quarter 2017 to be approximately $365 million, an increase of over 40% compared to $255.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. The strong results in the fourth quarter were driven by outperformance in both the Derma Sciences and Codman Neurosurgery acquisitions, as well as higher than expected organic growth, including improved performance in dural repair.
“We closed the year with strong performance in revenue and adjusted earnings per share,” said Peter Arduini, Integra’s president and chief executive officer. “This performance resulted from higher organic sales growth in both of our divisions and a faster recovery in our Puerto Rico manufacturing facility. We expect that this top-line performance will result in adjusted earnings per share above the high-end of our guidance range for the fourth quarter.”
The company is scheduled to present at the 36 th Annual J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference on Wednesday, January 10, 2018 at 3:30pm PT (6:30pm ET). A live audio webcast of the presentation will be available on the Investor section of the company’s website at www.integralife.com
The company will report its final, audited fourth quarter and full year 2017 financial results during a conference call in late February 2018. A press release with the date, time and webcast information will be provided closer to the reporting date.
