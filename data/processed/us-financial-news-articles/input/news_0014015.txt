Yildirim told a justice conference in Ankara that cases related to the July 2016 attempted putsch could be divided into two groups - those involving individuals who allegedly participated directly in the coup and those who are accused of indirect involvement. He said the former cases would be all concluded by the end of 2018. Reporting by Ece Toksabay and Tuvan Gumrukcu; Editing by David Dolan
