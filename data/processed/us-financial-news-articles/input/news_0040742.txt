CHICAGO, Jan. 23, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Lakeside Bank, a leading Chicago area independent bank, recently announced the appointment of Todd Probasco to VP, Retail Mortgage Sales Manager. The position was created to support the rapid growth of Lakeside's Mortgage Department.
Probasco will lead Lakeside's mortgage team by emphasizing Lakeside's "Personal" approach to selling mortgages. With online firms becoming increasingly more common, Probasco will feature Lakeside's hands-on mortgage bankers and "portfolio mortgage products" that can be customized for clients.
"Buying a home, whether it's your first time or your fifth, can be intimidating. Don't entrust this process to a computer screen or always different voices on the phone," said Probasco. "A personal Lakeside mortgage banker will be with you from day one through closing."
In his career, Todd has closed more than $400 million in residential mortgages. He is the proud winner of the 2005 Illinois Mortgage Broker/Owner of the Year Award and # 1 Producer in 2016 for the Chicago 1st Time Home Buyer Assistance Program.
