LONDON, Jan 15 (Reuters) - British construction and services company Carillion collapsed on Monday when its lenders refused to provide any further financial support.
The company, which employs 43,000 people to provide services in defence, education, health and transport, said the government would provide the necessary funding to maintain the public services carried out by its staff. (Reporting by Kate Holton; editing by Guy Faulconbridge)
