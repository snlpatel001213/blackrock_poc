WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan said on Tuesday he had faith in the job Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein was doing at the Justice Department, when asked about reports President Donald Trump was considering firing him.
“I think Rod Rosenstein is doing a fine job. I have no reason to see why he should do that,” Ryan told reporters.
