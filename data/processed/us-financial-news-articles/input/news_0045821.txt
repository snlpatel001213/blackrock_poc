Capitala Finance Corporation is a business development company that invests primarily in first and second liens, subordinated debt and, to a lesser extent, equity securities issued by lower and traditional middle-market companies.
Capitala Investment Advisors, LLC ("Capitala Investment Advisors") manages the Company's investment activities. The Company's Board of Directors supervises the Company's investment activities. The Company's executive officers are part of Capitala Investment Advisors' management team.
Under the Company's investment advisory agreement with Capitala Investment Advisors (the "Investment Advisory Agreement"), the Company pays Capitala Investment Advisors an annual base management fee based on the Company's gross assets as well as an incentive fee based on the Company's performance.
On January 4, 2016, the Company announced that Capitala Investment Advisors agreed to voluntarily waive its quarterly incentive fee.
The Complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company's business, operational and compliance policies. Specifically, Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) Capitala Investment Advisors had been losing professional talent in both underwriting and portfolio management due to the waiving of its incentive fee; (ii) such loss of talent negatively impacted the quality of the Company's investment portfolio; and (iii) as a result, Capitala's public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times.
On August 7, 2017, the Company revealed during aftermarket hours that six of its investments were on non-accrual statusâ€”twice as many as in the previous quarter.
On August 8, 2017, the Company's Chief Executive Officer Joseph B. Alala III revealed that Capitala Investment Advisors had been losing professional talent in underwriting and portfolio management since waiving its incentive fee, which resulted in a rising number of nonaccrual investments.
On this news, shares of the Company fell $3.82 per share, or approximately 30%, over the next three trading days to close at $8.99 per share on August 10, 2017, damaging investors.
