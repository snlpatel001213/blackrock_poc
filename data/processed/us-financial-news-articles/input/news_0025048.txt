SEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Washington Federal, Inc. (Nasdaq: WAFD) (the "Company"), parent company of Washington Federal, National Association, today announced quarterly earnings of $51,670,000 or $0.59 per diluted share for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 compared to $41,246,000 or $0.46 per diluted share for the quarter ended December 31, 2016, a $0.13 or 28% increase in fully diluted earnings per share. Return on equity for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 was 10.25% compared to 8.31% for the quarter ended December 31, 2016. Return on assets for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 was 1.35% compared to 1.11% for the same quarter in the prior year.
During the quarter, the Company had two unusual events occur that impacted our financial results. First, as a result of the new tax legislation commonly known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Act”), tax expense for the quarter was $9.0 million. Excluding the effects of the Act, tax expense for the quarter would have been $18.0 million, or higher by $9.0 million. Second, during the quarter the Company made the decision to pursue termination of its loss share agreements with the FDIC related to two acquisitions, one in 2010 and one in 2012. Because of this decision, a charge of $8.6 million was recorded in this quarter’s results. Additional information on both of these items is included in the paragraphs below.
President and Chief Executive Officer Brent J. Beardall commented, “As a result of the changes in the tax law there are several unusual items in this quarter's results. Looking beyond those items, we are particularly pleased with the continued improvement in our core banking operations. Excluding the FDIC charge, this quarter produced a record $69.2 million of pre-tax income. As we have previously announced, the tax law reduces the advantage of credit unions and other non-tax paying competitors. It also allows the Company to further boost investments in its people, technology and communities while continuing to perform well for our shareholders. Challenges remain as we make improvements to our client facing systems and enhance our Bank Secrecy Act Program, but we are excited about the momentum we have and future opportunities.”
Total assets were $15.6 billion as of December 31, 2017 compared to $15.3 billion as of September 30, 2017. Asset growth since September 30, 2017 resulted primarily from a $224 million increase in net loans receivable and a $119 million increase in held-to-maturity securities.
Customer deposits increased by $167 million or 1.5% since September 30, 2017 and totaled $11.0 billion as of December 31, 2017. Transaction accounts increased by $121 million or 1.9% during that period, while time deposits increased $45 million or 1.0%. The mix of customer deposits has continued to shift over the last several years as the Company focuses on growing transaction accounts to lessen sensitivity to rising interest rates and reduce interest expense. As of December 31, 2017, 58.9% of the Company’s deposits were in transaction accounts. Core deposits, defined as all transaction accounts and time deposits less than $250,000, totaled 94.0% of deposits at December 31, 2017.
Borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank ("FHLB") totaled $2.4 billion as of December 31, 2017 and $2.2 billion at September 30, 2017. The weighted average rate for FHLB borrowings was 2.56% as of December 31, 2017 and 2.80% at September 30, 2017, the decline being due to the maturity of some long-term FHLB advances.
Loan originations totaled $954 million for our first fiscal quarter 2018 compared to $1.2 billion of originations in the same quarter one year ago. Partially offsetting loan originations in each of these respective quarters were loan repayments of $860 million and $896 million. Commercial loans represented 70% of all loan originations during our first fiscal quarter 2018 with consumer loans accounting for the remaining 30%. The Company views organic loan growth as the highest and best use of its capital and prefers commercial loans in this low rate environment due to the fact they generally have floating interest rates and shorter durations. The weighted average interest rate on loans was 4.30% as of December 31, 2017, an increase from 4.28% as of September 30, 2017.
Asset quality remained strong and the ratio of non-performing assets to total assets improved to 0.41% as of December 31, 2017 compared to 0.56% at December 31, 2016 and 0.46% at September 30, 2017. Since September 30, 2017, real estate owned decreased by $3 million, or 13%, and non-accrual loans decreased by $4 million, or 8%. Delinquent loans were 0.43% of total loans at December 31, 2017 compared to 0.74% at December 31, 2016 and 0.40% at September 30, 2017. The allowance for loan losses and reserve for unfunded commitments totaled $134 million as of December 31, 2017 and was 1.08% of gross loans outstanding, as compared to $131 million or 1.07% of gross loans outstanding at September 30, 2017. The slight increase in the ratio of the total allowance and reserve to gross loans since the Company's fiscal year end reflects continued improvement in credit conditions offset by the continued shift in the loan portfolio mix to include a greater proportion of commercial loans outstanding, which generally require a higher level of reserves.
On November 20, 2017, the Company paid a regular cash dividend of $0.15 per share, which represented the 139th consecutive quarterly cash dividend. During the quarter, the Company repurchased 1,147,370 shares of common stock at a weighted average price of $33.98 per share and has authorization to repurchase approximately 754 thousand additional shares. The Company varies the pace of share repurchases depending on several factors, including share price, lending opportunities and capital levels. Since September 30, 2017, tangible common stockholders’ equity per share increased by $0.09 or 0.5% to $19.67 and the ratio of tangible common equity to tangible assets remained strong at 11.12% as of December 31, 2017.
Net interest income was $116 million for the quarter, an increase of $12.6 million or 12.2% from the same quarter in the prior year. The increase in net interest income from the prior year was primarily due to both higher balances and yield. Average earning assets increased by $513 million, or 3.8%. Net interest margin increased to 3.26% in the first fiscal quarter of 2018 from 3.02% for the same quarter in the prior year. The margin increase is primarily due to changes in the mix of interest earning assets, including higher yields on variable rate loans, cash and investments, as well as a lower rate on FHLB advances due to the maturity of some higher cost long-term advances.
The Company did not record any provision for loan losses in the first fiscal quarter of 2018 or 2017 as net recoveries and improvement in credit conditions were offset by strong growth in the loan portfolio. Net recoveries were $3.1 million for the first fiscal quarter of 2018 compared to $5.3 million for the prior year's quarter.
Total other income was $6.8 million for the first fiscal quarter of 2018, a decrease of $5.1
