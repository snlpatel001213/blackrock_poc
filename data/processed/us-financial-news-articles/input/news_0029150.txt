BRUSSELS, Jan 18 (Reuters) - EU antitrust regulators have approved U.S. smartphone chipmaker Qualcommâ€™s planned $38 billion acquisition of NXP Semiconductors subject to a series of commitments Qualcomm has made.
The European Commission, which oversees competition policy in the European Union, said it had identified a number of competition concerns that led to an in-depth investigation.
However, it said on Thursday that it had approved the deal on condition that Qualcomm fulfilled its commitments. (Reporting by Philip Blenkinsop)
