LONDON (Reuters) - Former racer Alberto Puig has been appointed manager of MotoGP champions Repsol Honda following the departure of Livio Suppo last year.
The 50-year-old Spaniard was a race winner in 500cc, the category that became MotoGP, with Honda in 1995 at his home grand prix.
Italian Suppo announced his departure in November, a day after Repsol Hondaâ€™s Spaniard Marc Marquez secured his fourth top-flight world championship in five years.
