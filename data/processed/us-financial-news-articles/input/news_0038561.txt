(Reuters) - The U.S. Commerce Department on Tuesday said its Advance Economic Indicators report would be delayed until Friday as a result of the government shutdown that occurred earlier this week.
The report will be released at the usual time of 8:30 a.m. EST (1330 GMT). It was originally scheduled for release on Thursday.
