BUENOS AIRES, Jan 16 (Reuters) - Argentinaâ€™s central bank cut interest rates to 27.24 percent from 28.75 percent on its short-term securities on Tuesday in its monthly auction, a move that was in line with market expectations after a recent change in inflation goals.
The monetary authority sold 352.804 billion pesos ($18.667 billion) in Lebac securities.
