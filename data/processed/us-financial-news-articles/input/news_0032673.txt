ISTANBUL (Reuters) - A Turkish military operation over Syriaâ€™s Afrin region aims to liberate it from the control of Kurdish militants from the YPG and PYD groups, a senior Turkish official told Reuters.
Freeing nearby Manbij from militant control will follow the operation to Afrin, the source said, adding that the operations are aimed at re-building social and economic infrastructure in the region.
