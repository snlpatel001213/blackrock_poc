(Reuters) - France have recalled scrumhalf Morgan Parra with head coach Jacques Brunel also naming six uncapped players in a 32-man squad for the Six Nations, which starts next month. 
Parra, 29, last played for his country in October 2015 and did not feature under former France coach Guy Noves, who was sacked in December following a poor run of results. 
Bordeaux flyhalf Matthieu Jalibert received his first call-up while uncapped Danny Priso, Cedate Gomes Sa, Felix Lambey, Marco Tauleign and Geoffrey Palis were also chosen. 
Veterans Francois Trinh-Duc and Louis Picamoles are the most notable absentees in Brunel’s squad. 
Toulon centre Mathieu Bastareaud has been included despite a possible ban that could rule him out of the Six Nations after being cited for homophobic comments made during last Sunday’s European Champions Cup win over Italy’s Benetton Treviso. 
Bastareaud’s disciplinary hearing is expected to conclude later on Wednesday. 
France start their Six Nations campaign against Ireland on Feb. 3 with the competition ending on March 17.
