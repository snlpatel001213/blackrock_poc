MELBOURNE, Jan 15 (Reuters) - A look at the records of American Venus Williams and Switzerlandâ€™s Belinda Bencic before their first round match at the Australian Open on Monday (prefix number denotes seeding). 5-VENUS WILLIAMS 
WTA ranking: 5; (Highest ranking: 1)

Venus reached her first grand slam final in eight years at Melbourne Park last year, losing to younger sister Serena. Hard-hitting fifth seed Venus remains a formidable opponent when on song and will be tough to beat if she makes a run into the second week. BELINDA BENCIC

Unseeded Bencic heads into the Australian Open on the back of strong displays in a successful Hopman Cup campaign for Switzerland where she partnered Roger Federer. The plucky right-hander ended last season on a 15-match winning streak, claiming three ITF titles to get back into the top 100 and could prove a difficult early challenge for Williams.
