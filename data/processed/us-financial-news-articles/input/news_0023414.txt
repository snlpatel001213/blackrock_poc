 20 AM / in 26 minutes China regulator issues new rules on derivative products   
BEIJING, Jan 16 (Reuters) - China’s banking regulator issued new rules on Tuesday to contain counterparty default risks for derivative products. 
Policymakers in the world’s second-largest economy have been trying to contain financial risks and slow an explosive build-up in debt without stunting economic growth. 
The new rules will take effect from Jan. 1, 2019, according to a statement published on the website of the China Banking Regulatory Commission. (Reporting by Beijing Monitoring Desk; Editing by Jacqueline Wong)
