Budweiser has held a place in America’s top three most popular beers since at least the 1970s, according to data from Beer Marketer’s Insights. Until 2001, it carried the top spot, at which time it was knocked out by its lighter cousin, Bud Light. And in 2011, Coors Light overtook Budweiser as the number two most popular beer.

While the picture is particularly bleak for Budweiser (bud) , the top three beers have fallen on tough times as well. The sales dropped for all of them in 2017, due in no small part to the rise of craft beers.

However, signs point to slowing growth for the craft beer industry as well. Shipments fell at six of the seven top craft beer brands in 2017, according to Beer Marketer’s Insights.
