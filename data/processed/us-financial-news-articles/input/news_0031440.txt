(NYSE: NOV) today announced it combined its Rig Systems and Rig Aftermarket reporting segments into a single segment called Rig Technologies during the fourth quarter of 2017.

Operating profit (loss) $ 2,531 $ 1,501 $ (1,033 ) $ 13 $ 6 $ 18 Other Items 23 124 1,255 12 17 - Depreciation and Amortization 112 107 94 22 23 22 Adjusted EBITDA $ 2,666 $ 1,732 $ 316 $ 47 $ 46 $ 40 The Company anticipates it will recognize between $120 and $140 million in pre-tax restructuring charges, including facility closures, severance and inventory write-downs, and other charges (collectively “other items”) during the fourth quarter of 2017.
Excluding the impact of other items, the Company expects consolidated results for the fourth quarter of 2017 to be at or above prior expectations. The Company anticipates Rig Technologies will exceed prior guidance, Wellbore Technologies will be in-line with expectations, and Completion and Production Solutions will fall short of guidance. The shortfall in Completion and Production Solutions is due primarily to engineering challenges and delivery delays associated with a new product introduction in its Subsea Flexible Pipe business and softer than anticipated orders in its Process and Flow Technologies business.
