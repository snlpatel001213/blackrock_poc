In recent days, AML BitCoin tokens have been the rage of coin enthusiasts in Japan and South Korea, and Andrade reports a surge of purchase inquiries from Germany in the past 24 hours. “Each day brings scores of new enthusiasts to our digital currency,” revealed Andrade. “As governments across the globe enunciate national policy concerns with anonymous bitcoin and altcoins, and their use by terrorists and criminals, we have seen mounting interest in AML BitCoin, the world’s only compliant digital currency.”
Andrade also announced today that AML BitCoin has been approved for the trading symbol ABTC. “Our new trading symbol will help differentiate our project from other cryptocurrencies, while still providing our coin holders a connection to traditional digital currency.
