HONG KONG, Jan 23 (Reuters) - China’s Leshi Internet Technology shares will resume trading on Wednesday after a nine-month suspension, the company said in a filing on Tuesday.
The company asked in April for trading to be suspended pending an acquisition of LeEco’s film unit for 9.8 billion yuan ($1.53 billion), a plan it eventually scrapped last week. ($1 = 6.4000 Chinese yuan renminbi) (Reporting by Sijia Jiang; Editing by David Goodman)
