DAVOS, Switzerland (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Theresa May told business leaders in Davos on Thursday that countries must not start pulling in different directions on trade. 
She added that the World Trade Organisation must go further in its reforms. 
“Too often our rhetoric in support of free trade here in Davos is not matched by our actions,” she said. 
“The World Trade Organisation still needs to go much further in its reforms, ensuring its rule book keeps pace with developments in the global economy.” Reporting by Noah Barkin; writing by Kate Holton, editing by Guy Faulconbridge
