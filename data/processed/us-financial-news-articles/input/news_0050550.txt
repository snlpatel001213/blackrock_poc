MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico-based company ICA Fluor has won a contract to build the medium-voltage electrical distribution network for the new Mexico City airport, the state-run company overseeing the project said on Friday. 
Grupo Aeroportuario de Mexico City (GACM) said ICA Fluor won the 3.656 billion peso ($198 million) tender in conjunction with Mexican firm Industria del Hierro. 
ICA Fluor is a joint venture between Mexican construction company ICA ( ICA.MX ) and U.S. engineering firm Fluor Corp ( FLR.N ). 
Struggling with heavy debt, ICA said in August it had filed a pre-packaged bankruptcy plan that had been subscribed to by the majority of its creditors. Reporting by Noe Torres; Editing by Tom Hogue
