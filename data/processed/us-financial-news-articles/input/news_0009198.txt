TORONTO, Jan. 10, 2018 /PRNewswire/ - Corus Entertainment Inc. (TSX: CJR.B) announced its first quarter financial results today.
"Our first quarter results were below expectations, as gains in local Radio advertising and our Nelvana content business combined with better than expected subscriber revenues were more than offset by weak television advertising market conditions", said Doug Murphy, President and Chief Executive Officer. "We remain committed to advancing our strategic priorities as Canada's only pure play media and content company. Our ongoing financial discipline balanced with strategic growth investments in content and advanced advertising initiatives position us well over the longer term in a rapidly evolving media and content marketplace."

Use of Non-IFRS Financial Measures
This press release includes the non-IFRS financial measures of adjusted net income, adjusted basic earnings per share and free cash flow that are not in accordance with, nor an alternate to, generally accepted accounting principles ("IFRS") and may be different from non-IFRS measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-IFRS measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles.
Non-IFRS financial measures should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with IFRS. They are limited in value because they exclude charges that have a material effect on the Company's reported results and, therefore, should not be relied upon as the sole financial measures to evaluate the Company's financial results. The non-IFRS financial measures are meant to supplement, and to be viewed in conjunction with, IFRS financial results. A reconciliation of the Company's non-IFRS measures is included in the Company's most recent Report to Shareholders which is available on Corus' website at www.corusent.com as well as on SEDAR.
