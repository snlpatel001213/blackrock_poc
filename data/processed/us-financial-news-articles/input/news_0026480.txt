Hong Kong democracy leader Joshua Wong jailed a second time for 2014 protest Published 17 Hours Ago SHARES Damir Sagolj | Reuters Student protest leader Joshua Wong shouts as he is carried by policemen as protesters are arrested at a monument symbolizing the city's handover from British to Chinese rule, a day before Chinese President Xi Jinping is due to arrive for the celebrations, in Hong Kong, China June 28, 2017. 
Hong Kong democracy activist Joshua Wong, 21, was sentenced to a second jail term of three months on Wednesday for his role in the 2014 pro-democracy "Umbrella Movement" street occupations. 
Wong had chosen not to fight the contempt of court charge that was laid against him after he refused to obey a court injunction order and leave a protest site. 
Several other activists were also jailed including Lester Shum. 
Wong began serving a six-month jail term last August for a separate unlawful assembly charge, but the bespectacled activist was granted bail by Hong Kong's highest court, which heard the appeal against the sentence on Tuesday. It would decide upon the case on a later date.
