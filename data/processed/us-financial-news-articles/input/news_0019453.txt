BERLIN (Reuters) - German Chancellor Angela Merkel wants to conclude negotiations with the Social Democrats (SPD) on forming a coalition government by mid-February, a source in her conservative party said on Friday. 
The goal is to give the SPD ample time to hold a postal vote among its members on the coalition agreement with Merkel’s Christian Democrats (CDU) and their Christian Social Union (CSU) Bavaria-based allies. 
Merkel’s conservatives had said they want to have a government in place by the end of March. Related Coverage
