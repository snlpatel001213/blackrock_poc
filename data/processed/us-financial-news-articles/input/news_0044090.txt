Senior forward Gary Clark registered 17 points and 10 rebounds for his fourth consecutive double-double as No. 9 Cincinnati rolled to a 75-42 victory over Temple on Wednesday in American Athletic Conference play at Highland Heights, Ky.
Senior forward Kyle Washington contributed 13 points and nine rebounds as the Bearcats (18-2, 7-0 AAC) won their 11th consecutive contest. Sophomore guard Jarron Cumberland also scored 13 points and junior guard Jacob Evans added 10 points, six rebounds, five assists and a career-high five steals as Cincinnati stretched its national-best home winning streak to 37 games.
The Bearcats are playing their home games across the river at BB&T Arena in Kentucky this season while Fifth Third Arena is being renovated.
Temple didn’t have a single player score in double digits while committing 20 turnovers, shooting 28.6 percent from the field -- including 3 of 23 from 3-point range -- and 43.8 percent from the free throw line. Junior center Ernest Aflakpui and sophomore guard Quinton Rose scored seven points apiece for the Owls (10-10, 2-6), who posted their second fewest points of the campaign.
Clark made 6 of 7 field goal attempts while becoming the fifth player in Cincinnati history to top 1,000 career rebounds and also the fifth player to reach at least 1,000 points and 1,000 rebounds.
