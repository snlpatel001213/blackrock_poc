TOKYO (Reuters) - Eleven countries aiming to forge a new Asia-Pacific trade pact after the United States dropped out of an earlier version last year will hold a signing ceremony in Chile in March, Kyodo news agency said on Tuesday, citing a Japanese source. 
Trade officials from the 11 countries have been meeting in Tokyo to try to resolve rifts including Canadaâ€™s insistence on protection of its cultural industries such as movies, TV and music. 
Japan has been lobbying hard to save the pact, originally called the Trans-Pacific Partnership, after President Donald Trump pulled the United States out of the original 12-nation trade agreement last year. The new deal is known as the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTTP), or TPP-11. Writing by Linda Sieg; Editing by Nick Macfie
