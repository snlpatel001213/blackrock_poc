Today we are reporting double-digit revenue growth in 2017 of more than $600 million, along with strong bottom-line cash generation. Throughout the year, we also achieved many important goals that will be key to our long-term success, including the establishment of our new 200-person women’s health commercial team, the launch of Intrarosa® (prasterone), a novel women’s health product, and the filing of supplemental new drug applications to extend our Makena and Feraheme brands.”
“Our flexible operating plan supports the 2018 top-line revenue and adjusted EBITDA guidance ranges provided today, which incorporate the opportunities and key risks across our product portfolio. 2018 promises to be an exciting year for AMAG with many key value drivers ahead of us, including potential FDA approvals of the Makena subcutaneous auto-injector and the Feraheme broad label, as well as building on the successful launch of Intrarosa, with approximately 20,000 total prescriptions already written by more than 4,200 healthcare providers since our July 2017 launch,” Mr. Heiden concluded.
