Three weeks into the new year, Sony Pictures is in an unfamiliar position: first place. 
After a dismal five-year run, Sony Corp.’s SNE, +1.46% 6758, +1.16% motion-picture business has outgrossed all competitors so far in 2018 thanks to a smash-hit sequel to a 1995 family film. 
“Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle” is No. 1 at the U.S. box office for the third weekend in a row, with an estimated $20 million. Its total worldwide gross is $768 million. The movie’s production budget was about $130 million, but thanks to tax credits in Hawaii and Georgia, where it was shot, it cost Sony just under $100 million, meaning it should be very profitable. 
Its success is particularly notable because Sony opened “Jumanji” in a spot many studios considered suicide for a film with global blockbuster aspirations: One week after a new “Star Wars” installment. “Jumanji” opened Dec. 20 and grossed $36.2 million its first weekend in the U.S. and Canada, far behind $71.6 million for Walt Disney Co.’s DIS, +0.15% “Star Wars: The Last Jedi,” which made its debut the prior week. But by the next weekend, strong word-of-mouth pushed “Jumanji” into a near-tie with “Star Wars” and since then, its ticket sales have declined slower, making it No. 1.
