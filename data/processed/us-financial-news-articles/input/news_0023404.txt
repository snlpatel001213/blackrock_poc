Citi said it had conducted a survey in the three countries, where it found that women and minorities are paid slightly less than men and non-minorities, respectively. 
Compensation would be raised based on the pay gaps identified in the survey, Citi spokeswoman Jennifer Lowney said. 
Citi, along with other U.S. banks and credit card companies, had been under investor pressure to disclose the gender pay gap. The company’s activist investor Arjuna Capital asked Citi’s shareholders last year to vote in favour of a proposal requiring the bank to address the gender pay gap. 
“Women are paid on average 99 percent of what men are paid and minorities are paid on average 99 percent of what non-minorities are paid,” Citi said in a memo to employees, referring to the survey in the United States, Britain and Germany. 
The company also said it would adjust compensation for other individuals, where the analysis determined increases were necessary. ( citi.us/2B2PnD8 ) Reporting by Divya Grover in Bengaluru; Editing by Frances Kerry
