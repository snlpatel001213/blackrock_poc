(Reuters) - French outdoor advertising company JCDecaux ( JCDX.PA ) beat its fourth-quarter revenue target, it said on Tuesday, citing improving French and Chinese markets.
The group’s fourth-quarter adjusted revenue was 1.02 billion euros ($1.27 billion). That represented 6.5 percent organic growth, beating the 4.5 percent forecast in November.
“This strong performance reflects a growing contribution from our digital street furniture assets and the recovery of our operations in China, combined with an improvement in France, as well as solid revenue growth in the U.S. and in the rest of Europe,” Co-Chief Executive Jean-François Decaux said in a statement.
The company’s transport business delivered quarterly growth up almost 12 percent year on year.
Full-year results are due to be published on March 8, along with first-quarter guidance.
