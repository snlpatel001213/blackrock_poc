The Group's gross margin rate benefited from the increase in sales volumes over the quarter to stand at 33% of the consolidated sales, compared to 27% in the previous quarter and 32% in the fourth quarter of 2016. For the fourth quarter of 2017, the gross margin amounted to 1.2 million euros compared to 0.6 million euros for the third quarter of 2017 and 1.1 million euros for the fourth quarter of 2016.
The amount of operating expenses at 1.0 million euros remained in line with the previous quarters. The tax expense recognized during the quarter corresponds to the change in deferred tax assets, without any impact on the Group's cash position.
Consequently, the Group reported operating and net profits of 0.2 million euros for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to operating and net losses at 0.3 million euros for the third quarter of 2017 and operating and net profits of 0.1 million euros for the fourth quarter of 2016.

As previously announced, MEMSCAP has initiated in 2017 the transformation of its industrial organization in order to increase significantly the flexibility of the Group's production capacities. This program is progressing according to the Company’s plans. In line with its strategy focused on the high-added-value segments of aerospace, medical and optical communications, the Group is continuing its disengagement from low-margin services in favour of the development of its activities backed by its own intellectual property.
Though this evolution has impacted the profitability of MEMSCAP over the financial year 2017, it should enable the Group to benefit from a marked increase in its margin levels over the coming years.
