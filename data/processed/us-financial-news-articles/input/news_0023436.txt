“EPCR is currently investigating comments attributed to RC Toulon president Mourad Boudjellal,” the Champions Cup organisers said in a statement. 
“If EPCR feels that these comments are inappropriate... Mr Boudjellal could face disciplinary action.” 
Bastareaud made the comments during a 36-0 Champions Cup victory against Benetton Treviso on Sunday before apologising on social media. 
Boudjellal, however, told French rugby website rugbyrama.fr: “At no point did Mathieu Bastareaud make a judgement on the sexual orientation of the player in question. I am not homophobic but I have already called someone a faggot. It’s become customary, it’s the first thing that comes to mind in an altercation.” Reporting by Julien Pretot; Editing by Christian Radnedge
