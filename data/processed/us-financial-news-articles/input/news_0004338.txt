The order was effective as of Jan 2. 
Russia halted civilian air traffic to Egypt in 2015 after militants detonated a bomb on a Russian Metrojet flight leaving the tourist resort of Sharm el-Sheikh, killing 224 people on board. 
The bombing and the Russian suspension were blows to Egypt’s tourism industry, a key source of hard currency. Reporting by Denis Pinchuk; editing by John Stonestreet
