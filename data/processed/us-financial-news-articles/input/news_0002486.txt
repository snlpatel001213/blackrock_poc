SEOUL (Reuters) - Samsung Electronics Co Ltd ( 005930.KS ) plans to begin operating its new washing machine factory in the United States this month, a top executive said on Wednesday, as it awaits a U.S. government decision on curbing imports of washers. 
The U.S. International Trade Commision recommended in November tariffs to keep Samsung and its home rival LG Electronics Inc ( 066570.KS ) from flooding the U.S. market with inexpensive washers, a step that would benefit American appliance giant Whirlpool Corp ( WHR.N ). 
Samsung said at the time that any tariffs would raise prices and impair job creation at its $380 million plant in South Carolina, which was announced in June to produce washing machines and other appliances. 
U.S. President Donald Trump is expected to make a decision on the recommendation early this year. 
When asked about whether the plant will begin operations this month, Samsung Electronics Vice Chairman Yoon Boo-keun confirmed the plan to reporters on Wednesday. He did not elaborate. 
The plant, Samsungâ€™s first U.S. appliances factory in more than three decades, was among a long list of investment pledges by global companies reacting to pressure from Trump to create more U.S. jobs.
