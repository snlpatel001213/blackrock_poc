SANDUSKY, Ohio, Jan. 26, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Civista Bancshares, Inc. (NASDAQ: CIVB) ("Civista") reported net income available to common shareholders of $3.7 million, or $0.32 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared with $3.3 million, or $0.33 per diluted share, for the prior year period. For the year ended December 31, 2017, Civista reported net income available to common shareholders of $14.6 million or $1.28 per diluted share, compared to $15.7 million, or $1.57 per diluted share, in the same period of 2016. The fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2017 results included two loan recoveries which added $252 thousand, after tax. The 2016 results for twelve-month period were impacted by a large loan recovery that resulted in approximately $1.5 million net income after taxes. In addition, we issued approximately 1.6 million new shares in February 2017 related to raising $32.8 million of additional capital, net of costs. The 2017 impact of the Tax Cut and Jobs Act was a net write down of $511 thousand, or approximately $0.05 per diluted share of net deferred tax assets.
"2017 was another strong year for Civista. We had many financial and non-financial accomplishments. When you remove the noise from the loan recoveries both in 2016 and 2017 and the tax expense impact of the Tax Cut and Jobs Act, our net income is up $389 thousand. We had a very successful $32.8 million capital raise in February which was largely oversubscribed. We have invested in a loan production office in Westlake and added lenders in our more vibrant markets. Our loan growth for the year was 10.3%. We were successful in improving our CRA rating, which allows us to pursue acquisitions again. Finally, we have completed our CEO succession with the retirement of Jim Miller. We thank Jim for his 31 years of service and look forward to his continued involvement on our board," said Dennis G. Shaffer, President and CEO of Civista.
Results of Operations :
Net interest income for the fourth quarter of 2017 increased $2.0 million, or 16.0% compared to the same period of 2016 and for the year ended December 31 increased $4.2 million, or 8.4%, compared to 2016. An increase in average loans outstanding primarily contributed to the increase in interest income for the fourth quarter and year ended 2017. The net interest income for the fourth quarter of 2017 included approximately $387 thousand of recovered interest income on two previously nonaccrual loans, which resulted in approximately 10 basis points of additional net interest margin for the fourth quarter and 2 basis points for the year ended 2017. The net interest income for the twelve-month period in 2016 included approximately $919 thousand of recovered interest income on a previous nonaccrual loan, which resulted in approximately 9 basis points of additional net interest margin. An increase in market interest rates and an increase in brokered deposits contributed to the increase in interest expense. The Federal Reserve increased short-term interest rates 75 basis points during 2017. Tax equivalent net interest margin was 4.24% for the fourth quarter, compared to 4.05% for the same period a year ago and was 4.01% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, compared to 3.93% for the same period a year ago.

Gain on sale of loans increased $129 thousand, or 31.5%, for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2016. ATM/Interchange fees increased $151 thousand and $210 thousand for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to $100 thousand incentive received related the 2017 debit card conversion. Wealth management fees increased $146 thousand, or 21.2%, and $390 thousand, or 14.6%, for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2017 due to increased assets under management as well as market conditions. Assets under management have increased $17.0 million since the end of the third quarter 2017 and $48.8 million during 2017. Other income decreased $341 for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to 2016, primarily due to a $173 thousand decrease in swap income and a $180 thousand decrease in gain/loss on sale of OREO properties.
During the quarter, noninterest expense totaled $12.4 million, an increase of $1.7 million, or 15.7%, compared to the prior year's fourth quarter. Year-to-date noninterest expense increased $4.7 million, or 10.8%, when compared to the twelve months of 2016.

Compensation expense increased $1.3 million for the fourth quarter and $3.9 million for the year ending December 31, 2017.
The increases in compensation expense for both periods were due to an increase of fourteen full time equivalent employees, $864 thousand and $2.6 million of normal merit raises, commissions and incentives, $186 thousand and $526 thousand of insurance costs and $259 thousand and $740 thousand of pension expense. The pension expense increases are due to a pension curtailment incurred upon the retirement of some senior executives. Professional services costs increased $137 thousand for the fourth quarter and $405 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily attributable to the Company retaining professional services to analyze its' workflow systems and recommend process improvements and the reintroduction of state examination fees. Other expenses increased $443 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2017. Approximately $243 thousand of the increase is attributable to ATM/Interchange expenses, due to vendor credits that expired in the second quarter of 2016 and unreimbursed expenses related to the 2017 debit card conversion.
The efficiency ratio was 67.0% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 compared to 64.7% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016. The increase in the efficiency ratio is due primarily to the increase in noninterest expense, partially offset by an increase in net interest income.
Balance Sheet
Total assets increased $148.6 million, or 10.8%, from December 31, 2016 to December 31, 2017, primarily due to an increase in the loan portfolio of $109.2 million and an increase in investment securities of $35.2 million.
The $109.2 million, or 10.3%, increase in the loan portfolio from December 31, 2016 to December 31, 2017, continues to come from growth in our Commercial and Agriculture, Commercial Real Estate and Residential Real Estate loan portfolios. The majority of the loan growth continued to come from our metropolitan markets. Real Estate Construction loans also increased this year, due to very successful development lending and multi-family projects.
