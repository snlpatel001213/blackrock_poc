WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Canada’s launching of a wide-ranging trade dispute against the United States at the World Trade Organization is a “broad and ill-advised attack on the U.S. trade remedies system,” U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said on Wednesday.
“Canada’s claims are unfounded and could only lower U.S. confidence that Canada is committed to mutually beneficial trade,” Lighthizer added in a statement issued in Washington.
