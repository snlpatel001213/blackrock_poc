“The fourth quarter 2017 was the twelfth consecutive quarter of active patient and revenue growth since the presentation of our EF-14 data in newly diagnosed GBM,” said William Doyle, Novocure’s Executive Chairman. “We continued to execute on our commercialization strategy, achieving 68 percent active patient growth compared to the same period last year. Importantly, we also received national government reimbursement in Japan for Optune for the treatment of newly diagnosed glioblastoma during the fourth quarter 2017, a significant milestone that represents our expanding commercial presence in markets across the globe.”
“Tumor Treating Fields shows promise for a variety of solid tumors and we remain committed to realizing the full potential value of the platform across multiple solid tumor indications,” continued Mr. Doyle. “We continue to recruit patients for two ongoing phase 3 pivotal trials: our LUNAR trial in non-small cell lung cancer and our METIS trial in brain metastases from non-small cell lung cancer. We have also received U.S. Food and Drug Administration Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) approval to initiate our PANOVA 3 phase 3 pivotal trial in locally advanced pancreatic cancer. We look forward to providing a company update and discussing our 2017 financial results on our February conference call.”
