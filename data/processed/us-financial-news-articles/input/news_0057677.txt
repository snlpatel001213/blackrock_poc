On January 29, 2018, MetLife issued a news release stating it postponed its earnings report for its fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2017 financial results.
The Company disclosed (1) certain material weaknesses in financial reporting, (2) it expects to increase reserves in total between $525 million and $575 million pretax, (3) it expects revisions to prior periods to be included in MetLife's 2017 Form 10-K, and (4) the SEC enforcement staff has made an inquiry regarding these matters.
This news drove the price of MetLife shares down nearly 9% during intraday trading on January 30, 2018.
"We're focused on MetLife's expected prior period adjustments, whether the Company and management did not follow Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, and damages suffered by MetLife investors," said Hagens Berman partner Reed Kathrein.
