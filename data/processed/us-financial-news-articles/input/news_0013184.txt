CAIRO, Jan 8 (Reuters) - The average yield on Egyptian one-year dollar-denominated treasury bills fell to 3.346 percent on Monday from 3.495 percent at the last auction on Dec. 11, the central bank said.
The Finance Ministry sold $944.5 million in treasury bills to local and foreign financial institutions. The bills mature on Jan. 8, 2019.
Appetite for Egyptâ€™s domestic debt has grown since the central bank floated the pound currency in November 2016 as part of a deal for a $12 billion International Monetary Fund loan. (Reporting by Nadine Awadalla and Arwa Gaballa; Editing by Patrick Werr and Toby Chopra)
