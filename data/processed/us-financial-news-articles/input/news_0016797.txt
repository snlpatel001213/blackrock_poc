U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen cautioned Sunday that Americans should not react to Saturday’s false alarm in Hawaii, warning of a nonexistent ballistic missile attack, by disregarding emergency warnings in the future. 
“I would hate for everyone not to abide by alerts coming from government systems,” Nielsen said on Fox News Sunday. “These alerts are vital.” Calling the false alarm an “unfortunate situation,” Nielsen added, “We’re all working together to make sure it doesn’t happen again.” 
Federal, state and local officials continued their efforts Sunday to determine how to prevent a recurrence of the panic that was triggered when a Hawaii state employee hit the wrong button on a computer during a shift change, accidentally sending an alert to many of the state’s cellphones. “BALLISTIC MISSILE THREAT INBOUND TO HAWAII,” the alert said, in all-caps, to the island chain of about 1.4 million people. “SEEK IMMEDIATE SHELTER. THIS IS NOT A DRILL.” 
Authorities canceled the alert six minutes later in an effort to stop it from being sent to people who hadn’t already received it. But it took 38 minutes for a second alert to be sent out canceling the first, and officials at all levels said Sunday the incident exposed significant flaws in the emergency-alert system.
