SHANGHAI, Jan 12 (Reuters) - A subsidiary of China National Petroleum Corp (CNPC), the country’s largest oil producer, is looking for new sources of natural gas in Myanmar to feed a pipeline between the two nations, the China Daily reported on Friday.
CNPC Southeast Asia Pipeline Co Ltd is seeking additional gas to supply the pipeline which runs from Daewoo International’s offshore blocks in Myanmar, said Chen Xiangqiu, vice president of the gas pipeline project, according to the paper.
The company has been transporting gas from Daewoo International’s fields under a 30-year deal that started in mid-2013.
Chen said the CNPC unit had been looking for new gas deposits in Myanmar, as well as keeping abreast of progress on new gas fields developed there by Daewoo International and others.
The firm is also considering building a liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminal at the Made Island oil port in the western Myanmar state of Rakhine, the starting point of the Myanmar-China pipeline.
Violence in Rakhine has prompted some 650,000 Rohingya Muslims to flee to Bangladesh in recent months.
CNPC produced about 3 billion cubic meters (bcm) of shale gas in the southwestern Chinese province of Sichuan in 2017, the official Sichuan Daily said earlier this month. (Reporting by Engen Tham; Editing by Joseph Radford)
