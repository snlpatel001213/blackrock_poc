General Dynamics (NYSE: GD) today reported fourth-quarter 2017 earnings from continuing operations of $636 million, a 9.7 percent increase over fourth-quarter 2016, on revenue of $8.3 billion. Diluted earnings per share (EPS) from continuing operations was up 11.1 percent to $2.10 compared to $1.89 in the year-ago quarter. Absent a one-time, non-cash decrement to earnings from the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, earnings from continuing operations were $755 million, up 30.2 percent and diluted EPS from continuing operations was $2.50, a 32.3 percent increase (see Exhibit A).
Full-year Results
Full-year earnings from continuing operations were $2.9 billion, an 8.7 percent increase from 2016 on revenue of $31 billion. Diluted EPS from continuing operations was up 10.6 percent to $9.56 compared to full-year 2016. Excluding the impact of tax reform, full-year earnings from continuing operations were $3 billion, up 13.1 percent, and diluted EPS from continuing operations was $9.95, a 15.2 percent increase (see Exhibit B).
"General Dynamics delivered strong results in 2017, with growth in revenue, earnings, margins and EPS," said Phebe Novakovic, chairman and chief executive officer of General Dynamics. "We are investing for the future and executing on our robust backlog. We see continued demand for our products, with backlog growth in 2017 in our defense business and strong order intake across the Gulfstream portfolio."
Margin
Company-wide operating margin was 12.5 percent for the fourth quarter, 250 basis points higher than the fourth-quarter 2016 margin. For the full year, operating margin was 13.5 percent, 130 basis points higher than the 2016 full-year margin. Margins improved in all four segments in both the fourth quarter and full year.

EXHIBITS A and B (cont.)
CALCULATION OF ADJUSTED NON-GAAP PROVISION FOR INCOME TAX, EARNINGS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS AND DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS - (UNAUDITED)
DOLLARS IN MILLIONS, EXCEPT PER SHARE AMOUNTS
Exhibits A and B include the following measures that are not calculated in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP):
Adjusted non-GAAP provision for income tax, Adjusted non-GAAP earnings from continuing operations, and Adjusted non-GAAP diluted earnings per share from continuing operations (EPS).
These measures exclude the impact of tax reform enacted in December 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA). The TCJA has several key provisions, most significantly reducing the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% beginning in 2018. However, the impact of tax reform must be accounted for in 2017, primarily the remeasurement of U.S. federal deferred tax assets and liabilities at the tax rate expected to apply when the temporary differences are realized/settled (remeasured at a rate of 21% versus 35% for the majority of our deferred tax assets and liabilities). This impact is considered by management a one-time, non-cash event. Therefore, management developed the non-GAAP measures, which are used to evaluate results and analyze trends. Management believes the measures are also useful supplemental information for investors to understand the company's results.
The GAAP measure comparable to adjusted non-GAAP provision for income tax is provision for income tax. The GAAP measure comparable to adjusted non-GAAP earnings from continuing operations is earnings from continuing operations. The GAAP measure comparable to adjusted non-GAAP diluted earnings per share from continuing operations is diluted earnings per share from continuing operations. Exhibits A and B provide reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the corresponding GAAP measures.

PRELIMINARY FINANCIAL INFORMATION - (UNAUDITED)
DOLLARS IN MILLIONS, EXCEPT PER SHARE AMOUNTS
(a)
Prior-period information has been restated for the adoption of ASC Topic 606, which we adopted on January 1, 2017.
(b)
Return on equity is calculated by dividing earnings from continuing operations for the latest 12-month period by our average equity during that period.
(c)
Debt-to-equity ratio is calculated as total debt divided by total equity as of year end.
(d)
Debt-to-capital ratio is calculated as total debt divided by the sum of total debt plus total equity as of year end.
(e)
Book value per share is calculated as total equity divided by total outstanding shares as of year end.
(f)
Includes independent research and development and Aerospace product-development costs.
(g)
We believe free cash flow from operations is a useful measure for investors because it portrays our ability to generate cash from our businesses for purposes such as repaying maturing debt, funding business acquisitions, repurchasing our common stock and paying dividends. We use free cash flow from operations to assess the quality of our earnings and as a performance measure in evaluating management. The most directly comparable GAAP measure to free cash flow from operations is net cash provided by operating activities.
(h)
We believe return on invested capital (ROIC) is a useful measure for investors because it reflects our ability to generate returns from the capital we have deployed in our operations. We use ROIC to evaluate investment decisions and as a performance measure in evaluating management. We define ROIC as net operating profit after taxes divided by average invested capital. Net operating profit after taxes is defined as earnings from continuing operations plus after-tax interest and amortization expense. Average invested capital is defined as the sum of the average debt and shareholders' equity excluding accumulated other comprehensive loss for the year. ROIC excludes goodwill impairments and non-economic accounting changes as they are not reflective of company performance. The most directly comparable GAAP measure to net operating profit after taxes is earnings from continuing operations. After-tax interest and amortization expense is calculated using the statutory tax rate of 35 percent.

The estimated potential contract value includes work awarded on unfunded indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contracts and unexercised options associated with existing firm contracts, including options to purchase new aircraft and long-term aircraft services agreements. The actual amount of funding received in the future may be higher or lower than our estimate of potential contract value. We recognize options in backlog when the customer exercises the option and establishes a firm order.
