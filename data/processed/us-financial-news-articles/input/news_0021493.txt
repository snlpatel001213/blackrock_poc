LEAD seeks to invest in companies most likely to grow their dividends, grew assets under management by more than 475 percent in 2017
SAN DIEGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- The Reality Shares DIVCON Leaders Dividend ETF (NYSE Arca: LEAD), which identifies and seeks to invest in likely dividend growers, celebrates its second full year of trading with an 18.05 percent annualized return since inception. 1
LEAD utilizes Reality Shares’ proprietary dividend health rating system, DIVCON™, which analyzes seven quantitative factors to determine which stocks are most likely to grow their dividends. Of its portfolio constituents, none have cut their dividends in the entirety of the fund’s existence, and 99 percent have increased dividends. 2
“In the current momentum-driven market, long-term investors have appreciated LEAD’s rules-based approach and its reliance on long-term, sustainable equities – rather than momentum stocks that run-up quickly and have the potential to fizzle out just as quickly,” said Eric Ervin, CEO of Reality Shares. “We created LEAD so investors would have an easy way to invest in some of the healthiest and potentially most promising dividend-paying stocks in the S&P 500.”
In 2017, LEAD’s assets under management increased by more than 475 percent and the fund returned 25.07 percent, and since inception, LEAD’s holdings have recorded a 5-year median dividend growth of 15.20 percent, compared to 6.74 percent for the S&P 500. 3
