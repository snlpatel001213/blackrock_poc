LOS ANGELES, Jan. 29, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- GameMine Inc., a US-based mobile game publisher, is announcing today it has become profitable. The achievement of positive revenue is being attributed to GameMine's recent expansion into new international territories, as well as aggressive growth of its diverse library of mobile game titles throughout 2017. This financial stability comes on the heels of GameMine successfully raising $20 million in series A venture capital, making several strategic executive hires, and securing multiple international distribution partnerships.
"The impressive growth of GameMine's mobile game library in 2017 allowed us to secure several new international distribution partnerships as well as significantly expand our existing partnerships with a range of European and African mobile carriers," says Daniel Starr, Global CEO of GameMine. "We have also partnered with Nickelodeon to offer subscribers a range of mobile games featuring globally recognized characters like SpongeBob SquarePants and The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. The diversity of our game library plus these partnerships' expansion of territories where GameMine is available effectively skyrocketed our subscriber base which pushed us solidly into profitability, so much so that we're on track to do more than $20 million in profits before the end of 2018."
