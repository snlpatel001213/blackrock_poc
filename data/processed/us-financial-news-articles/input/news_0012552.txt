Mitt Romney , who is reportedly leaning toward a run for Senate later this year, was treated for prostate cancer over the summer, NBC News and CNN reported, citing sources. 
"Last year, Governor Mitt Romney was diagnosed with slow-growing prostate cancer. The cancer was removed surgically and found not to have spread beyond the prostate," a Romney aide told NBC. 
The former Massachusetts governor and GOP presidential nominee's prognosis is "good," CNN reported. He was "successfully treated," the news network said.

Last week, Sen. Orrin Hatch , R-Utah, said he would not seek re-election in November. Romney is likely to run for that seat, CNBC and other outlets reported. 
President Donald Trump spoke to Romney, who is at times a fierce critic of the president, on Thursday night. He wished Romney luck in his future endeavors, according to Politico . 
Trump had urged Hatch, 83, to stay in the Senate.
