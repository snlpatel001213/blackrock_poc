"It is not just interest rates that continue to rise; inflation expectations are rising with them," said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group, in a note. He also said 2.8 percent is the next key level to watch on the 10-year.

Stocks closed at record highs on Friday, with the Dow surging more than 200 points, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq climbed more than 1 percent. Tech was one of the best-performing sectors on Friday after Intel reported strong quarterly results. 
"Last week reinforced that tech remains a critically important sector for the market, and tech must remain stable if stocks can rally short term," Tom Essaye, founder of The Sevens Report, said in a note. "We saw that in the price action last week. The whole week's gains came on Monday and Friday." 
Equities were also boosted last week by stronger-than-expected quarterly results from major companies. Thus far, the corporate earnings season has been strong. Of the S&P 500 companies that have reported as of Monday morning, 78 percent have reported surpassed bottom-line expectations, while 77 percent have beaten revenue estimates, according to FactSet. 
Boeing, McDonald's, Apple, Chevron, and Facebook are among the companies scheduled to report later this week. 
Kim Forrest, senior equity analyst at Fort Pitt Capital, said she is not too worried about the rise in interest rates, noting: "As long as companies continue to earn, the market will be fine." 
This will be a big week for Wall Street. The Federal Reserve's latest monetary policy decision is expected to be announced Wednesday. Later in the week, the U.S. government will release the latest employment figures.
