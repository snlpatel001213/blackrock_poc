Long Beach, CA , Jan. 03, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- RK Properties ( www.rkprop.com ) announced the sale in December of two multifamily properties: Villas on Bell , a 168-unit property located in Phoenix, AZ and Village at Fair Oaks , a 124-unit property located in Sacramento, CA.
Both sales, which totaled approximately $44 million, were facilitated by RK Properties on behalf of its 1031 Exchange TIC (Tenant–in-Common) investment program and the RK Multifamily Income Fund XIV (RKMIF XV) and RK Multifamily Income Fund XV (RKMIF XV).
Villas on Bell , constructed in 2002, is comprised of 168 one-, two- and three-bedroom apartments. The property sold at a premium above the investors’ 2004 purchase price.
Coupled with cash flow generated during the hold period, the sale resulted in total returns of 114% to the TIC investors and 120% to the shareholders in RKMIF XV (based on the aggregate amount of original capital invested in the property). This does not include the pass-through of tax benefits throughout the hold period. About 75% of the TICs are doing another 1031 tax deferred exchange into a new RK Properties acquisition.
“We are very proud of our 40-year multifamily track record of success, as demonstrated by our loyal following,” said Steve King, Vice President of RK Properties .
Village at Fair Oaks , constructed in 1985, is comprised of 124 one- and two-bedroom apartments. The property is situated on 4.75 acres in Fair Oaks, CA, a suburb less than 17 miles from downtown Sacramento.
The sale of that property resulted in returns of 96% to the TIC investors and 100% to the shareholders in RKMIF XIV (calculated as above). The holders of about 60% of TIC equity in the property will be rolling their proceeds from the sale into another 1031 tax deferred exchange through RK Properties .
Since its founding in 1976, RK Properties has purchased and managed over $1.5 billion in multifamily apartment assets. The Company offers multifamily replacement properties for 1031 tax deferred exchanges, as well as Fund investment opportunities for accredited investors who are seeking a real estate investment. As of year-end 2017, RK Properties has sponsored approximately 150 private placement programs, of which 125 programs have gone full cycle.
