It was Pavic’s second title of the tournament after winning the men’s doubles title with Austrian Oliver Marach. 
”It feels pretty good, I have to say,“ Pavic said of his two titles. “I did not imagine that I‘m able to do that. If somebody would have told me, I wouldn’t believe him.” Reporting by Ian Ransom; Editing by Amlan Chakraborty
