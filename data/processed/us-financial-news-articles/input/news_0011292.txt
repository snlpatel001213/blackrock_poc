The 26-year-old Uth, who played in the Dutch league for three seasons after leaving Cologne in 2012, is the joint leading German striker in the Bundesliga along with Kevin Volland on nine goals. 
His contract at Hoffenheim runs out at the end of the season. 
“Mark Uth is currently the Bundesliga’s most prolific German forward and will strengthen our attacking options even more from next summer,” said Schalke sports director Christian Heidel. 
“We are delighted that we have been able to bring him to FC Schalke 04.”
