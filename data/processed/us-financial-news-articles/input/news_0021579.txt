JAKARTA, Indonesia—Faulty components and a lack of maintenance likely contributed to the collapse of a mezzanine walkway at Indonesia’s stock-exchange building, experts said, based on preliminary inspections.
More than 70 people were injured when the walkway above the lobby of one of Jakarta’s most prestigious office buildings gave way Monday afternoon, with the majority still in hospitals Tuesday.
