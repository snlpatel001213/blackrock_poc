ZURICH, Jan 12 (Reuters) - The yield on the benchmark Swiss government 10-year bond moved into positive territory on Friday for the first time since October, Reuters data showed.
The move reflects rising global bond yields after the European Central Bank hinted this week that it could be gearing up to trim its massive monetary stimulus.
