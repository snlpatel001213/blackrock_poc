JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - A unit of African media and e-commerce giant Naspers said on Wednesday it will not renew its contract with a news channel previously owned by the Gupta family, friends of President Jacob Zuma accused of unduly influencing government.
The Gupta family and Zuma deny wrongdoing.
MultiChoice, the biggest pay-TV provider in Africa, said an investigation found the company had not done proper due diligence on ANN7 but there was no corruption in its contract.
The investigation followed a report by South African media about payments made by Multichoice to ANN7.
