Clinton Njie and Dmitri Payet found the net to put OM on 44 points from 21 games, nine points behind runaway leaders Paris St Germain, who take on Dijon on Wednesday. 
Monaco are third on 43 points after Mario Balotelli’s double earned Nice a 2-2 draw at the Louis II stadium in the Azurean derby. 
Marseille struggled to break the deadlock in a dull first half but found a way through after the break. 
Valere Germain missed a penalty in the 73rd minute but the home side were rewarded for their dominance 10 minutes from fulltime when Njie volleyed home from close range.

Yet Nice equalised through Balotelli two minutes into the second half when the Italian latched onto Allan Saint Maximin’s cross from the right. 
Balotelli put Nice ahead in the 68th, easing his way past Andrea Raggi before beating Danijel Subasic from close range. 
It was the Italian’s third double in four games against Monaco.
