The rain forced a 30 mile section of the 101 Freeway—the main artery between Ventura and Santa Barbara—to close due to flooding and debris, the CHP tweeted early Tuesday morning. Parts of the I-5 north were also closed. US 101 northbound & southbound CLOSED for flooding and debris flows in the #ThomasFire burn area (north of Ventura & south of Santa Barbara). I-5 is alternate route. SR-33 is closed just north of Ojai. AVOID AREA. @CHP_Ventura @CHP_SantaBarb @CaltransDist7 @VENTURASHERIFF pic.twitter.com/t7GjRrxY3b

— SBCFireInfo (@EliasonMike) January 9, 2018 Let’s just all accept that it’s not a good day to travel north from Ventura or Los Angeles Counties. US 101 is CLOSED north of Ventura for flooding/mud. I-5 northbound CLOSED at SR 118. Alternate Route, I-210 west to I-5 north will get you around this – or – SR 126 east to I-5. https://t.co/ZaP5CLNU94
