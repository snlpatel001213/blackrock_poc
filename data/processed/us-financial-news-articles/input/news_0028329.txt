Jan 18 (Reuters) - Losses in healthcare and industrial stocks paused Wall Street’s new year rally that had driven the blue-chip Dow index to its fastest ever 1,000 point rise.
The S&P healthcare index fell 0.47 percent, mostly due to losses in Merck J&J and Pfizer.
A 2.4 percent drop in Boeing’s high-flying stock kept the Dow in the red, a day after the index closed above the 26,000 mark for the first time.
“This might just be a little bit of a pullback, especially after yesterday’s significant gain, until we get further into the earnings season,” said Lindsey Bell, investment strategist at CFRA Research in New York.
Investors are keeping a close eye on corporate earnings reports, given the runup in stock valuations.
Morgan Stanley wrapped up earnings season for the big U.S. banks with a better-than-expected quarterly profit, driving modest gains in its shares.
Bank of New York Mellon fell about 5 percent after the custodian bank said it expected to book more in severance costs in 2018.
Alcoa tumbled 8 percent after the aluminum producer’s earnings missed analysts’ estimates.
At 12:31 p.m. ET (1731 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 87.74 points, or 0.34 percent, at 26,027.91 and the S&P 500 was down 3.67 points, or 0.13 percent, at 2,798.89.
The Nasdaq Composite was up 3.90 points, or 0.05 percent, at 7,302.18.
Yields on 10-year notes hit a 10-month high on Thursday after China’s fourth-quarter growth accelerated for the first time in seven years.
Sectors that are considered bond proxies, utilities and real estate, fell 1 percent and 0.8 percent, respectively. They have been among the worst performers since the start of 2018.
Oil prices gave up earlier losses, supported by a record drawdown of U.S. crude stockpiles at the Cushing, Oklahoma delivery hub. U.S. crude was up 0.08 percent at $64.02 per barrel.
Investors were also focused on the Republican efforts to pass a temporary extension in funding government operations and avert a shutdown, scheduling a vote on the measure in the afternoon.
