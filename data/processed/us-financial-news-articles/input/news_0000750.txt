Apple has apparently clarified its position on which iPhones qualify for a $29 battery replacement and which do not. 
After some customers took to Apple support forums to complain of the company not replacing batteries for $29, a French publication named iGeneration claims to have obtained internal documentation sent to Apple Stores that details which iPhones are eligible for the offer. According to that document, which has not been independently verified by Apple, the company will charge customers $29 for a battery replacement on all out-of-warranty iPhone 6 or newer handsets that are not otherwise damaged. 
According to 9to5Mac, which earlier reported on the move, some consumers say they visited Apple Stores and were not allowed to get a $29 iPhone battery replacement because their batteries were “ineligible.” In those cases, Apple Store employees performed a diagnostic test on the respective iPhone’s battery and because it had greater than 80% capacity left, some employees said it wouldn’t qualify, according to the report.
