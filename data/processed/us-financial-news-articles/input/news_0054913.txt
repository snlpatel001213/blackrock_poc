(Reuters) - Chelsea striker Michy Batshuayi has moved to Borussia Dortmund on loan until the end of the season, the Premier League club announced on Wednesday. 
Belgium international Batshuayi made 53 appearances for Chelsea in all competitions since joining the club from Olympique de Marseille in July 2016, scoring 19 goals. 
The 24-year-old, who represented his country at Euro 2016, hopes regular first-team action will help his chances of featuring more prominently at this year’s World Cup in Russia. 
“In order to achieve my big objective, I want to play as much as possible and score many goals. The World Cup is taking place in the summer,” he said in a statement. 
Batshuayi, who has scored 10 goals in all competitions this season, took advantage of a rare start to score twice as Chelsea eased past Newcastle United 3-0 at Stamford Bridge in the FA Cup last weekend. 
The German side will hope Batshuayi can fill the boots of the prolific Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, after the Gabon striker earlier completed a switch to Arsenal. Reporting by Hardik Vyas in Bengaluru, Editing by William Maclean
