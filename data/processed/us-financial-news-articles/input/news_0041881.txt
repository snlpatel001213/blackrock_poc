FOUNTAIN INN, S.C.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- AVX Corporation (NYSE: AVX) today reported preliminary unaudited results for the third quarter ended December 31, 2017.
Chief Executive Officer and President, John Sarvis, stated, “We completed the third quarter of our fiscal year with net sales of $431.8 million, reflecting an increase over both the previous quarter and the same quarter in the prior year. These results include sales of $90.5 million in our Interconnect, Sensing and Control division that are attributable to our acquisition of the AB Electronic sensing and control (“S&C”) business from TT Electronics, PLC in early October 2017. With continuing favorable market conditions, we saw healthy product demand in most of the markets we serve. As a result of the favorable U.S. tax reform law signed in December, as well as an enacted income tax rate reduction in France, we recorded estimated income tax charges of approximately $129.8 million in the quarter, consisting primarily of a charge for estimated taxes on un-repatriated accumulated overseas earnings.”
Also during the quarter, as discussed below, we announced an agreement to acquire Ethertronics Inc. (“Ethertronics”), a privately held manufacturer of passive and active antenna systems. The pending addition of Ethertronics provides an opportunity for AVX to expand our extensive electronic product offering into the rapidly expanding Internet of Things (“IoT”) wireless connectivity space. We are optimistic that the addition of the S&C business and Ethertronics will provide new and exciting growth opportunities for AVX going forward.
For the three and nine month periods ended December 31, 2017, net sales were $431.8 million and $1,115.8 million, respectively, compared to net sales of $340.8 million and $983.1 million, respectively, for the same period last year, reflecting the increased sales from our acquisition of the S&C business in addition to healthy global market conditions for our components and interconnect devices.
Profit from operations for the three and nine month periods ended December 31, 2017 were $45.3 million and $132.5 million, respectively, compared to operating profits of $50.9 million and $118.5 million for the three and nine month periods ended December 31, 2016. Profit from operations for the three and nine month periods ended December 31, 2016 include charges of $12.9 million and $28.1 million, respectively, related to previously disclosed intellectual property damages awards resulting from litigation with respect to patent infringement cases. Additionally, profit from operations for the nine month period ended December 31, 2016 reflects a charge of $3.6 million ($2.3 million after-tax) related to estimated environmental remediation costs resulting from legacy environmental issues at an inactive property.
Net loss for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 was $93.2 million, or $0.55 per share, reflecting estimated one-time income tax charges of approximately $129.8 million as described above. Net income for the quarter ended December 31, 2016 was $35.5 million, or $0.21 per diluted share.
Net loss for the nine month period ended December 31, 2017 was $26.9 million, or $0.16 per share, compared to net income of $91.9 million, or $0.55 per diluted share, for the nine month period ended December 31, 2016.
On December 29, 2017, AVX Corporation signed a definitive agreement to acquire Ethertronics Inc., a privately held manufacturer of passive and active antenna systems, for $142.0 million in cash and the assumption of $8.0 million of net debt, subject to normal working capital adjustments at closing. Ethertronics is a leader in advanced antenna system technology and manufactures antenna products for wireless applications such as mobile phones, Wi-Fi, defense, aerospace, medical, and IoT. The acquisition of Ethertronics is expected to close at the end of January.
Chief Financial Officer, Kurt Cummings, stated, “Part of our long-term strategy is to continue to foster our financial strength in order to allow flexibility for investments in potential acquisitions, materials, equipment and people to support the long-term growth of the Company. As of December 31, 2017, we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments in securities of approximately $1.0 billion and no debt. Additionally, the new U.S. tax law will provide greater flexibility to redirect our global cash resources where they are needed. We continued to use our resources to provide value to our stockholders during the quarter by paying $19.4 million in dividends to stockholders and spending $150.3 million for the acquisition of the S&C business.”
AVX, headquartered in Fountain Inn, South Carolina, is a leading manufacturer and supplier of a broad line of passive electronic components and related products.
