NEW YORK, Jan. 29, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- A group of shareholders of Avon Products, Inc. (NYSE: AVP) led by Shah Capital, Barington Capital Group, L.P., and NuOrion Partners that collectively beneficially owns approximately 3.5% of the outstanding common stock of the Company (the "Shareholder Group"), announced today that it has sent a letter to the Board of Directors of Avon calling on the Board to promptly retain a financial advisor to explore all strategic alternatives to maximize shareholder value, including a sale of the Company in whole or in parts.
The Shareholder Group is extremely disappointed with the deteriorating operating and share price performance that has occurred under the stewardship of the current Board. The Shareholder Group is also dismayed by the Board's failure to act quickly and decisively on the past recommendations its members have made to improve the long-term performance of the Company, including promptly hiring a new chief executive officer â€“ a step that has been long overdue and members of the Shareholder Group recommended over two years ago.
As a result, the Shareholder Group has lost confidence in the ability of Avon's current Board to create meaningful long-term value for its public shareholders, and sees no reason why shareholders should continue to wait for a turnaround from a Board that has overseen a tremendous destruction of shareholder value. The Shareholder Group therefore believes that the best course of action is for the Board to retain a financial advisor to explore the sale of the Company.
The Shareholder Group believes that Avon would be highly attractive to a range of buyers due to its many positive attributes, including its well-known 130-year old brand; its vast product offering generating over $5.7 billion in sales; its strong market positions in developing countries such as Brazil, Russia and Mexico; its owned manufacturing operations; and its six million direct sales representatives. In addition, a multinational acquirer would immediately benefit from its ability to improve Avon's capital structure and the tax efficiency of its operations. The Shareholder Group is convinced that a better capitalized strategic buyer would do a much better job of unlocking Avon's tremendous value potential than the Company's current Board.
