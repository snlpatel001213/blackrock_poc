CLEVELAND, Jan. 24, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- On January 15, 2018, Itocho announced the acquisition of Alta Forest Products, a large North American wood fencing manufacturer. The transaction will allow Itocho, a major player in the US fencing industry through its MASTER-HALCO unit, to further increase its presence in this market.
Freedonia Group analyst Nick Cunningham discusses the implications: "Prior to this acquisition, Itocho was already the leading supplier of fencing to the US through its substantial sales of a variety of metal fencing products. By adding Alta Forest Products' wood fencing operations to its portfolio, Itocho will further increase its market-leading position."
The acquisition will significantly expand Itocho's fencing operations, as the company will add Alta Forest Products' four manufacturing plants to its five existing production facilities. This should provide a considerable boost to Itocho's already substantial economies of scale.
Fencing, a study written by Cunningham, projects 5.0% annual growth in US fencing demand through 2020.
