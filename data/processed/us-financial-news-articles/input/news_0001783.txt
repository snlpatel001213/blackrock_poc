“I‘m really disappointed to withdraw from the Brisbane International,” Kvitova was Quote: d as saying on the WTA website.
”Unfortunately I picked up a virus on the flight to Australia and I haven’t been able to get healthy in time to play here.
“It’s always a fantastic and competitive place to start the year so I‘m sorry not to be in the draw.”
