Details
AudioCodes,(NASDAQ: AUDC) a leading vendor of advanced voice networking and media processing solutions for the digital workplace, today announced financial results for the fourth quarter and full year periods ended December 31, 2017.
Revenues for the fourth quarter of 2017 were $41.4 million, compared to $39.2 million for the third quarter of 2017 and $37.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. Revenues were $156.7 million in 2017 compared to $145.6 million in 2016.
Net income was $672,000, or $0.02 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $14.8 million or $0.44 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2016. Net income in 2017 was $4.0 million or $0.13 per diluted share, compared to $16.2, or $0.45 per diluted share, in 2016.
In the fourth quarter and full year of 2016, net income per diluted share included $0.34 per share and $0.32 per share, respectively, as a result of the creation of a deferred tax asset. Non-GAAP net income excludes the effect of this non-cash deferred tax benefit.
On a Non-GAAP basis, net income was $3.8 million, or $0.12 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $2.6 million, or $0.08 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter last year. Non-GAAP net income in 2017 was $12.2 million, or $0.37 per diluted share, compared to $9.4 million, or $0.26 per diluted share, in 2016.
Non-GAAP net income excludes: (i) share-based compensation expenses; (ii) amortization expenses related to intangible assets; (iii) expenses related to deferred payments and income due to revaluation of an earn-out liability, each in connection with the acquisition of Active Communications Europe; and (iv) non-cash deferred tax benefit or expenses. A reconciliation of net income on a GAAP basis to a non-GAAP basis is provided in the tables that accompany the condensed consolidated financial statements contained in this press release.
Net cash provided by operating activities was $8.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 and $17.8 million for 2017. Cash and cash equivalents, long- and short-term bank deposits and long- and short-term marketable securities were $58.7 million as of December 31, 2017 compared to $69.5 million as of December 31, 2016. The decrease in cash and cash equivalents, long- and short-term bank deposits and long- and short-term marketable securities was the result of the use of cash for the continued repurchasing of the Company's ordinary shares pursuant to its share repurchase program.
"We are pleased to report strong financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2017," said Shabtai Adlersberg, President and Chief Executive Officer of AudioCodes.
"In 2017 we executed well on our strategic goal to lead the Enterprise Voice space with voice connectivity solutions and enhanced our leadership position for coming years. We achieved record financial results and new highs in our gross margin and operating income, an attestation to our efficient operations. Looking forward, we expect to continue our evolution and growth in 2018, continuing our strong cash flow for the fourth year in a row. We also expect to continue investment in future offerings as well as focus on the return on investment to our shareholders."
"We have decided to formulate a new Business Unit called Voice.AI to follow on the steps of success of our Networking Business Unit and UC-SIP operations. Leveraging our existing operations in voice recognition and call logging/recording, Voice.AI is intended to capitalize on the endless amount of business voice interactions and resources and the growing effectiveness of AI technologies such as NLP and NLU. The newly developed Voice.AI solutions will be used to process and distribute meaningful actionable business insights. Capitalizing on our leadership position in enterprise voice and large customer base, expertise in telephony and VoIP communications, as well as our extensive product portfolio of gateways, session border controllers and end point devices and appliances, we envision significant potential for future products and solutions."
"Additionally, the ongoing trend of all-IP network transformation provides us with much to look forward to, while we work on new growth engines and new technological developments," concluded Mr. Adlersberg.

Note: Non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, the results prepared in accordance with GAAP. The Company believes that non-GAAP information is useful because it can enhance the understanding of its ongoing economic performance and therefore uses internally this non-GAAP information to evaluate and manage its operations. The Company has chosen to provide this information to investors to enable them to perform comparisons of operating results in a manner similar to how the Company analyzes its operating results and because many comparable companies report this type of information.
