SAN FRANCISCO, Jan. 25, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- YouCaring , the world's trusted leader in free crowdfunding for personal, medical, and charitable causes, and Indiegogo, entrepreneurs to move their ideas quickly from concept to market, today announced that they have entered a long-term agreement for YouCaring to become the company's exclusive charitable crowdfunding partner. As part of the partnership, YouCaring has acquired Indiegogo's personal crowdfunding service, Generosity.com , and Indiegogo will become YouCaring's partner for entrepreneurial fundraising.
YouCaring also announced that it has raised over $1 billion to date for medical and charitable causes from more than ten million donors around the world, to which it now adds the almost $100 million raised by Generosity.com (known as Indiegogo Life when it launched in 2014).
"With this partnership, YouCaring is becoming the go-to platform for personal, medical, and charitable crowdfunding," said, YouCaring CEO Dan Saper. "We pioneered free online crowdfunding for personal causes when we launched in 2011, and we will always be free for our members. Our core focus is providing financial, social, and emotional relief to people facing hardship."
In 2017, YouCaring acquired GiveForward , one of the top crowdfunding platforms for medical causes. YouCaring's exponential growth this past year was fueled by Americans' increasing need for financial support from their communities. Squeezed between ballooning medical costs and reduced government support for healthcare, Americans rely more than ever on crowdfunding to cover expenses for unexpected life events and illnesses. Campaigns that raise money to cover medical expenses make up the largest and fastest-growing category of fundraisers on YouCaring.
"We're thrilled to partner with YouCaring and we think this is a great solution for our users who are looking to fundraise for a personal cause," said David Mandelbrot, Indiegogo's CEO. "We're proud to join forces with such a trusted brand in charitable crowdfunding, while enabling us to continue to focus on best serving the rapidly growing number of entrepreneurs that use Indiegogo to launch a business."
Beginning February 1, Indiegogo and YouCaring will integrate their charitable crowdfunding experiences. New fundraisers will launch on YouCaring and benefit from YouCaring's real-time support, while existing Generosity.com fundraisers will be able to continue collecting donations on the platform through March 2018.
