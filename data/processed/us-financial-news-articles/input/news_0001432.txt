The governor of Colorado sees a unique selling point in Denver's bid for Amazon 's second headquarters: the same "can-do" western attitude as the e-commerce giant. 
"Look at how Denver and Colorado have recreated ourselves in the last 10 or 15 years as the most pro-business state in America," Governor John Hickenlooper told CNBC's " Power Lunch " Wednesday. 
Hickenlooper, for his part, founded a Denver-based brewery and is considered a pro-business Democrat. But his state's bid for a new Amazon headquarters is comparatively light on tax incentives. 
"We're never going to offer $7 billion of incentives," Hickenlooper said, referencing a high-priced bid from New Jersey . 
"This is one of the most desired locations for young professionals in America," he said. "And over the long term, that's going to be much more powerful — whether [Amazon gets] a puny billion dollars here or billion dollars there." 
Hickenlooper touted the state's universities, engineering talent and commitment to the environment — just a few of the positive factors that bumped Denver to a C+ grade on CNBC's report card . 
The commonly cited drawbacks — crumbling infrastructure, chief among them — are actively seeing improvement, he said.
