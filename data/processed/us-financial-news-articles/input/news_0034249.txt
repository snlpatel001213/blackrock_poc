Jan 19 (Reuters) - Wall Street was set to open slightly higher on Friday as investors bet on strong corporate earnings, while playing down fears of a potential U.S. government shutdown.
The U.S. House of Representatives passed a bill on Thursday to fund government operations through to Feb. 16 and avoid agency shutdowns this weekend when existing allocations expire. The bill has yet to be approved by the Senate, where it faces an uncertain future.
Equity investors have taken such incidents in stride, and their reactions have been largely muted during the past three shutdowns.
“Naturally there are concerns, the House has a deal and the Senate maybe an issue. But investors are betting something will get done to avert a shutdown,” said Andre Bakhos, managing director at New Vines Capital LLC in Bernardsville, New Jersey.
“But if indeed nothing gets done, it will cause a hiccup in the market.”
