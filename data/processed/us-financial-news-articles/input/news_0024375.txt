VANCOUVER, Jan. 16, 2018 /PRNewswire/ - Amerigo Resources Ltd. ("Amerigo" or the "Company") (TSX: ARG) announced today production results for the year 2017 and Q4-2017 from Minera Valle Central ("MVC"), the Company's 100% owned operation located near Rancagua, Chile.
Operational Highlights:
In 2017, MVC produced record quantities of copper and molybdenum. MVC produced 62.5 million pounds of copper at a cash cost of $1.64 per pound, pursuant to a tolling agreement with Codelco's Division El Teniente. Annual molybdenum production was 1.6 million pounds.
The Company's robust performance met its 2017 guidance of production of 60 to 65 million pounds of copper at a cash cost of $1.60 to $1.75 per pound, and exceeded guidance of production of 1.5 million pounds of molybdenum.
In Q4-2017, MVC produced 15.6 million pounds of copper at a cash cost of $1.66 per pound, and 0.4 million pounds of molybdenum.
Construction of MVC's Cauquenes Phase Two expansion is on track for completion in Q3-2018, with full production expected in Q4-2018. The project will increase MVC's production to 85 to 90 million pounds per year, at an estimated cash cost of $1.45 to $1.60 per pound.
In 2018, Amerigo expects to produce 65 to 70 million pounds of copper and 1.8 million pounds of molybdenum, at a cash cost of $1.45 to $1.60 per pound.
Rob Henderson, Amerigo's President and CEO, stated "MVC performed strongly again in 2017. The completion of the Cauquenes expansion in the second half of the year will increase production and lower unit costs, enabling Amerigo to further benefit from improved copper prices expected in 2018."
