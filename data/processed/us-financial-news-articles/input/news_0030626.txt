Commenting on the results, Mr. Krishna Bodanapu, MD & CEO , said, "Q3 FY18 was in line with our expectations both in revenue and margin. We are coming off a strong quarter in Q2 and Q3 is a seasonally weak quarter due to lower working days. Despite this we recorded the highest ever revenue of $152 Mn in the quarter, an increase of 11.9% YoY and 1.3% QoQ. Our services business recorded a revenue of $139.9 Mn an increase of 4.2% QoQ. The growth in our services business was driven by Utilities & Geospatial (U&G), Transportation, Industrial, Energy and Natural Resources (IENR) and Aerospace business units. The Design Led Manufacturing (DLM) business recorded a de-growth of 23.2% due to pushout of an order to Q4. Our operating margin for the quarter stood at 14.6%, an increase of 116 bps YoY & flat QoQ. The services OPM at 15.7% is lower by 51 bps QoQ and higher by 93 bps YoY.

This quarter we also received two prestigious Pratt & Whitney 2017 Awards, Supplier Innovation Award for the 5th year in row and the Higher Productivity Award for the 2nd year in a row.
Our outlook for FY 18 is strong, backed by a strong pipeline and order backlog. We expect a double digit growth in our services business while DLM business is expected to grow around 20%. Our margin will improve by 50 bps driven by improvement in operational efficiency through the year. We expect to deliver double digit earnings growth in the year.
Mr. Ajay Aggarwal, President & CFO , said, "I am pleased to share that during Q3 FY18, we saw a well-rounded growth both across top line which grew 11.9% YoY and 1.3% QoQ despite headwind of furloughs, operating margin at 14.6% expanding 116 basis points YoY and flat sequentially despite higher pay days in Q3 FY 18. The focus on operating profit has shown good results with 16.5% growth YoY. This quarter the Free Cash to EBITDA stood at a robust ~67% culminating into a highest ever cash balance of $168 Mn. We completed the sale of IASI to Pratt & Whitney, which generated a net cash receipt of $9 Mn. We also declared a second interim dividend of Rs. 4/ share. We continue to focus on organic and inorganic strategic investments. We expect the momentum to continue for the rest of FY18.
