Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi , Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff , WPP CEO Martin Sorrell and Rachel Botsman, academic at the University of Oxford, spoke to CNBC's Andrew Sorkin at the World Economic Forum's annual meeting in Davos , Switzerland, on Tuesday.
"In Technology We Trust?" was a panel examining how technology is impacting the modern world.
Business culture at technology firms took center stage, with Khosrowshahi saying that the multiple scandals Uber has faced in recent months would ultimately help it "go forward as a company that does the right thing."
Data leaks and sexual harassment whistleblowing at the company "started a real cultural change that was painful for Uber but incredibly positive," he said.
Meanwhile, Benioff weighed in on the importance of public trust in technology companies. "What is the most important to you. Is it trust or is it growth? Because if anything trumps trust, then you are in trouble," he said.
