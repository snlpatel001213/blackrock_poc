WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump, responding to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un saying he had a nuclear button on his desk, said in a tweet on Tuesday that his nuclear button “is a much bigger & more powerful one than his, and my Button works!”
In a televised speech on Monday, Kim said “the entire United States is within range of our nuclear weapons, and a nuclear button is always on my desk. This is reality, not a threat.”
