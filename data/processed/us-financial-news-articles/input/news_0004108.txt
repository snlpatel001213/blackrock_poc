LONDON (Reuters) - Buoyed by a recovery in equity issuance, global investment banking fees rose 16 percent to an estimated $104 billion in 2017, Thomson Reuters data shows, the highest level since its records began in 2000. 
The rebound in fees to above pre-crisis highs will be welcome news for global advisors who complain they are being squeezed by regulatory requirements amid competition from boutique players. 
Following a downbeat 2016, investment banking fees for equity products rose 41.5 percent to $22 billion (Â£16.23 billion) on an issuance recovery. Fees for bonds beat mergers and acquisitions as the number one product, rising almost 15 percent to $31 billion. 
Japan Post Holdings Co Ltd ( 6178.T ), the biggest follow-on offering of the year, and Japanese SoftBank Group Corp ( 9984.T ), which agreed to buy a large number of shares of Uber Technologies Inc in late December, were the biggest corporate clients of 2017 - paying out $382 and $378 million respectively. 
Japan saw a 50 percent rise in total fees to $5.5 billion. 
Blackstone Group ( BX.N ) was the biggest financial sponsor fee payer, shelling out $679 million, an increase of 87 percent on the previous year. 
JP Morgan ( JPM.N ) was the biggest global investment banking earner of the year once again, racking up an estimated $6.7 billion in fees, or 6 percent of the total. Reporting by Dasha Afanasieva; Editing by Adrian Croft
