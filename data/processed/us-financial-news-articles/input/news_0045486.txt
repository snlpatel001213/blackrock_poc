VISALIA, Calif., Jan. 25, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Suncrest Bank (OTCQX: SBKK) today reported unaudited financial results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2017.
On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ("Tax Act") was signed into law, reducing the federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018. As a result, and in accordance with GAAP, the Company revalued its net deferred tax asset as of December 31, 2017. This resulted in a one-time reduction in the value of our net deferred tax asset of $1.3 million or $0.18 per diluted share, recorded as additional income tax expense in the fourth quarter.
"2017 was an outstanding year in terms of organic balance sheet growth," said Ciaran McMullan, President and CEO of Suncrest Bank. "We finished the year with approximately $530 million in total assets, an 18.2% increase over the previous year, while total deposits increased by 20.0% and total loans by 14.9%."
"Our pre "Tax Act" net income set new records of $4.7 million for the full year and $1.4 million for the quarter, resulting in diluted EPS (1) for the year of 65 cents, a year-over year increase of over 90%."
McMullan added, "Our anticipated merger with Community Business Bank is progressing extremely well and we are excited by the opportunities that will come with a significantly expanded presence in the Greater Sacramento and Lodi markets."

Income Statement
The comparability of fourth quarter net income to the same quarter last year, and the linked quarter, is impacted by the one-time impact of tax expense associated with the "Tax Act", non-recurring costs associated with our acquisition of Security First Bank, and non-recurring income due to the recognition of fair value discount accretion on acquired loans.

Core net income for the quarter, which excludes all non-recurring items, was a record $1.29 million or $0.18 per diluted share compared with core net income of $0.55 million or $0.11 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2016, and $1.05 million or $0.15 for the linked quarter. Core net interest income for the quarter was $5.1 million, an increase of $1.7 million or 50.3% over the same quarter last year.
Non-interest income for the quarter was $0.29 million, an increase of 23.9% over the same quarter last year while non-interest income for the full year was $1.36 million, an increase of 22.9% over the full year 2016. Full year 2017 non-interest income includes $0.28 million in income generated through the gain on sale of a number of government guaranteed loans. This gain on sale income was $0.29 million lower than the full year 2016. While we currently have a number of these loans available for sale, we chose to hold them on balance sheet, which largely explains the difference between gain on sale income from 2016 and 2017.
Non-interest expense for the quarter was $3.33 million, a decrease of approximately $44,000 or 1.3% compared to the fourth quarter of 2016, and an increase of approximately $142,000 compared to the linked quarter. This increase is largely explained by $130,000 in non-recurring costs associated with our upcoming merger.
Core net interest margin (NIM), which removes accretion of loan fair value marks and non-recurring items such as recovery of interest, was 4.10% for the quarter, an increase of 13 basis points from the same quarter last year. This improvement was driven primarily by a lower cost of funds and improved return on our investment securities. Our Core NIM declined by 11 basis points when compared to the linked quarter driven by average loans being a lower percentage of average earnings assets in the last quarter.
Balance Sheet
Total assets declined by $0.4 million during the quarter and have increased, year over year, by $81.3 million, or 18.2%. Total deposits declined during the quarter by approximately $0.5 million, or 0.1%, although this reflects the net impact of an increase in non-maturity deposits of approximately $3.0 million and a decline in time deposits of approximately $3.6 million. Total deposits have increased by $77.9 million or 20% year over year. This outstanding growth reflects our focus on lower cost core deposits. Non-maturity deposits have increased by $93.0 million or 30.5% over the prior year, while time deposits declined by $15.1 million, or 17.9%. Our cost of funds has declined by 3 basis points when comparing this quarter to the same quarter last year.
Total loans increased by $5.9 million during the quarter, or 1.7%, and new loan originations together with new unfunded commitments during the quarter were approximately $17 million. Commercial real estate loans (both owner and non-owner occupied) increased by $8.5 million or 6.3%, and were well distributed across various real estate sectors. Construction and land development loans declined by $4.7 million, or 27.7%, due to the completion of a number of commercial construction loans, which we transitioned to permanent financing. Loans to finance agricultural production declined by $1.3 million, which is the net result of pay downs of 2017 harvest lines and initial draws of our 2018 lines.
At December 31, 2017, commercial and industrial loans were $39.2 million or 11.1% or total loans, loans secured by farmland and loans to finance agricultural production were $94.7 million or 26.8%, and loans secured by real estate (excluding farmland) were $219.2 million or 62.0%.
At December 31, 2016, commercial and industrial loans were $47.3 million or 15.4% of total loans, loans secured by farmland and loans to finance agricultural production were $71.3 million or 23.2%, and loans secured by real estate (excluding farmland) were $188.6 million or 61.3%

Total loans have grown by $45.9 million or 14.9% over the previous year with 100% of this growth sourced locally through direct local business relationships rather than through purchased participations or loan pool investments.
Asset Quality
Non-performing assets were $0.97 million or 0.18% of total assets at December 31, 2017 compared with $1.95 million or 0.37% of total assets at September 30, 2017. This decrease was primarily due to the full pay off of one non-accrual loan relationship and the upgrade of an additional non-accrual loan.
The company did not record any additional loan loss provision during the fourth quarter, and the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans, excluding acquired loans that have been marked to fair value, was 1.27% at December 31, 2017 (including $246,000 in specific reserves) compared to 1.27% at September 30, 2017.
Capital
Suncrest Bank remained well capitalized at December 31, 2017. All of the Bank's capital ratios are above minimum regulatory standards for "well capitalized" institutions.
At December 31, 2017 the tangible book value per common share was $8.02 with common shares issued of 7,007,594 as of the same date. This compares to a tangible book value per common share of $8.03 at September 30, 2017 and $7.83 at June 30, 2017. The decline in tangible book value per share of $0.01 from the linked quarter is primarily explained by the one-time impact of tax expense associated with the "Tax Act." The bank has only common shares on issue.
