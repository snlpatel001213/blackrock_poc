DETROIT, Jan. 3, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- ComForCare Health Care Holdings LLC has named Steven Greenbaum as the home care franchisor's new CEO. Greenbaum will serve as co-CEO with ComForCare and At Your Side Home Care founder Mark Armstrong during a brief transition period, after which Armstrong will become chairman of the board.
ComForCare, which has 200 franchised locations in the U.S., Canada and the U.K., conducted a national search for a new CEO before selecting Greenbaum to execute its strategic growth plan. Last year, The Riverside Company invested in ComForCare to gain entry into the home care industry, a space that is experiencing significant growth. In fact, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, the number of people aged 65 and older is expected to reach 70 million by 2030, and the AARP says 87 percent of those older adults want to stay in their own homes as they age.
As founder and former CEO of PostNet, Greenbaum developed a 660-unit global printing and marketing services franchise and brings nearly 25 years of accomplishments in growing and supporting a successful franchise system. He is recognized as a thought leader and innovator throughout the franchise industry. Greenbaum is a Certified Franchise Executive, served as chairman of the International Franchise Association (IFA) in 2008 and was honored with the IFA's Entrepreneur of the Year Award in 2003. He was also featured in season four of CBS's "Undercover Boss."
"Steve brings superb credentials, with the skills to grow our franchise system and bring ComForCare's high standards for compassionate in-home care to more families and communities," said Armstrong. "As ComForCare's chairman of the board, I will continue to support the company's mission, its franchisees and our growth within the industry."
"Mark is a visionary who saw the growing need for in-home care more than 20 years ago and has well positioned ComForCare as a premier provider," said Greenbaum. "With a strong franchise system and a trusted name in home care, we believe ComForCare is poised for growth as families look to help their aging loved ones live their best life possible."
