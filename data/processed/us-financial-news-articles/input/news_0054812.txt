The foregoing conversion right is subject to the conditions that: (i) if Enbridge determines that there would be less than 1,000,000 Series D Shares outstanding after March 1, 2018, then all remaining Series D Shares will automatically be converted into Series E Shares on a one-for-one basis on March 1, 2018; and (ii) alternatively, if Enbridge determines that there would be less than 1,000,000 Series E Shares outstanding after March 1, 2018, no Series D Shares will be converted into Series E Shares. There are currently 18,000,000 Series D Shares outstanding.
With respect to any Series D Shares that remain outstanding after March 1, 2018, holders thereof will be entitled to receive quarterly fixed cumulative preferential cash dividends, as and when declared by the Board of Directors of Enbridge. The new annual dividend rate applicable to the Series D Shares for the five-year period commencing on March 1, 2018 to, but excluding, March 1, 2023 will be 4.46 percent, being equal to the five-year Government of Canada bond yield of 2.09 percent determined as of today plus 2.37 percent in accordance with the terms of the Series D Shares.
With respect to any Series E Shares that may be issued on March 1, 2018, holders thereof will be entitled to receive quarterly floating rate cumulative preferential cash dividends, as and when declared by the Board of Directors of Enbridge. The dividend rate applicable to the Series E Shares for the three-month floating rate period commencing on March 1, 2018 to, but excluding, June 1, 2018 will be 0.89984 percent, based on the annual rate on three month Government of Canada treasury bills for the most recent treasury bills auction of 1.20 percent plus 2.37 percent in accordance with the terms of the Series E Shares (the Floating Quarterly Dividend Rate).
