EAST AURORA, N.Y., Jan. 26, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Moog Inc. (NYSE:MOG.A) (NYSE:MOG.B) announced today financial results for the first quarter ended December 30, 2017.
First Quarter Highlights
Sales of $628 million, up 6%; Operating margins of 10.6%, up from 8.9% a year ago; Non-GAAP adjusted diluted earnings per share, excluding the impacts of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act), was $.93, up 11% from a year ago; Diluted earnings per share of $.04, including the impacts of the Tax Act; $44 million cash flow from operating activities.
Segment Results
Total Aircraft Controls segment sales in the quarter were $279 million, up 4% year over year. Commercial aircraft revenues increased 10%, to $154 million. Sales of OEM products to Airbus increased 14%, driven by strong A350 sales. Boeing OEM product sales were mostly unchanged, at $61 million. Commercial aftermarket sales increased 27%, to $34 million, on strong A350 initial provisioning spares.
Military aircraft sales in the quarter were $124 million, down 3% from a year ago. Military OEM sales were 2% higher, at $82 million. Military aftermarket sales were down 10%, attributed to lower B-2 and V-22 activity, due to the timing of orders and deliveries.
In the quarter, Space and Defense segment sales were $133 million, up 9% year over year. Defense sales were 11% higher on strong sales into military vehicle applications in the U.S and Europe. Space sales were 5% higher, partly due to increased sales of satellite avionics products.
Industrial System segment sales in the quarter were $216 million, up 9% from last year. Sales were higher in the four major markets served with particularly strong sales in industrial automation. Higher simulation and test sales reflected increases in auto and aerospace test systems. Energy products were up on sales of exploration and power generation products. Medical sales were higher for a variety of OEM components.
Consolidated 12-month backlog was $1.3 billion.
Fiscal 2018 Outlook
The Company updated its projections for fiscal 2018.
Forecasted sales of $2.62 billion, up 5%, unchanged from 90 days ago; Forecasted full-year operating margins of 11.0%, unchanged from 90 days ago; Non-GAAP full-year adjusted diluted earnings per share of $4.10, plus or minus $0.20, unchanged from 90 days ago, excluding the impacts of the Tax Act; GAAP forecasted range for full-year earnings per share is $3.43, plus or minus $0.20, including the impacts of the Tax Act; Forecast cash flow from operations, including incremental accelerated pension contributions, of $180 million;
“The quarter got us off to a good start for the year,” said John Scannell, Chairman and CEO. “Earnings per share was above our guidance and we’re pleased to affirm our operating projections from 90 days ago. The recent Tax Act changes resulted in a one-time charge for us in the quarter but we’ll see benefits longer-term.”

the markets we serve are cyclical and sensitive to domestic and foreign economic conditions and events, which may cause our operating results to fluctuate; we operate in highly competitive markets with competitors who may have greater resources than we possess; we depend heavily on government contracts that may not be fully funded or may be terminated, and the failure to receive funding or the termination of one or more of these contracts could reduce our sales and increase our costs; we make estimates in accounting for long-term contracts, and changes in these estimates may have significant impacts on our earnings; we enter into fixed-price contracts, which could subject us to losses if we have cost overruns; we may not realize the full amounts reflected in our backlog as revenue, which could adversely affect our future revenue and growth prospects; if our subcontractors or suppliers fail to perform their contractual obligations, our prime contract performance and our ability to obtain future business could be materially and adversely impacted; contracting on government programs is subject to significant regulation, including rules related to bidding, billing and accounting kickbacks and false claims, and any non-compliance could subject us to fines and penalties or possible debarment; the loss of The Boeing Company as a customer or a significant reduction in sales to The Boeing Company could adversely impact our operating results; our new product research and development efforts may not be successful which could reduce our sales and earnings; our inability to adequately enforce and protect our intellectual property or defend against assertions of infringement could prevent or restrict our ability to compete; our business operations may be adversely affected by information systems interruptions, intrusions or new software implementations; our indebtedness and restrictive covenants under our credit facilities could limit our operational and financial flexibility; significant changes in discount rates, rates of return on pension assets, mortality tables and other factors could adversely affect our earnings and equity and increase our pension funding requirements; a write-off of all or part of our goodwill or other intangible assets could adversely affect our operating results and net worth; our sales and earnings may be affected if we cannot identify, acquire or integrate strategic acquisitions, or if we engage in divesting activities; our operations in foreign countries expose us to political and currency risks and adverse changes in local legal and regulatory environments; unforeseen exposure to additional income tax liabilities may affect our operating results; government regulations could limit our ability to sell our products outside the United States and otherwise adversely affect our business; the failure or misuse of our products may damage our reputation, necessitate a product recall or result in claims against us that exceed our insurance coverage, thereby requiring us to pay significant damages; future terror attacks, war, natural disasters or other catastrophic events beyond our control could negatively impact our business; our operations are subject to environmental laws, and complying with those laws may cause us to incur significant costs; and we are involved in various legal proceedings, the outcome of which may be unfavorable to us.
