United States: U.S. to retry Senator Menendez on bribery, corruption charges January 22nd, 2018 Americas

The government is seeking the “earliest possible date” for a retrial, according to a court filing. Menendez, who has represented New Jersey in the Senate since 2006, is expected to run for another six-year term this year, and the state’s Democratic leaders have endorsed his bid despite the charges. 
“The decision to retry this case was made based on the facts and the law, following a careful review,” the Justice Department said in a statement.
