WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States has “ample authorities” to hold accountable those who commit violence against, censor or steal from Iranian protesters, the State Department said on Thursday.
In a statement, the department said it condemns deaths and arrests related to the Iranian protests in the “strongest possible terms.”
“To the regime’s victims, we say: You will not be forgotten,” it added.
