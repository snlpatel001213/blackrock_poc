BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Western European car sales are likely to grow by about 0.8 percent in 2018, the European Automobile Manufacturers Association (ACEA) said on Wednesday.
This represented a slow down from 2017. In the European Union as a whole, new passenger car registrations rose 3.4 percent in 2017, the fourth consecutive year of growth, reaching more than 15 million vehicles for the first time since 2007.
