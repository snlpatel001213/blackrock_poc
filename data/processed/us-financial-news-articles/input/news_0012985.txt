PRAGUE (Reuters) - The Czech lower house voted on Wednesday to adjourn a session due to hold a confidence vote on a minority government led by Prime Minister Andrej Babis until Jan. 16. 
Babis, a billionaire businessman and leader of the anti-establishment ANO party, was expected to lose the vote after other factions in parliament said they would not back the cabinet due to a police investigation of alleged subsidy fraud by Babis. He denies any wrongdoing. Reporting by Petra Vodstrcilova; Writing by Jan Lopatka; Editing by Hugh Lawson
