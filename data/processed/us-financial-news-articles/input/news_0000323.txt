Turnover stood at 194.6 million rupees ($1.27 million), less than last year’s daily average of 915.3 million rupees. 
“It was a typical first day of the new year with the volumes low. But the market is positive after the central bank kept the rates lower and the market rates are coming down,” said Hussain Gani, deputy CEO at Softlogic Stockbrokers. 
The bourse rose 2.26 percent in 2017, posting the first annual increase in three years, after falling 9.7 percent in 2016.
