Chris Tierney had a goal and an assist for his fourth multi-point performance of the season, and the San Jose Sharks held on for a 4-1 win over the Los Angeles Kings on Monday afternoon at Staples Center.
Barclay Goodrow, Mikkel Boedker and Joe Thornton also scored for the Sharks, who won their second consecutive game. San Jose improved to 3-1-0 against the Kings in the final meeting of the regular season between the teams.
Trevor Lewis scored the Kings’ lone goal. Los Angeles lost its fourth game in a row, matching its worst streak of the season.
Sharks goaltender Martin Jones stopped 35 of 36 shots to improve to 14-10-4. He is 9-3-2 against the Kings in his career.
Kings goaltender Darcy Kuemper allowed three goals on 32 shots to draw his first loss in regulation time in nine starts this season. Kuemper (5-1-3) made his first start since Dec. 16 while No. 1 netminder Jonathan Quick received the day off.
San Jose opened the scoring 4:38 into the first period. Joonas Donskoi took control of a loose puck near the crease and spun left. He slipped a pass across the slot to Tierney, who punched in his 11th goal of the season and his third in the past five games.
The Sharks made it 2-0 midway through the second period when Goodrow notched his third goal of the season and his first since Dec. 7. The 24-year-old scored on a rebound after defenseman Dylan DeMelo fired a shot on goal from near the blue line.
Los Angeles’ comeback hopes faded when San Jose increased its lead to 3-0 with 10:49 to go in the third period. Boedker scored on a backhanded shot for his fourth goal of the season. He needs two more goals for 100 in his career.
The Kings trimmed the deficit to 3-1 with 7:18 remaining in the third period. Lewis flipped a wrist shot into the back of the net for his 11th goal, which moved him within one goal of matching his career high, set last season.
Thornton finished the scoring with an empty-net goal in the final minute.
