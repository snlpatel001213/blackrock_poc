SAN JOSE, Calif., FICO (NYSE:FICO), a leading predictive analytics and decision management software company, today announced results for its first fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2017.
First Quarter Fiscal 2018 GAAP Results
Net income for the quarter totaled $27.3 million, or $0.86 per share, versus $37.9 million, or $1.16 per share, reported in the prior year period.
The current quarter earnings include a charge of $11.8 million, or $0.37 per share, related to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in December 2017. The charge encompasses several elements, including a tax on the deemed repatriation of previously untaxed accumulated earnings and profits of its foreign subsidiaries, and the remeasurement of its deferred tax assets arising from a lower U.S. corporate tax rate. In addition, the company recorded a reduction to income tax expense of $11.5 million, or $0.36 per share, related to excess tax benefits associated with stock compensation.
Net cash provided by operating activities for the quarter was $28.8 million versus $33.0 million in the prior year period.
First Quarter Fiscal 2018 Non-GAAP Results
Non-GAAP Net Income for the quarter was $41.1 million vs. $33.5 million in the prior year period. Non-GAAP EPS for the quarter was $1.30 vs. $1.03 in the prior year period. Free cash flow for the quarter was $24.7 million vs. $28.0 million in the prior year period. The Non-GAAP financial measures are described in the financial table captioned "Non-GAAP Results" and are reconciled to the corresponding GAAP results in the financial tables at the end of this release.
First Quarter Fiscal 2018 GAAP Revenues
The company reported revenues of $235.3 million for the quarter as compared to $219.6 million reported in the prior year period.
"We're off to a good start in 2018, as we continue to expand our recurring revenue base," said Will Lansing, chief executive officer. "Our Scores segment is performing particularly well, as we drive growth in both B2B and B2C."
Revenues for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 across each of the company's three operating segments were as follows:
Applications revenues, which include the company's preconfigured decision management applications and associated professional services, were $141.4 million in the first quarter compared to $134.8 million in the prior year quarter, an increase of 5%, due primarily to increased transactional revenue in Customer Communications Services. Scores revenues, which include the company's business-to-business (B2B) scoring solutions and associated professional services as well as business-to-consumer (B2C) service, were $69.9 million in the first quarter compared to $59.4 million in the prior year quarter, an increase of 18%. B2B revenue increased 13% and B2C revenue increased 27% from the prior year quarter. Decision Management Software revenues, which include Blaze Advisor ® , Xpress Optimization and related professional services, were $24.0 million in the first quarter compared to $25.4 million in the prior year quarter, a decrease of 6%, due primarily to decreased license sales of Blaze Advisor ® .

About Non-GAAP Financial Measures
To supplement the consolidated GAAP financial statements, the company uses the following non-GAAP financial measures: non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP EPS, and free cash flow. Non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS exclude the impact of amortization expense, share-based compensation expense, restructuring and acquisition-related, excess tax benefit, and adjustment to tax valuation allowance items. Free cash flow excludes capital expenditures and dividends paid. The presentation of these financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP.
Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. Our management believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance and liquidity by excluding certain items that may not be indicative of recurring business results including significant non-cash expenses. We believe management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our performance when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management's internal comparisons to historical performance and liquidity as well as comparisons to our competitors' operating results. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors because they allow for greater transparency with respect to key measures used by management in its financial and operating decision-making.
