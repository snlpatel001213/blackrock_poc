I am surprised that recent discussions about charitable giving (“The Tax Bill Won’t Hurt Charitable Giving,” Letters, Jan. 2) haven’t included a reminder about the required minimum distributions from qualified IRAs for those over age 70-and-a-half. Who cares about the deduction when you can lower your adjusted gross income, and with the increased standard deduction, continue to claim a deduction?
