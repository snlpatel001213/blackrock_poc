WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican Senator Orrin Hatch, the chairman of the tax-writing Senate Finance Committee, said on Tuesday he would retire at the end of his current term, opening the door to a potential Senate bid by former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney, the party’s 2012 presidential nominee. 
“Every good fighter knows when to hang up the gloves. And for me, that time is soon approaching,” Hatch said in a video statement posted to Twitter. “That’s why after much prayer and discussion with family and friends, I’ve decided to retire at the end of this term.”
