TOKYO, Jan 10 (Reuters) - Japan’s Nikkei share average took a breather on Wednesday after sharp gains, with some index-heavy stocks losing ground after the index hit a 26-year high. 
The Nikkei fell 0.3 percent to 23,798.90, staying slightly below its 26-year high of 23,952.61. 
Index-heavy stocks such as chip equipment maker Tokyo Electron tumbled 2.0 percent and clothing store operator Fast Retailing shed 0.8 percent, contributing 30 negative points together to the Nikkei index.

Yields on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note reached a 10-month high on Tuesday, after the Bank of Japan said it will trim its purchases of Japanese government bonds and U.S. corporate debt.
