ADEN (Reuters) - At least 11 people were killed on Tuesday in a suicide car bomb attack on a checkpoint in southeastern Yemen run by local forces backed by the United Arab Emirates, officials and residents said. 
Residents said gunmen opened fire on the checkpoint after a suicide bomber drove his booby-trapped car into the checkpoint northeast of Ataq, the capital of the province of Shabwa. They said at least 12 people were killed. Reporting by Mohammed Mukhashaf; Writing Sami Aboudi; Editing by Paul Tait
