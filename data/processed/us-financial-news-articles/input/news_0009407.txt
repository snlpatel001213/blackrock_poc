The decision came within hours of a shock 2-1 defeat in the FA Cup third round by Coventry City, three leagues below them. 
“We would like to thank Mark for all he has achieved for the Club over the last four and a half years, notably in guiding us to three successive ninth place finishes in the Premier League, and we wish him every success for the future,” a club statement said. 
“The Club will look to appoint a new manager as soon as possible and will be making no further comment at this time.” 
Stoke have dropped into the relegation places in the Premier League and have now lost six of their last eight games in all competitions. Reporting by Steve Tongue; Editing by Christian Radnedge
