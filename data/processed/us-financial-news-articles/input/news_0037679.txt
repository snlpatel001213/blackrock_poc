ABBOTT PARK, Ill., Jan. 24, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Abbott (NYSE: ABT) today announced financial results for the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, 2017.
Fourth-quarter worldwide sales of $7.6 billion increased 42.3 percent on a reported basis and 7.7 percent on a comparable operational * basis. Reported diluted EPS from continuing operations under GAAP was a $(0.50) loss in the fourth quarter, primarily due to the net expense of $1.46 billion for the estimated 1 impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (U.S. tax reform). Excluding the impact of U.S. tax reform and other specified items, adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations was $0.74 in the fourth quarter, at the high end of the previous guidance range of $0.72 to $0.74. Abbott issues full-year 2018 guidance for diluted EPS from continuing operations on a GAAP basis of $1.22 to $1.32. Projected full-year adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations is $2.80 to $2.90, reflecting 14.0 percent growth 2 at the midpoint. In October, Abbott received U.S. FDA clearance for its Confirm Rx™ Insertable Cardiac Monitor (ICM), the world's first and only smartphone-compatible ICM designed to help physicians remotely identify cardiac arrhythmias, and obtained CE Mark for XIENCE Sierra™, the newest generation of the company's gold-standard XIENCE everolimus-eluting coronary stent system. In November, Abbott initiated the U.S. launch of FreeStyle ® Libre, the only continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) system available that comes factory-calibrated and removes the need for routine fingersticks 3 for people with diabetes. In January, Abbott announced that FreeStyle Libre is now available and approved for coverage by the U.S. Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS). In December, Abbott received U.S. FDA approval for magnetic resonance (MR)-conditional labeling for its Quadra Assura™ and Quadra Assura MP™ cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillator (CRT-D) devices and its Fortify Assura™ implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD). With these approvals, Abbott has MR-conditional labeling for its full suite of pacemaker, ICD and CRT-D devices.
"2017 was a great year for us – we performed well, our new product pipeline was highly productive and we took some very important strategic steps forward," said Miles D. White, chairman and chief executive officer, Abbott. "We're entering 2018 with very good momentum."

Worldwide Diagnostics sales increased 51.7 percent on a reported basis in the fourth quarter. On a comparable operational basis, sales increased 6.7 percent. Refer to tables titled "Non-GAAP Reconciliation of Comparable Historical Revenue" for a reconciliation of comparable historical revenue.
Core Laboratory Diagnostics sales increased 9.4 percent on a reported basis in the fourth quarter, including a favorable 2.2 percent effect of foreign exchange, and increased 7.2 percent on an operational basis, reflecting continued above-market growth driven by share gains globally.
Molecular Diagnostics sales increased 4.2 percent on a reported basis in the fourth quarter, including a favorable 1.8 percent effect of foreign exchange, and increased 2.4 percent on an operational basis. As expected, growth in infectious disease testing, Abbott's core area of focus in the molecular diagnostics market, was partially offset by a planned scale down in other testing areas, primarily in the U.S.
Point of Care Diagnostics sales increased 7.2 percent on a reported basis in the fourth quarter, including a favorable 0.4 percent effect of foreign exchange, and increased 6.8 percent on an operational basis, led by continued adoption of Abbott's i-STAT ® handheld system.
Rapid Diagnostics sales of $540 million were led by infectious disease testing, including flu and strep testing.

Worldwide Medical Devices sales increased 102.2 percent on a reported basis in the fourth quarter. On a comparable operational basis, sales increased 9.6 percent. Refer to tables titled "Non-GAAP Reconciliation of Comparable Historical Revenue" for a reconciliation of comparable historical revenue.
In Cardiovascular and Neuromodulation, worldwide sales in the fourth quarter were led by double-digit growth in Electrophysiology, Heart Failure, Structural Heart and Neuromodulation. In Electrophysiology, during the fourth quarter, Abbott initiated the U.S. launch of its Confirm Rx Insertable Cardiac Monitor (ICM), the world's first and only smartphone-compatible ICM designed to help physicians remotely identify cardiac arrhythmias. Growth in Structural Heart was driven by MitraClip ® , Abbott's market-leading device for the minimally-invasive treatment of mitral regurgitation. In Heart Failure, sales growth was led by market uptake of Abbott's HeartMate 3™ system, which received U.S. FDA approval in the third quarter of 2017. In Neuromodulation, strong double-digit growth was led by several recently launched products for the treatment of chronic pain and movement disorders.
In the fourth quarter, in Rhythm Management, Abbott received U.S. FDA approval for MR-conditional labeling for its Quadra Assura and Quadra Assura MP cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillator (CRT-D) devices and its Fortify Assura implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD). In Vascular, Abbott obtained CE Mark for its XIENCE Sierra drug-eluting coronary stent system, which enhances its competitive position in this category of the market.
In Diabetes Care, worldwide sales increased 33.2 percent on a reported basis in the fourth quarter, including a favorable 5.6 percent effect of foreign exchange, and increased 27.6 percent on an operational basis. Strong double-digit international sales growth was led by FreeStyle Libre, Abbott's revolutionary CGM system. FreeStyle Libre is the only CGM system available that comes factory-calibrated and removes the need for routine fingersticks 3 for people with diabetes. During the fourth quarter, Abbott initiated the U.S. launch of FreeStyle Libre, and in January 2018, Abbott announced that FreeStyle Libre is now available and approved for coverage by CMS.
ABBOTT ISSUES FINANCIAL OUTLOOK FOR 2018
Abbott is issuing full-year 2018 guidance for diluted earnings per share from continuing operations under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) of $1.22 to $1.32.
Abbott forecasts net specified items for the full year 2018 of approximately $1.58 per share. Specified items include intangible amortization expense, acquisition-related expenses, charges associated with cost reduction initiatives and other expenses.
Excluding specified items, projected adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations would be $2.80 to $2.90 for the full year 2018.
Abbott is issuing first-quarter 2018 guidance for diluted earnings per share from continuing operations under GAAP of $0.16 to $0.18. Abbott forecasts specified items for the first quarter of $0.41 per share primarily related to intangible amortization expense, acquisition-related expenses, cost reduction initiatives and other expenses. Excluding specified items, projected adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations would be $0.57 to $0.59.
Abbott has stated its commitment to reduce its debt levels following the recent acquisitions of St. Jude Medical and Alere, Inc. For the full year 2017, Abbott generated operating cash flow in excess of $5.0 billion and free cash flow 4 in excess of $4.0 billion. In January 2018, Abbott repaid $4.0 billion of debt and anticipates additional debt repayments throughout 2018.

The provisional estimate of the impact of U.S. tax reform is based on Abbott's initial analysis of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and may be adjusted in future periods due to, among other things, additional analysis performed by Abbott and additional guidance that may be issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury.
2)
2017 and 2016 Earnings and Diluted Earnings per Common Share from Discontinued Operations primarily reflect net favorable adjustments to tax expense as a result of the resolution of various tax positions from previous years related to discontinued operations.
3)
2017 Earnings from Continuing Operations, excluding Specified Items, excludes net after-tax charges of $2.167 billion, or $1.24 per share, for the estimated impact of U.S. tax reform, intangible amortization expense and expenses primarily associated with acquisitions, restructuring actions and other expenses.
2016 Earnings from Continuing Operations, excluding Specified Items, excludes net after-tax charges of $206 million, or $0.14 per share, for intangible amortization expense, expenses primarily associated with acquisitions, including bridge facility fees and other debt related costs, charges related to cost reduction initiatives and other expenses.
4)
2017 Average number of common shares outstanding excludes approximately 12.2 million shares related to dilutive common stock options, which would be antidilutive as a result of the loss in the quarter.
