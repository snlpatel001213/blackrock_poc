Jan 25 (Reuters) - U.S. weapons maker Northrop Grumman Corp reported a 3.7 percent rise in quarterly revenue, helped by higher sales in its aerospace and mission systems businesses.
Net sales rose to $6.63 billion in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31 from $6.40 billion a year earlier. ( bit.ly/2DBxzFn )
However, net income for the maker of Global Hawk surveillance planes fell to $178 million, or $1.01 per share, from $525 million, or $2.96 per share, a year earlier.
Net earnings were hurt by a higher tax expense and $500 million discretionary pre-tax pension contribution. (Reporting by Ankit Ajmera in Bengaluru;Editing by Anil Dâ€˜Silva)
