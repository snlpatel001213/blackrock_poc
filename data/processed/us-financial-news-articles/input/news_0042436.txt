Jan 23 (Reuters) - British pub operator Marston’s Plc said on Tuesday trading in Christmas period was marred by snowy and icy weather in the UK and would hurt its annual profit by 1 million pounds ($1.40 million).
The impact of weather on its like-for-like sales in the 16 weeks to Jan. 20 was around 2 percent, Marston’s said.
However, like-for-like sales excluding the impact of the snow-affected weeks were up 1.1 percent, said the company, which brews ales such as IPA, Old Speckled Hen and runs over 1,500 pubs across the UK. ($1 = 0.7160 pounds) (Reporting by Rahul B in Bengaluru; Editing by Gopakumar Warrier)
