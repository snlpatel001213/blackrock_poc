BEIJING (Reuters) - A worker at a factory in China operated by iPhone maker Foxconn died on Saturday after jumping from a window, according to a statement from China Labour Watch, a U.S.-based activist organization, which cited information from employees. 
Ming Li was a dispatch worker from an agency at the factory in Zhengzhou, the capital city of Henan province. He lived at the factory, one of the company’s largest in China. 
It is still not known why he jumped, China Labour Watch said in an email. 
Foxconn’s Chinese headquarters in Shenzhen could not be reached for comment outside of normal business hours. 
The report comes after a small number of students were discovered in November working overtime in Foxconn’s Chinese factory, violating local labor laws. 
Apple Inc and Foxconn, formally known as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co and a major supplier to the U.S. firm, have been accused of poor labor practices in the past. 
But the U.S. firm has been trying to get a grip of such issues, releasing annual reviews of the iPhone supply chain. Reporting by Josephine Mason and Meng Meng; additional reporting by Vincent Lee; Editing by Himani Sarkar
