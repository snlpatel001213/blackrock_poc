WASHINGTON—The FBI on Wednesday urged the White House not to release a memo detailing what Republicans allege were surveillance abuses during the 2016 election campaign, a move that President Donald Trump has said he is inclined to do. 
“With regard to the House Intelligence Committee’s memorandum, the FBI was provided a limited opportunity to review this memo the day before the committee voted to release it,” the bureau said in a statement. “As expressed during our initial review, we have grave concerns about material omissions of fact that fundamentally impact the memo’s accuracy.” 
Law enforcement officials had made a similar argument to the White House on Monday in a meeting with Federal Bureau of Investigation Director Christopher Wray and deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein about the memo, which was written by the Republican staff on the House Intelligence Committee. The memo is based on highly-classified material and alleges that an associate of Trump was surveilled improperly, according to people familiar with it. 
But on Tuesday, Trump suggested he had already decided to approve the release. His assertion seemed to undermine White House chief of staff John Kelly’s assurance that no decision would be reached until the National Security Council and White House lawyers had time to vet the material before it is made public.
