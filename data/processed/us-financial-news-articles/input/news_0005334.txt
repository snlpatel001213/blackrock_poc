Mobike Chuxing was set up in December with registered capital of 20 million yuan (2.21 million pounds). 
With the strategic investment, FAW will provide electric cars for the project. 
FAW, in a statement, said it had signed a deal to buy the stake but did not disclose financial details. 
The investment will not have a significant impact on FAW’s earnings. Mobike, whose backers include Tencent ( 0700.HK ) and Sequoia, has 100 million users and supports roughly 25 million rides a day. 
Its top competitor, ofo, raised $450 million in May last year from a range of investors, including Chinese ride-sharing service Didi Chuxing. Reporting by Josephine Mason and Meng Meng; Editing by Susan Fenton
