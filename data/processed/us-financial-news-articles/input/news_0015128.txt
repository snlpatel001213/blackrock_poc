"First quarter performance was in line with our expectations, thanks to strong momentum in Business & Administrations, with in particular, robust growth in Energy & Resources and a recovery in France. However, the Education business has slowed due to fewer working days as well as low client retention last year.
The pipeline for new contracts is good. Our revenue growth should progressively improve in the coming quarters. In addition, the recent acquisitions of Centerplate in the US and Morris Corporation in Australia will contribute as of next quarter. We maintain our objectives for Fiscal 2018."
Highlights of the period
Fiscal 2018 first quarter revenues totaled 5.3 billion euro, down -2.6% compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year. Currency effects represented -4.1%, and net acquisitions/disposals -0.3%. Organic growth reached +1.9%. Organic growth for On-site Services was +1.8%, reflecting: Solid growth in Business & Administrations at +5.2%. The performance remains strong in North America. Recovery is continuing in the Energy & Resources segment due to new contract start-ups.

Modest growth, as expected, in Health Care & Seniors at +1.0%. Weak performance in North America was offset by robust development in Brazil and Latin America. In Europe, bidding opportunities remained highly competitive, but the United Kingdom won some encouraging new business during the period. A -4.0% decline in Education . North American Universities suffered from poor prior year retention, and from weak comparable unit growth due to a negative calendar impact. Organic revenue growth in Benefits and Rewards Services was +3.8%. Growth in Europe, Asia and the United States remained strong at +8.6%, with solid growth in Europe as well as continued strong momentum in Incentive & Recognition.
