RAMALLAH, West Bank (Reuters) - Israeli troops shot dead a Palestinian youth during a confrontation in the occupied West Bank on Tuesday, a Palestinian official said. 
An Israeli spokeswoman said a large crowd of Palestinians set tyres ablaze and threw rocks at the troops, who responded with “dispersal means”. 
She could not confirm initially whether troops had used live rounds but said the military was aware of the Palestinian fatality and that the incident was being investigated. 
The Palestinian health ministry named the dead youth as Layth Abu Naeem and said he was 16-years-old. 
Faraj al-Nassan, the head of al-Mugheir village, said a confrontation had erupted after Israeli troops entered his village and that the youth was hit from close range. He was taken to hospital in nearby Ramallah. 
Tensions in the region have risen since U.S. President Donald Trump’s announcement on Dec. 6 recognising disputed Jerusalem as Israel’s capital, and at least 19 Palestinians and one Israeli have been killed since. Reporting by Ali Sawafta, Writing by Ori Lewis, Editing by Angus MacSwan
