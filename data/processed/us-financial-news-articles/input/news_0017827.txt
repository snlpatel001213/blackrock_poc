STEVENSON, Md.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- The securities litigation law firm of Brower Piven, A Professional Corporation, has commenced an investigation into possible breaches of fiduciary duty and other violations of state law by the Board of Directors of DST Systems, Inc. (NYSE: DST) (“DST Systems” or the “Company”) relating to the proposed buyout of DST Systems by SS&C Technologies Holdings, Inc.
Under the terms of the agreement, DST Systems shareholders are anticipated to receive $84.00 in cash for each share of DST Systems common stock held. The firm’s investigation seeks to determine, among other things, whether the Company’s Board of Directors failed to satisfy their duties to shareholders, including whether the Board adequately pursued alternatives to the acquisition and whether the Board obtained the best price possible for the Company’s shares of common stock.
