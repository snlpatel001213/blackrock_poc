MORRISVILLE, Vt., Jan. 17, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Union Bankshares, Inc. (NASDAQ:UNB) today announced results for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017. Consolidated net income for the three months ended December 31, 2017 was $1.9 million, or $0.43 per share, compared to $2.3 million, or $0.53 per share, for the same period in 2016, and $8.4 million, or $1.89 per share, for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $8.5 million, or $1.91 per share, for the same period in 2016.
The decrease in earnings for three and twelve month comparison periods is due to a one-time charge to earnings of $447 thousand for the revaluation of the Company's deferred tax assets as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act being signed into law on December 22, 2017.
Fourth Quarter Highlights
Highlights of the three months ended December 31, 2017 compared to the three months ended December 31, 2016 include:
Net income before taxes increased $399 thousand, or 14.3% to $3.2 million. Net interest income increased $709 thousand, or 11.2% to $7.1 million. Total assets increased $54.4 million, or 7.9%, to $745.7 million. Loans increased $53.6 million, or 9.9%, to $595.4 million. The loan servicing portfolio increased $47.4 million, or 10.7% to $489.1 million. Deposits increased $49.9 million, or 8.4%, to $647.6 million.
The improvement in net income before tax quarter over quarter is attributable to the increase in net interest income as noted above partially offset by a decrease in noninterest income of $230 thousand and increases in the provision for loan losses of $50 thousand and in noninterest expenses of $30 thousand. The increase in income tax expense of $822 thousand quarter over quarter is two-fold. As mentioned above a $447 thousand adjustment to income tax expense was recorded for revaluing deferred tax assets for the new tax law. Also, income tax expense for the three months ended December 31, 2016 was reduced by $288 thousand for a rehabilitation tax credit related to a low income housing investment project.
Year-to-Date Highlights
Highlights of the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to year ended December 31, 2016 include:
Net income before taxes increased $943 thousand, or 8.5%, to $12.1 million. Net interest income increased $2.0 million, or 8.0% to $26.8 million.

Nonperforming loans were 0.28% of total loans.
For the year ended December 31, 2017, noninterest income was $9.4 million, a decrease of $744 thousand from the same period a year ago.

These decreases were partially offset by increases in overdraft fee income of $56 thousand and loan servicing income of $92 thousand.
