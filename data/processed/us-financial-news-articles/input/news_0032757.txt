LONDON (Reuters) - Fibre broadband provider CityFibre ( CITYC.L ) said it had picked the English new town of Milton Keynes to launch its gigabit-capable home fibre network in partnership with Vodafone ( VOD.L ). 
CityFibre will invest at least 40 million pounds in building its network in Milton Keynes, the first roll-out in a plan to connect around 12 cities and 1 million premises with fast broadband marketed by Vodafone. 
The two companies announced their partnership in November, putting pressure on Britain’s biggest network provider, BT’s ( BT.L ) Openreach, which nearly all operators rely on to provide broadband connections in Britain.
