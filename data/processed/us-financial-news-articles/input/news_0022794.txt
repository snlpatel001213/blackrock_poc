The December 22, 2017 enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 resulted in an immediate recognition of a tax benefit of $2.8 million as CTBI is in a net deferred tax liability position. The impact to earnings per share was $0.16 per share for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2017. As a result of the positive impact on income tax expense during the period, CTBI announced a one-time bonus for all non-executive employees of $1,000 per full-time employee and $500 per part-time employee. The $0.7 million after-tax impact to earnings per share resulting from this accrual was $0.04 per share for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2017. The net impact to earnings per share from these two events, therefore, was an increase of $0.12 per share.
