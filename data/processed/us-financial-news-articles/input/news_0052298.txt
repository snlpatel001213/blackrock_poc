ALISO VIEJO, Calif., Jan. 29, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- ConcertoHealth , the leading provider of specialized primary care and supporting clinical services for vulnerable, frail and elderly patients, announced today it is relocating its corporate headquarters from Irvine, Calif., to Aliso Viejo, Calif. The transition is the first phase of the company's five-year growth strategy as ConcertoHealth continues to expand into new markets.
ConcertoHealth supports health plans and their primary care provider (PCP) networks in caring for their most vulnerable patients. The ConcertoHealth Primary Care Support Platform combines its proprietary population health analytics platform, Patient 3D , with on-the-ground care teams including social workers, care managers, pharmacists, field-based clinicians, and dietitians. This care model integrates clinical care with social services to offer high-touch, individualized primary and preventive care for these patients, regardless of the care setting, be it at home, a doctor's office, the hospital or post-acute setting.
"We are excited about relocating our headquarters to Aliso Viejo, and strengthening our staff to better serve our ever-growing patient base and health plan partners in both existing and new markets," said Alec Cunningham, President and CEO of ConcertoHealth. "This transition plays a critical role in our growth strategy, and the future of ConcertoHealth."
The new Aliso Viejo headquarters will house 110 ConcertoHealth employees to deploy primary care support services for both current and new health plan partners; perform corporate administrative functions; and pursue technological innovation, new market expansions and product development. This move specifically provides the information technology and healthcare services support departments with additional space for continued growth.
ConcertoHealth plans to accommodate nationwide growth by adding 120 full-time employees by April, bringing the total to 550 staff members.
ConcertoHealth also operates two clinical hubs (Kalamazoo, Mich., and Southfield, Mich.) and seven ConcertoHealth Care Centers across Michigan and Washington states. The Care Centers offer services that go beyond the scope of a traditional doctor's office to include 24/7 care coordination and support, and access to physicians, nurses, field-based clinicians, care coordinators, social workers, and pharmacists.
The new 28,700 sq. ft. ConcertoHealth corporate headquarters officially opened today, and is located at 85 Enterprise, Suite 200, Aliso Viejo, CA 92656.
