PARIS (Reuters) - Chanel brought a touch of early spring to Haute Couture week in Paris on Tuesday as models decked out in delicate, flower-strewn gowns paraded through rose-covered archways and around a fountain in a specially-built garden.
The collection by designer Karl Lagerfeld, 84, unveiled inside Paris’ glass-domed Grand Palais exhibition hall, included a white wedding pant suit with an enormous feathered train.
Designs in pale pink or white dominated the show, with pleats and gauzy skirts galore and intricate layered numbers.

Models - including 16-year-old Kaia Gerber, daughter of supermodel Cindy Crawford - showed off intricate wedge boots assorted to their outfits, some with lace, some with sequins and jewels.
Displays from Paris’ select Haute couture club - a small circle of designers creating luxury, handmade outfits for clients - runs until Jan. 25.
