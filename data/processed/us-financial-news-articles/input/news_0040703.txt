For the uninitiated, Barrett-Jackson’s auctions are a car lover’s (and celebrity spotter’s) dream. But these auctions are more than a place to see cool cars; this is, after all, an auction and millions of dollars worth of vehicles are sold each year at Barrett-Jackson’s annual event in Scottsdale, Arizona. 
The company’s 47th annual auction in Scottsdale, which was held over the weekend, was no different. In all, 1,721 vehicles sold for a total of $106.8 million. More than 1,100 pieces of automobilia brought in over $3.7 million, including a full-size transportation-themed carousel for $557,750 and circa 1939 Husky Gasoline porcelain service station sign for $149,500. 
More than $6 million was raised through the sale of charity vehicles, including a first production 2019 Corvette ZR1 that sold for $925,000. Ford also auctioned off the 2019 Ford Mustang Bullitt with VIN 001 for $300,000. The limited-edition vehicle was unveiled earlier this month at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit. All of the proceeds from the auction will go towards Boys Republic, a school and treatment community for youth at risk that helped McQueen as a child. 
Total auction sales were more than $116.7 million. 
The auction week also brought in a number of celebrity guests, including Jay Leno, Olympian Michael Phelps, country singer Kenny Chesney, actors David Spade and Tim Allen as well as NBA basketball player Alan Williams , former Arizona Cardinals head coach Bruce Arians, and Arizona Governor Doug Ducey. 
The company also produces auctions in Palm Beach, Florida, Mohegan Sun in Connecticut, and Las Vegas.
