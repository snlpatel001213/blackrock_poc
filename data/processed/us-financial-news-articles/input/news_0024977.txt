By Bruno Federowski BRASILIA, Jan 16 (Reuters) - Brazilian stocks on Tuesday edged up to an all-time high as optimism over the nation's economic prospects kept an early-year rally alive. The benchmark Bovespa stock index rose 0.3 percent to 79,951, nearing the 80,000 milestone for the first-time ever. Demand for Brazilian assets has been underpinned by expectations that stronger economic growth lifts corporate earnings in 2018. Brazil's gross domestic product is expected to grow almost 3 percent in 2018, turning the page on its deepest recession in decades. Still, analysts say the positive outlook hinges on policymakers' ability to plug a growing budget deficit and implement market-friendly reforms as the nation heads into wide-open presidential elections. "Insufficient progress towards fiscal consolidation could potentially jeopardize the recently achieved gains in macroeconomic performance and asset prices," Goldman Sachs economist Alberto Ramos wrote in a report. Shares in petrochemical Braskem SA led gains on the index after analysts at Ita√∫ BBA upgraded their recommendation on the stock to "outperform" from "market perform." Embraer SA rose slightly after the planemaker hit its output targets for 2017, although fourth-quarter deliveries fell sharply from the year before. Foreign exchange markets saw limited moves, with the Brazilian real nearly flat. The Mexican peso rose for a second day on hopes that U.S. President Donald Trump take a softer stance on trade negotiations. The Mexican currency rallied on Monday following a report that said Trump may be shying away from terminating the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Mexico sells around four-fifths of its exports to the United States so it is particularly vulnerable to increased U.S. protectionism.
