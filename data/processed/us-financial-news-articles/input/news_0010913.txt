(Reuters) - Many nations, including the United States, Canada and several European countries, as well as top United Nations and EU officials are among those demanding the release of Reuters reporters Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo from detention in Myanmar.
The reporters were arrested four weeks ago, on Dec. 12, after being invited to meet police officials on the outskirts of Yangon. They had worked on stories about a military crackdown in Rakhine state, from where about 665,000 Rohingya Muslims have fled since August and sought refuge in Bangladesh, according to the United Nations.
The two journalists were sent to Yangon’s Insein prison after a brief court appearance on Dec. 27, when they were allowed to meet their families and a lawyer for the first time since their arrest. Their second court appearance is due on Wednesday.
Myanmar’s Ministry of Information has said the reporters “illegally acquired information with the intention to share it with foreign media,” and released a photo of them in handcuffs at the time of the arrest.
It said the reporters and two policemen faced charges under the British colonial-era Official Secrets Act, which carries a maximum prison sentence of 14 years, though officials said they have not been charged.
Reuters President and Editor-In-Chief Stephen J. Adler has called for the immediate release of Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo.
“As they near their hearing date, it remains entirely clear that they are innocent of any wrongdoing,” Adler said in a statement on Monday.
“Their arrest and continued incarceration represent an egregious attack on press freedom — preventing them, and deterring other journalists, from reporting independently in Myanmar.”
Here are comments on their detention from governments, politicians, human rights groups, journalists and press freedom advocates around the world:
LATEST REACTION - Former U.S. President Bill Clinton called on Monday for the immediate release of the two journalists. “A free press is critical to a free society - the detention of journalists anywhere is unacceptable,” Clinton said in a Twitter post.
- The Committee to Protect Journalists called on Myanmar on Monday to cease all legal proceedings against the two Reuters journalists and release them from jail.
“The proceedings against Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo are a transparent attempt to intimidate the media and to prevent coverage of the unfolding tragedy of the Rohingya people in Myanmar’s Rakhine state,” said Steven Butler, CPJ’s Asia program coordinator.
“The two reporters should not be in jail for trying to uncover the truth about this story of vital public interest.”
- Samantha Power, former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, called the arrests “an outrage and a symptom of a world without credible U.S. leadership” in a Twitter post.
GOVERNMENTS, MULTILATERAL ORGANIZATIONS - U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has said the United States was “demanding their immediate release or information as to the circumstances around their disappearance.”
- Senator Ben Cardin, the leading Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee called the arrests of the two journalists “outrageous”.
“It just brings back the memory of the horrible practices with the repressive military rule,” he said.
- Republican Thom Tillis and Democrat Chris Coons, leaders of the U.S. Senate Human Rights Caucus, said they were “gravely concerned” about the reporters’ arrests and that press freedom was critical to ensuring accountability for violence against the Rohingya.

- Yanghee Lee and David Kaye, the U.N. special rapporteurs on Myanmar and on freedom of expression respectively, said, “Journalism is not a crime.
