Jan 17 (Reuters) - Kinder Morgan Canada Ltd said on Wednesday that the start-up of its Trans Mountain pipeline expansion would now be delayed by three months from its previous target of September 2020.
The project had an operational date of December 2019, but the company in October pushed that back to September 2020 because of the difficulty in obtaining permits.
Kinder Morgan Canada said on Wednesday it is still pursuing a “primarily permiting” strategy on its Trans Mountain pipeline expansion.
The company also said that its net income more than doubled to C$46.4 million ($37.3 million) in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, from a year earlier.
Last month, Canada’s energy regulator ruled in favor of the company’s appeal to sidestep some municipal permits for the pipeline, marking a major victory for the C$7.4 billion project.
Kinder Morgan Canada was spun off from Kinder Morgan in May last year.
Shares of the former parent company were up nearly 3 percent in extended trading after it reported better-than-expected fourth quarter results. ($1 = C$1.24) (Reporting by John Benny in Bengaluru; Editing by Savio D‘Souza and Maju Samuel)
