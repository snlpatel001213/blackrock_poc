President Donald Trump delivered his first State of the Union address to Congress on Tuesday night.
He highlighted positive economic developments and touted initiatives such as the Republican tax-cut bill the president signed into law in December.
Trump also laid out his vision for reforming the nation's infrastructure and ensured what he considers "fair" trade with other nations.
Earlier Tuesday, reports surfaced suggesting that Trump would use especially sharp language regarding rogue state North Korea and its nuclear-weapons program.
