Canadian pharmaceutical billionaires Barry and Honey Sherman were murdered in a targeted killing, Toronto police said on Friday, but no one has been charged in their deaths. 
Police disclosed that they were treating the case as murders six weeks after the Shermans were found dead. They were hanging by belts from a railing next to a swimming pool in their home, a friend close to the family told Reuters. 
Autopsies conducted in December determined that Barry, 75, and Honey, 70, died from ligature neck compression, police previously said in a statement.
