NEW YORK (Reuters) - At least 12 people were hurt on Tuesday as a fire tore through an apartment building in the Bronx, just days after another blaze in the New York City borough killed 12 people, a New York City Fire Department spokesman said. 
The six-alarm fire broke out at about 5:30 a.m. local time in a four-story brick structure with a furniture store on the ground floor, Kenneth Reilly told Reuters. 
One of the injuries was serious and potentially life-threatening, while the others were minor, he said. 
More than 200 firefighters were still battling the blaze in frigid temperatures of around 15 degrees Fahrenheit two hours after it started, said Reilly, adding that the cause was yet to be determined. 
Last Thursday, 12 people, including four children, were killed in the New York Cityâ€™s deadliest blaze in a quarter of a century in another part of the Bronx less than two miles away. That fire was caused by a three-year-old boy playing with the burners of a kitchen stove in one of the apartments, officials said.
