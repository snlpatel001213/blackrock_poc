Americans are polarized on many issues, but they tend to be on the same page when it comes to assessing the health risks from marijuana, compared with alcoholic beverages, tobacco or sugar. 
Far more people say a cigarette, an alcoholic drink or a candy bar are more harmful to a personâ€™s overall health than pot, a new Wall Street Journal/NBC News survey finds. 
Only 9% of people ranked marijuana as the most harmful of the four, far fewer than the 41% who named tobacco, the 24% who cited alcohol and the 21% who picked sugar. MarketWatch Partner Center
