MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian police searched the campaign headquarters of opposition leader Alexei Navalny in St Petersburg on Thursday ahead of a presidential election on March 18, a video feed streamed live to the Internet by Navalny’s supporters showed. 
The feed showed police checking campaigners’ passports. Russia’s central election commission declined to register Navalny as a candidate in the election, citing what Navalny said was a trumped up criminal conviction. 
Thursday’s police search took place on the same day as President Vladimir Putin, who polls show is on track to be comfortably re-elected, was visiting St Petersburg. Reporting by Christian Lowe; Writing by Andrew Osborn; Editing by Christian Lowe
