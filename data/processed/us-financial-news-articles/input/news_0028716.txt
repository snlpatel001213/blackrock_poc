Based in San Francisco, Gachot will lead NewVoiceMedia’s sales organization in North America, accelerating growth through new customer acquisition and maintaining successful and trusted partnerships with existing customers. He brings more than 20 years of experience in enterprise software sales leadership, most recently serving as Chief Revenue Officer at Everwise, where he was responsible for driving the growth of the company’s portfolio of integrated solutions across applications, platform and infrastructure. Prior to that, he held senior management roles at several leading high-tech firms, including Capriza, Spredfast and IBM. He is a proven leader in building and transforming SaaS companies — from early years to successful IPO and acquisitions —on a global basis.
Gachot’s appointment is the latest milestone in NewVoiceMedia’s continued rapid global expansion, closely following its reported international bookings growth of 55 percent in FY 2017 and position in the Forbes Cloud 100, the publication’s annual list of the top 100 private cloud companies in the world. The firm now serves more than 700 customers spanning six continents, helping to dramatically improve their sales and deliver a better, more emotive customer experience.
In his new role, Gachot will report to CEO Dennis Fois, who commented, “I’m very pleased to welcome Olivier to NewVoiceMedia as we embark on our next phase of growth, aimed at doubling turnover by 2020. We operate in a multi-billion-dollar market that is rapidly transitioning to the cloud, and Olivier is an extremely valuable customer advocate as we further accelerate our growth trajectory with particular emphasis on the North American market, while continuing to develop world-class customer success for our growing customer base.”
Gachot said, “As the only truly global platform that addresses requirements for both sales and service teams, NewVoiceMedia has a tremendous opportunity to take a leading position in a multi-billion-dollar market. I’m very excited to join the business and support its already impressive growth, while helping our customers dramatically improve their sales and deliver a better, more emotive customer experience.”
