MILAN (Reuters) - Italy needs to start thinking of a partnership in the space industry with France after the two countries have joined forces over the naval sector, Industry Minister Carlo Calenda said on Friday. 
“We now must think of a partnership in the space sector. We must do so with attention, as it is (an industry with) sensitive companies, but we must face the challenge,” Calenda said at a conference in Rome organised by Italian companies’ association Confindustria and its French peer Medef. 
In September Italian shipbuilder Fincantieri ( FCT.MI ) took effective control of French rival STX France under a shared ownership agreement. 
The move set the conditions to explore the creation of a Franco-Italian naval defence group, merging France’s Naval group with Fincantieri. Reporting by Alberto Sisto
