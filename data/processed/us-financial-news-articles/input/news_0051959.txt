WARSAW, Ind., Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc. (NYSE and SIX: ZBH) today reported financial results for the quarter and full year ended December 31, 2017. The Company reported fourth quarter net sales of $2.074 billion, an increase of 3.0% over the prior year period, and an increase of 1.5% on a constant currency basis. Diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter were $6.16, and include a one-time tax benefit of approximately $6.40 resulting from the recently enacted U.S. tax reform legislation. Fourth quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share were $2.10, a decrease of 1.9% from the prior year period.
Full-year 2017 net sales were $7.824 billion, an increase of 1.8% over the prior year, on both a reported and constant currency basis. Full-year revenues increased by 0.5% over the prior year on a constant currency basis, excluding approximately 130 basis points of contribution from the LDR Holding Corporation acquisition. Diluted earnings per share for the full year were $9.03. Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the full year were $8.03, an increase of 0.9% over the prior year.
Bryan Hanson, President and CEO of Zimmer Biomet, said: "Since joining the Company last month, I have been performing a thorough review of the business. My immediate priorities are to improve Zimmer Biomet's execution and address a number of near-term challenges that have impacted, and will continue to impact, our performance. With that said, I fully believe in the power of the Zimmer Biomet global brand and portfolio of products, and I am confident that with sound strategy and enhanced execution we can drive sustained shareholder value."
Net earnings for the fourth quarter were $1.257 billion, and $428.5 million on an adjusted basis. Operating cash flow for the fourth quarter was $402.9 million.
Net earnings for full-year 2017 were $1.840 billion, and $1.636 billion on an adjusted basis.
In the quarter, the Company paid $48.6 million in dividends and declared a fourth quarter dividend of $0.24 per share. The Company also repaid $300.0 million of debt during the quarter. For full-year 2017, the Company paid $193.6 million in dividends and repaid approximately $1.250 billion of debt.
(1) U.S. tax reform legislation resulted in a net favorable provisional adjustment due to the reduction of certain deferred tax liabilities which were partially offset by provisional tax charges related to the toll tax provision of U.S. tax reform. The amount recognized is a provisional estimate and subject to change, possibly materially, due to, among other things, refinements of the Company's calculations, changes in interpretations and assumptions the Company has made or additional guidance issued by the U.S. Treasury, Securities and Exchange Commission or Financial Accounting Standards Board.
Guidance
For the first quarter of 2018, the Company expects revenue in the range of $1.955 billion to $1.995 billion, representing a change of negative 1.0% to positive 1.0% compared to the prior year period, and negative 4.0% to negative 2.0% on a constant currency basis compared to the prior year period, inclusive of negative impact related to approximately one less billing day compared to the prior year period.
Additionally, the Company expects its diluted earnings per share for the first quarter of 2018 to be in a range of $0.73 to $0.88, and in a range of $1.84 to $1.91 on an adjusted basis.

Website Information
We routinely post important information for investors on our website, www.zimmerbiomet.com , in the "Investor Relations" section. We use this website as a means of disclosing material, non-public information and for complying with our disclosure obligations under Regulation FD. Accordingly, investors should monitor the Investor Relations section of our website, in addition to following our press releases, SEC filings, public conference calls, presentations and webcasts. The information contained on, or that may be accessed through, our website is not incorporated by reference into, and is not a part of, this document.
Note on Non-GAAP Financial Measures
This press release includes non-GAAP financial measures that differ from financial measures calculated in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). These non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similar measures reported by other companies and should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, other measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.
Sales change information for the three-month period and the year ended December 31, 2017 is presented on a GAAP (reported) basis and on a constant currency basis. The sales change information for the full year is also presented on a constant currency basis that excludes the contribution from the Company's acquisition of LDR Holding Corporation in July 2016. Projected revenue change information is also presented on a GAAP basis and on a constant currency basis. Constant currency rates exclude the effects of foreign currency exchange rates. They are calculated by translating current and prior-period sales at the same predetermined exchange rate. The translated results are then used to determine year-over-year percentage increases or decreases.
Net earnings, diluted earnings per share and projected diluted earnings per share are presented on a GAAP (reported) basis and on an adjusted basis. Adjusted earnings and adjusted diluted earnings per share exclude the effects of inventory step-up; certain inventory and manufacturing-related charges connected to discontinuing certain product lines, quality enhancement and remediation efforts; special items; intangible asset amortization; certain claims; goodwill impairment; debt extinguishment charges; any related effects on our income tax provision associated with these items; the effect of U.S. tax reform; and other certain tax adjustments. Special items include expenses resulting directly from our business combinations and/or global restructuring, quality and operational excellence initiatives, including employee termination benefits, certain contract terminations, consulting and professional fees, dedicated project personnel, asset impairment or loss on disposal charges, certain litigation matters, costs of complying with our deferred prosecution agreement and other items. Other certain tax adjustments include a tax restructuring that lowered the tax rate on deferred tax liabilities recorded on intangible assets recognized in acquisition-related accounting, net favorable resolutions of various tax matters, a favorable tax rate change in a foreign jurisdiction and charges from internal restructuring transactions that provide the Company access to cash in a tax efficient manner.
Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures internally to evaluate the performance of the business and believes they are useful measures that provide meaningful supplemental information to investors to consider when evaluating the performance of the Company. Management believes these measures offer the ability to make period-to-period comparisons that are not impacted by certain items that can cause dramatic changes in reported operating results, to perform trend analysis, to better identify operating trends that may otherwise be masked or distorted by these types of items and to provide additional transparency of certain items. In addition, certain of these non-GAAP financial measures are used as performance metrics in the Company's incentive compensation programs.
Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in this press release.

The Company recognized a $272.0 million non-cash goodwill impairment charge in the fourth quarter of 2018 related to its Spine less Asia Pacific reporting unit during its annual goodwill impairment testing. The impairment was driven by integration issues between the legacy Zimmer, Biomet and LDR businesses. In the third quarter of 2018, the Company recognized a $32.7 million non-cash goodwill impairment charge related to its Office Based Technologies reporting unit. Operating performance of this reporting unit has been lower than expected due to integration issues, management turnover and poor execution of its operating plans.
(3)
The tax effect for the U.S. jurisdiction is calculated based on an effective rate considering federal and state taxes, as well as permanent items where the items were or are projected to be incurred. For jurisdictions outside the U.S., the tax effect is estimated based upon the statutory rates where the items were or are projected to be incurred.
(4)
U.S. tax reform resulted in a net favorable provisional adjustment due to the reduction of certain deferred tax liabilities, which were partially offset by provisional tax charges related to the toll tax provision of U.S. tax reform.
(5)
In 2017, other certain tax adjustments relate to a favorable tax rate change in a foreign jurisdiction and net favorable adjustments from internal restructuring transactions. The 2016 adjustment primarily includes a favorable resolution of certain tax matters with taxing authorities offset by internal restructuring transactions that provide the Company access to offshore funds in a tax efficient manner.
(6)
The 2016 period includes negative effects from finalizing the tax accounts for the Biomet merger. Under the applicable U.S. GAAP rules, these measurement period adjustments are recognized on a prospective basis in the period of change.
(7)
In 2017, other certain tax adjustments relate to a tax restructuring that lowered the tax rate on deferred tax liabilities recorded on intangible assets recognized in acquisition-related accounting, net favorable resolutions of various tax matters, a favorable tax rate change in a foreign jurisdiction and net favorable adjustments from internal restructuring transactions. The 2016 adjustment primarily relates to a favorable adjustment to certain deferred tax liabilities recognized as part of acquisition-related accounting and favorable resolution of certain tax matters with taxing authorities offset by internal restructuring transactions that provide the Company access to offshore funds in a tax efficient manner.
