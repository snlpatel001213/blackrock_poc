A federal judge in San Francisco blocked the Trump administration’s effort to end an Obama-era program that protected hundreds of thousands of young immigrants from deportation. 
U.S. District Judge William Alsup temporarily blocked the ending of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program late Tuesday in a 49-page ruling. 
Alsup considered five separate lawsuits challenging President Donald Trump’s decision to end the program, which has protected as many as 800,000 young immigrants, known as Dreamers. 
In the ruling Alsup said the until the cases are completed, the administration must consider renewal applications from immigrants who were enrolled in the program when Trump announced its ending Sept. 5. 
The White House didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.
