CAMDEN, Maine, Jan. 30, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Camden National Corporation (NASDAQ: CAC; "Camden National" or the "Company"), a $4.1 billion bank holding company headquartered in Camden, Maine, reported net income for 2017 of $28.5 million and diluted earnings per share ("EPS") of $1.82 per share, compared to $40.1 million and $2.57 per share, respectively, a year ago. In the fourth quarter of 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the "Tax Act") was passed, and the Company recognized $14.3 million of additional income tax expense upon the revaluation of its deferred tax assets and liabilities. The Company's 2017 adjusted operating income 1 , which excludes the effect of the Tax Act, was $42.7 million, representing an increase of 7% over last year.
"The Company produced another year of strong financial results in 2017 led by loan growth of 7%, deposit growth of 6%, and improved asset quality over last year," said Gregory A. Dufour, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company. "Like many other financial institutions and companies, we revalued our deferred tax balances using the lower federal corporate tax rate in the fourth quarter of 2017 that resulted in a one-time income tax charge. While the lower federal corporate tax rate drove a reported net loss for the fourth quarter and lowered our reported earnings for 2017, we expect that it will prove beneficial over the long-run through higher earnings and continued investment in our company to create long-term shareholder value."
The Company reported a net loss of $3.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2017. Adjusted operating income 1 , excluding the effect of the Tax Act, was $11.1 million, compared to $11.3 million for the third quarter of 2017.
"The anticipated future tax savings provided us an opportunity to recognize the dedication and contribution of our employees as we provided a special bonus to all non-executive employees. Additionally, we announced an increase in funds for future compensation practices and education to help ensure we attract and retain the best talent possible," shared Dufour. "Complementing our employee investments, we announced that we will also increase our philanthropic efforts in 2018, reflecting our continued commitment to our communities."
Mr. Dufour added, "In December, the Company announced a 9% increase in the fourth quarter 2017 dividend to $0.25 per share. At December 31, 2017, the Company exceeded all regulatory capital standards and reported a tangible common equity ratio 1 of 7.66%."

FINANCIAL OPERATING RESULTS (linked quarter)
The Company reported a net loss of $3.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 driven by additional income tax expense of $14.3 million as it revalued its deferred tax assets and liabilities for the lower federal corporate tax rate that was enacted in late December. Adjusted operating income 1 for the fourth quarter decreased $249,000 to $11.1 million, compared to last quarter. The decrease in adjusted operating income 1 between quarters was driven by:
An increase in non-interest expense of $1.3 million due to: A discretionary cash bonus and related taxes totaling $709,000 awarded to all non-executive employees of the Company. An increase in furniture, equipment and data processing costs of $261,000 due to new technology investments in the fourth quarter of 2017, including a commercial loan platform and a deposit account platform. A decrease in non-interest income of $459,000 as the Company recognized $827,000 of gains on sale of investment securities last quarter, compared to $28,000 in the fourth quarter, partially offset by an increase in fees generated from the back-to-back commercial loan swap program of $637,000. An increase in net interest income of $499,000 due to: An increase in our loan yield of 3 basis points to 4.26% as a portion of our loan portfolio repriced due to increases in short-term interest rates; and A change in our funding mix in the fourth quarter with strong core deposit growth driving a 2 basis point decrease in our cost of funds to 0.60%. A decrease in the provision for credit losses of $579,000 driven by a decrease in net charge-offs of $301,000.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
Certain statements contained in this press release that are not statements of historical fact constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including certain plans, expectations, goals, projections and other statements, which are subject to numerous risks, assumptions and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements can be identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. They often include words like "believe," "expect," "anticipate," "estimate," and "intend" or future or conditional verbs such as "will," "would," "should," "could" or "may." Certain factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from expected results include changes in general economic conditions, changes in the interest rate environment, increased competitive pressures, operational risks including, but not limited to, cybersecurity, fraud and natural disasters, legislative and regulatory changes that adversely affect the business in which the Company is engaged, changes in the securities markets, and other risks and uncertainties disclosed from time to time in in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, as updated by other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"). The Company does not have any obligation to update forward-looking statements.
USE OF NON-GAAP MEASURES
In addition to evaluating the Company's results of operations in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ("GAAP"), management supplements this evaluation with certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as the efficiency ratio; tangible common equity ratio; adjusted operating income; adjusted operating diluted EPS; adjusted operating return on average assets; adjusted operating return on average equity; adjusted operating return on average tangible equity; and tangible book value per share. Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures help investors in understanding the Company's operating performance and trends and allow for better performance comparisons to other banks. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures remove the impact of unusual items that may obscure trends in the Company's underlying performance. These disclosures should not be viewed as a substitute for GAAP operating results, nor are they necessarily comparable to non-GAAP performance measures that may be presented by other financial institutions. Reconciliation to the comparable GAAP financial measure can be found in this document.
ANNUALIZED DATA
Certain returns, yields, and performance ratios are presented on an "annualized" basis. This is done for analytical and decision-making purposes to better discern underlying performance trends when compared to full year or year-over-year amounts.
