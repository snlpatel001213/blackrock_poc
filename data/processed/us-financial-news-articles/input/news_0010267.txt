The pan-European STOXX 600 index gained 0.3 percent to 399 points, its highest since August 2015 and edging closer to an all-time high of 414.06 points. Euro zone stocks .STOXXE rose 0.2 percent. 
Consumer staples and financials were the biggest boosts to the pan-European index after UK supermarket Morrisons reported strong results. 
Morrisons ( MRW.L ) rose 3.7 percent after reporting stronger than expected sales over the crucial Christmas period. 
Peers Sainsbury’s ( SBRY.L ) and Marks & Spencer ( MKS.L ) gained 3.2 and 2 percent respectively and the European retail sector index .SXRP was up 0.3 percent. 
Britain's FTSE 100 .FTSE was up 0.3 percent, outperforming European peers and recovering from Monday's fall. 
Telecoms and cable group Altice ( ATCA.AS ) stole the spotlight, jumping 6.5 percent as investors welcomed a decision to spin off its U.S. unit and simplifying the group’s structure in the process. 
Analysts at brokerage Raymond James said the move could also make the Altice European arm a possible acquisition target for rival French telecoms companies.
