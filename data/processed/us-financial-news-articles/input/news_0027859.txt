SUNNYVALE, Calif. & YOKNEAM, Israel--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Mellanox ® Technologies, Ltd. (NASDAQ: MLNX) today announced financial results for its fourth quarter and full year 2017 ended December 31, 2017.
“We are pleased to achieve record quarterly and full year revenues,” said Eyal Waldman, President and CEO of Mellanox Technologies. “2017 represented a year of investment and product transitions for Mellanox. Fourth quarter Ethernet revenues increased 11 percent sequentially, due to expanding customer adoption of our 25 gigabit per second and above Ethernet products across all geographies. We are encouraged by the acceleration of our 25 gigabit per second and above Ethernet switch business, which grew 41 percent sequentially, with broad based growth across OEM, hyperscale, tier-2, cloud, financial services and channel customers. During the fourth quarter, InfiniBand revenues grew 2 percent sequentially, driven by growth from our high-performance computing and artificial intelligence customers. For the full fiscal 2017, our revenues from the high performance computing market grew 13 percent year over year. Our 2017 results demonstrate the successful execution of our multi-year revenue diversification strategy, and our leadership position in 25 gigabit per second and above Ethernet adapters.”
