BEIJING, Jan 19 (Reuters) - Alpahbet Incâ€™s Google said it had agreed to a patent cross-licensing deal with Chinese social media and gaming firm Tencent Holdings Ltd, the U.S. company said on Friday.
The agreement covers a broad range of products and paves the way for collaboration on technology in the future, it said.
Google has similar patent agreements with a handful of other firms, but the latest agreement represents the first such deal with a large Chinese tech firm. (Reporting by Cate Cadell; Editing by Himani Sarkar)
