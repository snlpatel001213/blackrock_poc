LONDON (Reuters) - A British judge said she will not make a decision on Friday over whether to drop an arrest warrant against Julian Assange that stems from his breach of bail conditions, as the WikiLeaks founder steps up efforts to leave the Ecuadorean embassy.
Assange, 46, has been holed up in the central London building since 2012 after skipping bail to avoid extradition to Sweden over an allegation of rape, which he denies.
A verdict will not be handed down on Friday, Chief Magistrate Emma Arbuthnot said at Westminster Magistratesâ€™ Court.
