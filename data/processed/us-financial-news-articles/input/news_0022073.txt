Budget cuts have hindered taxpayer service and tech upgrades, according to in-house advocate Shutterstock The IRS budget declined 12.7% in constant dollars from its 2010 peak to fiscal 2016, according to agency data, and IRS staffing was down 17.7% in that period. The Trump administration last year proposed an annual budget for the agency of about $11 billion.

WASHINGTON—The Internal Revenue Service, after years of budget cuts, will struggle to implement the new tax law without more money, according to the agency’s in-house public advocate. 
It is far from clear, however, whether Congress will provide the IRS with additional funds. 
The tax agency needs to update forms, create new definitions, write regulations and field questions from taxpayers, which tend to increase when Congress passes new laws. That will be challenging for the IRS, which is planning to answer just 60% of taxpayer calls during the tax-filing season and has cut its training budget by 75% since 2009, said Nina Olson, the national taxpayer advocate. ‘We have already seen confusion about withholding changes, confusion about the deductibility of prepaid property taxes, and confusion about whether states can allow taxpayers to make charitable contributions in lieu of taxes as a way of permitting their residents to claim larger tax deductions.’ Nina Olson 
The taxpayer advocate leads an independent organization within the IRS that works on behalf of taxpayers, and issues an annual report to Congress on challenges facing taxpayers and the IRS. 
But since Republicans took over the House of Representatives in January 2011, they have clamped down on the agency’s funding, a trend that accelerated after a 2013 inspector general’s report found the IRS had used inappropriate criteria in giving scrutiny to some conservative groups seeking tax-exempt status.
