0 COMMENTS The sky isn’t falling in on Fox’s big European deal.
The U.K. antitrust body’s provisional move to block 21st Century Fox’s $15.5 billion bid for control of Sky on grounds of media plurality is an adroit one. It capitalizes politically on British antipathy for Rupert Murdoch, the octogenarian media mogul who controls 21st Century Fox as well as various U.K. newspapers (and The Wall Street Journal) through separately listed News Corp . Yet it also indicates a way forward that won’t cost 21st Century Fox or European pay-TV giant Sky anything.

The antitrust ruling builds on this by putting media plurality, rather than “broadcasting standards”—the other yardstick by which the U.K. government had asked the regulator to judge the deal—at the center of the action.
Damning their U.K. broadcasting standards would have been a continuing problem for both Fox and Sky. However, media plurality concerns fall away if Disney , which has no position in U.K. news, proves to be the one buying Sky.
The timing is problematic as Disney-Fox is likely to complete after Fox-Sky. But the detail of the U.K. ruling identifies solutions. For example, there could be an “event-based sunset clause,” whereby restrictions on the Sky takeover would fall away if the Disney-Fox deal completes on the terms proposed, or the sale of assets to Disney could be made a condition of the Sky takeover.
Sky shares rose in morning trading. The market has seen behind the headlines to what this really is: a way for everyone to save face.
