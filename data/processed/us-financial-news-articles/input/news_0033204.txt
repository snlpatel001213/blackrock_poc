President Trump’s big idea to reduce illegal immigration is a wall on the southern border. A wall would help restore integrity to the border, but it won’t solve a larger problem: widespread abuse of U.S. visas. The Department of Homeland Security estimated last year that 739,000 foreigners who arrived in the U.S. via air or sea in fiscal 2016 did not leave when they were supposed to. Some exited late, but as of Jan. 10, 2017, about 545,000 were suspected to be still in the country.
