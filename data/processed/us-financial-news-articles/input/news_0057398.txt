Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said Wednesday that the changes the company made to its service last year reduced time spent on the site by 50 million hours per day. 
"Already last quarter, we made changes to show fewer viral videos to make sure people's time is well spent. In total, we made changes that reduced time spent on Facebook by roughly 50 million hours every day. By focusing on meaningful connections, our community and business will be stronger over the long term," Zuckerberg wrote. 
The company has also begun to make changes to its content-recommendation software amid criticism that Facebook has been used to spread misinformation, hate speech and other violent content. 
On the company's previous earnings call in November, Zuckerberg had said: "I want to be clear about what our priority is. Protecting our community is more important than maximizing our profits." 
Zuckerberg made the comments as part of the company's fourth-quarter earnings announcement. John Shinal Technology Reporter for CNBC.com Related Securities
