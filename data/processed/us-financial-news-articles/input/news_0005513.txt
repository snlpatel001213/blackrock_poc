MILAN (Reuters) - Inter Milan coach Luciano Spalletti does not want to hear any talk of new signings, saying his club cannot afford to spend lavishly in this month’s transfer window and that they must get out of their rut themselves.

Inter went through their first 16 league games of the season unbeaten and led Serie A in early December but now find themselves in third place and seven points adrift of leaders Napoli after a poor run. 
Inter’s spending is being closely monitored by UEFA after the club fell foul of the European soccer body’s break-even rule known as financial fair play, ruling out a splurge in the January transfer window. 
“To keep saying that we must spend a lot in this transfer window, after the club has already set limits, seems to be the best way to harm ourselves,” Spalletti told reporters ahead of Friday’s Serie A match at Fiorentina. 
“It also reduces the chances of improving with what we have got,” he added. 
“No single player can arrive and change the fortune of a team, to say otherwise would be to send the wrong message to our players.” 
Spalletti described the transfer window as a distraction. 
”Everyone knows we cannot make big signings in this window,“ he said. ”We can do better by making sure that our players play to their potential. That’s how you get over difficult moments. 
“The lads who are training need to know that I believe in them completely, but they themselves have to be committed and know what it means to wear the Inter shirt.” Writing by Brian Homewood in Bern, editing by Ed Osmond
