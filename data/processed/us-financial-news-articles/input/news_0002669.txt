Whether you're snowed in at home or laying out on a beach, not every day out of the office requires a full day off. In fact, a survey conducted by the career site FlexJobs found remote work to be a desired perk among many professionals â€” 81 percent said it's the type of work flexibility they want most.
However, 95 percent of remote positions still have location requirements that limit where employees can work.
To help job seekers find a position that offers the full flexibility of being able to work from anywhere, FlexJobs has compiled a list of the top companies that offered the most work-from-anywhere jobs in 2017.
