TORONTO, Jan 9 (Reuters) - Canada’s main stock index ended flat on Tuesday, as shares of energy and marijuana producers rose and a real estate trust surged on a buyout offer, balancing a dip in the materials group which was pressured by a drop in gold prices.

* The Toronto Stock Exchange’s S&P/TSX composite index closed up 1.59 points, or 0.01 percent, at 16,319.24.
