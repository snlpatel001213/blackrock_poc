(Reuters) - The UKâ€™s Takeover Panel has extended the deadline for a consortium of companies to make an offer for British office firm IWG Plc ( IWG.L ) until 1700 GMT on Feb. 2. 
IWG received an approach in December from a consortium comprising Canadian private equity firm Onex Corp ( ONEX.TO ) and Brookfield Asset Management ( BAMa.TO ). 
Initially the consortium had until Jan. 20 to make an offer or walk away for at least six months, under Takeover Panel rules. Reporting by Bhanu Pratap in Bengaluru; Editing by Elaine Hardcastle
