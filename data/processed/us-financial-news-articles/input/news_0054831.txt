During Mr. Shay’s tenure, InterDigital’s licensing program has become one of the premier programs in the wireless industry.
Scott A McQuilkin, Senior Executive Vice President, Innovation – Scott McQuilkin joined InterDigital as Chief Financial Officer in 2007, and in 2012 transitioned to a more senior role in leadership of external investments, technology incubation, and innovation.
