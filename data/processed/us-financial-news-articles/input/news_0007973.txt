HOUSTON, Jan. 9, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Arcanum (the Company) today announced plans for expansion of its Butene-1 production complex. The Company's flagship project, Raven, an on-purpose Ethylene-to-Butene-1 processing facility, is currently under construction in Baytown, Texas. Permitting and other development efforts are now underway which would enable two additional on-purpose Butene-1 production facilities at the same location.
The Raven facility has secured long-term fee-based offtake agreements with commitments from multiple Butene-1 buyers for substantially all of its nameplate capacity. Raven may be able to accommodate increased demand for Butene-1 by operating beyond its originally planned capacity through operational optimizations. Additionally, Arcanum believes it is well-positioned to develop and invest in new production facilities to support significant growing North American demand for Butene-1. The existing project site has been developed with the capacity for future Butene-1 projects and related assets. Arcanum intends to leverage existing site infrastructure, prior engineering and construction experience, and industry and customer relationships to efficiently commercialize the additional Butene-1 facilities.
Chief Executive Officer: Ted M. Pettijohn
Ted M. Pettijohn has been named Chief Executive Officer of Arcanum and its subsidiary, SBE Chemical Partners I LLC. Pettijohn, a former Senior Vice President with Evonik Corporation, has over 25 years of experience in the specialty, polymer, and petrochemical industries.

We are on track for an on-time and on-budget start of the Raven unit in late 2018 and we are already working toward additional facilities. With the potential expanded capacity, Arcanum could become the largest Butene-1 supplier in the world."

Raven Holding Company, LLC operates under the trade name Arcanum. Through its subsidiary, SBE Chemical Partners I LLC, the Company is constructing and will operate the Raven Butene-1 production facility. Raven was developed by Evonik and Quanta Capital Solutions, Inc., an affiliate of First Infrastructure Capital.
Butene-1 is a linear alpha olefin (LAO) used in the manufacture of a variety of base chemical products, including as a co-monomer for production of polyethylene (LLDPE and HDPE). Most LAO products are produced by processes that result in a range of products, including Butene-1. However, the Raven facility is designed for dedicated on-purpose Butene-1 production from the processing of ethylene (an available derivative of natural gas) to meet anticipated growth in the polyethylene and associated markets.
