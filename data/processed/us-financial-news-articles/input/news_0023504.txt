Mr. Crapps commented, "A highlight of the fourth quarter was strong organic loan growth of $18.2 million, a 12.8% annualized growth rate. This loan growth is especially impressive given our commitment to credit quality and the strong performance of our loan portfolio. Pure deposit growth was strong during the year and with the additional liquidity provided by the acquisition of Cornerstone Bancorp we have the funding available to support significant additional loan growth. The strength of our deposit franchise continues to shine as our cost of deposits decreased to 0.22% even in this rising rate environment."
