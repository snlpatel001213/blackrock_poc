ENGLEWOOD CLIFFS, N.J., January 23, 2018 â€” CNBC, First in Business Worldwide, today announced it is accepting nominations for its sixth annual CNBC Disruptor 50, an exclusive list of the most ambitious, innovative private companies transforming the economy and forcing public giants to rethink the way they do business.
The deadline to submit the nomination form is Friday, February 9, 2018 at 8:00pm ET. As in previous years, all private, independently-owned companies are eligible to submit, and any company founder or executive, representative of the company, or investors in the company are welcome to complete the nomination form.
