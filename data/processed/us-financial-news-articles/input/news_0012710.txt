BEIJING, Jan 8 (Reuters) -
* Guangdong Wen’s Foodstuff says 2017 net profits will fall by between 40.6 percent and 44.02 percent from the previous year to between 6.6 billion yuan ($1.02 billion)and 7 billion yuan
* Profit decline is due to a 30 percent drop in poultry selling prices during the year following the outbreak of H7N9 bird flu
* An 18.6 percent drop in selling prices for pigs also contributed to the smaller profits, even as total sales and average weights increased
* About a quarter of Wen’s income comes from poultry meat, with the rest from pork
* The company said last year it was switching to new broiler breeds and expanding sales of chilled poultry meat to counter slowing demand from live chickens
