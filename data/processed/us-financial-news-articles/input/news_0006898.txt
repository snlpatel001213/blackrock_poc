Revenues are only posted and distributed when they are received. Most energy companies normally issue payment of royalties on or about the 25 th of every month, and depending on mail delivery, a varying amount of royalties are not received until after the revenue posting on the last business day of the month. The revenues received after that date will be posted within 30 days of receipt.
Due to the timing of the end of the month of December, approximately $571,000 of revenue received will be posted in the following month of January in addition to normal receipts during January. Since the close of business in December and prior to this press release, approximately $1,663,000 in revenue has been received.
Approximately $186,000 for 2017 Ad Valorem taxes was deducted from this month's distribution as compared to $145,000 this time last year. These payments are normal expenditures at this time of year.
The 2017 tax information packets are expected to begin mailing directly to unitholders in early March 2018. A copy of Sabine's 2017 tax information booklet will be posted on Sabine's website by March 1, 2018. In addition to the tax booklet the Sabine website will also offer two simple calculators for computing the income and expense amounts and the cost depletion. The calculators are currently expected to be updated with the 2017 tax information by February 19, 2018.
The January 1, 2017 Reserve Summary has now been posted on the Sabine website at http://www.sbr-sabine.com/ .
