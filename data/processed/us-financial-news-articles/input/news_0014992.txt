The company, owned by Germany’s Schwarz Group, said the busiest day in the period was Dec. 22, while the week starting Dec. 18 was its strongest ever trading week. 
Sales growth at Lidl and its fellow German discounter Aldi outpaced Britain’s “big four” supermarkets over the Christmas period, Kantar Worldpanel said on Tuesday, with each growing sales by 16.8 percent in the 12 weeks to Dec. 31. Reporting by Paul Sandle; editing by Kate Holton
