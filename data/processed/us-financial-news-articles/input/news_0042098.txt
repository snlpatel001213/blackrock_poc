SANTIAGO, Jan 23 (Reuters) - Chile’s conservative President-elect Sebastian Pinera on Tuesday named Senator Baldo Prokurica as incoming mining minister, a key post in the world’s top copper exporter.
Pinera, who won the presidency last month, governed the country from 2010 to 2014. He named his former Finance Minister Felipe Larrain to fill the same spot again in his incoming cabinet.
