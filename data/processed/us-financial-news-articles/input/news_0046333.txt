LONDON (Reuters) - The number of company insolvencies in England and Wales rose to their highest since 2013 last year, while personal insolvencies hit a three-year high, government figures showed on Friday. 
Some 17,243 companies entered insolvency last year, the highest number since 2013 and 4 percent more than in 2016. 
The government agency which published the data said numbers were boosted by two bulk insolvencies caused by a change to tax rules, and that on an underlying basis the total number last year was 15,112, the highest number since 2014. 
Individual insolvencies rose by 9 percent on the year to a three-year high of 99,196. Reporting by David Milliken; Editing by Alistair Smout
