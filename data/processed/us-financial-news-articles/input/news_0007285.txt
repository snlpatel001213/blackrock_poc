* Brent has risen by more than 10 pct since December
* Oil has been supported by OPEC-led cuts, strong economic growth
* Tensions in OPEC-member Iran have also lifted oil prices
* But soaring U.S. crude production could undermine rally
SINGAPORE, Jan 8 (Reuters) - Oil prices firmed on Monday on the back of a slight decline in the number of U.S. rigs drilling for new production, with crude holding just below near three-year highs reached last week.
  were at $61.61 a barrel at 0209 GMT, 17 cents, or 0.3 percent, above their last settlement, and not far off   last week.
Brent crude futures were at $67.74 a barrel, 12 cents, or 0.2 percent, above their last close. Brent hit $68.27 high last week,  
Traders said the gains were due to a slight decline in the number of U.S. rigs drilling for new production, which eased by five in the week to January 5, to 742, according to data from oil services firm Baker Hughes.
Despite this, U.S. production <C-OUT-T-EIA> is expected to break   very soon, largely thanks to soaring output from shale drillers. Only top producers Russia and Saudi Arabia produce more.
Rising U.S. production is the main factor countering production cuts led by the Middle East dominated   Countries (OPEC) and by Russia, which began   2018.
Stephen Innes, head of trading for Asia/Pacific at futures brokerage Oanda in Singapore, said "the OPEC vs shale debate will rage" this year, being a key price driving factor.
However, Innes added that Middle East turmoil would remain a key focus for oil markets, which he warned had the potential to "send oil prices rocketing higher."
