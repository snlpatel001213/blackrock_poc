 13   Vince McMahon announces return of 'reimagined' XFL in 2020 Rory Carroll 1 Min Read 
(Reuters) - The XFL, a short-lived football league that sought to fuse the sport with the over-the-top theatrics of pro wrestling, will return to the gridiron in 2020, World Wrestling Entertainment founder and Chairman Vince McMahon said on Thursday. 
McMahon said the XFL, which originally launched in 2001 and lasted only one season, will kick off with eight teams and will play a “shorter, faster-paced, family-friendly and easier to understand” brand of the game during the NFL’s offseason. 
“It’s still football, but it’s professional football reimagined,” the 72-year-old McMahon told a news conference. 
“The new XFL will be fan-centric with all the things you like to see and less of the things you don‘t,” he said. 
“We’re going to give the game of football back to fans.” 
The announcement comes as the NFL has seen a slide in ratings amid controversy surrounding head injuries and player protests against racial inequality and police brutality during the national anthem. Reporting by Rory Carroll; Editing by Lisa Shumaker
