BEIJING (Reuters) - China’s commerce ministry said on Thursday the United States’ restrictions on tech exports to the country will contribute to the trade deficit it has with China.
The United States’ 301 investigation is harmful to the global trade framework, China’s commerce ministry spokesman Gao Feng said at a regular news briefing.
Gao added that China would take all necessary means to protect rights of Chinese firms with regards to the 301 investigation.
