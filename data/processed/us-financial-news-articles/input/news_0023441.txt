SANTA ANA, Calif., Jan. 16, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Kush Bottles, Inc. (OTCQB: KSHB), a leading provider of packaging, supplies , vaporizers , accessories and branding solutions for the regulated cannabis industry, today reported financial results for its first fiscal quarter of 2018, for the period ended November 30, 2017.
Fiscal First Quarter Financial Summary
Revenue was up 258% Year-over-Year to $8.85 million. Gross margins were 30%, compared with 34% in the prior year period, which is attributed to increased business in the lower margin vaporizer product segment. Net income, including $382,000 in non-cash stock compensation, $202,000 in depreciation and amortization expense and $1.9 million in SG&A, was $94,615 compared to net loss of $161,000 in the fiscal first quarter of 2017. Cash balance was $5.5 million as of November 30, 2017 compared to $0.9 million at August 31, 2017. Working capital was $8.6 million as of November 30, 2017 compared to $3.4 million at August 31, 2017.
Nick Kovacevich, Chairman and CEO of Kush Bottles, commented, "We entered fiscal 2018 with excellent momentum as we saw the impact of the strategic initiatives implemented throughout 2017 start to take hold. Revenues for the first fiscal quarter of 2018 reached approximately $8.85 million, representing a 258% increase compared with fiscal Q1 2017. This strength in the business led to net profits of $94,615 in fiscal Q1 2018. We also saw our cash balance increase to $5.5 million, which we plan to invest towards inventory purchasing, development of proprietary products, and other strategic initiatives."
Mr. Kovacevich continued, "During the first fiscal quarter of 2018, we saw the release of California's new temporary regulations for medical and adult-use cannabis sales, which took effect on January 1, 2018. California is not only the U.S.'s largest cannabis market, but also our home market where we have already extensively invested in sales, marketing and infrastructure. We consider the legalization of adult-use cannabis sales to be a major opportunity to scale the business throughout 2018 and beyond, and we have made significant headway to establish the Company as a leader in this market. Many of our clients have been granted temporary licenses and we are working with them closely during this hectic transition period as California finalizes its permanent regulations over the next 6 to 12 months."
