Temperatures get down to minus 12 degrees Fahrenheit during a typical January day, but temperatures as low as minus 44 F have been recorded there. A post shared by Khouanetheva (Coco) Pholsena (@cocoph8l) on Jan 17, 2018 at 3:41am PST The Coldest Uninhabited Place on Earth 
The absolute coldest place on Earth is in Antarctica, where Scientists at the National Snow and Ice Data Center used satellites to measure the lowest recorded temperature ever at minus-133.6 degrees Fahrenheit . 
Humans could survive in those kinds of temperatures, but only for about three minutes . A windchill of just minus 50 degrees Fahrenheit can cause frostbite in about five minutes . 
“Humans really have no place there,” one of the researchers said. SPONSORED FINANCIAL CONTENT
