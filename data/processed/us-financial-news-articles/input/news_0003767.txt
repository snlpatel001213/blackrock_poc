 U.S. congressional Democratic leaders said Wednesday they had a productive meeting with leaders of the Republican majority and White House officials about spending issues ahead of a Jan. 19 deadline to keep the government funded.
“We had a positive and productive meeting and all parties have agreed to continue discussing a path forward to quickly resolve all of the issues ahead of us,” Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer and House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi said in a statement.
The statement was issued after a meeting of over an hour on Capitol Hill attended by Schumer, Pelosi, House Speaker Paul Ryan, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and two White House officials - legislative director Marc Short and budget director Mick Mulvaney.
