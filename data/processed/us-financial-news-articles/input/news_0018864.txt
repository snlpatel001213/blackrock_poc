The Company noted that its revenue, sales and profit expectations are estimated and preliminary and subject to quarter and year-end closing adjustments. As the Company has not completed its quarter and year-end fiscal close or the audit of its 2017 financial statements, the revenue, sales and profit expectations presented in this press release may change.
Sharon Price John, Build-A-Bear Workshop Chief Executive Officer commented, “Although we were successfully able to move forward on a number of our stated strategic initiatives for the year and the quarter, our estimated revenue did not meet our expectations. However, because of our ongoing operational improvements, we expect to deliver our pre-tax profit within guidance. We also began to realize the initial benefits of the new web platform that was launched in the fourth quarter with E-commerce sales rising double-digits. In addition to the website launch, we continued to transition our real estate portfolio to be more aligned to the evolving consumer shopping patterns and accelerated the development of new relationships to increase the diversification of revenue streams, including our recent announcement of a new Chinese franchise partnership. With a strong balance sheet and positive cash flow, we believe we are well-positioned to continue to evolve the company to be able to leverage the strength of the Build-A-Bear brand.”

*Given the potential impact of anticipated accounting changes and recent tax changes, the Company will provide further specificity with regard to its expectations for EBIT and EPS growth when it reports fiscal 2017 results in February.
Fiscal Year Change

Corporate Tax Reform
On December 22, 2017, H.R.1 - An Act to provide for reconciliation pursuant to titles II and V of the concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2018, also known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, (the “Act”) was enacted which among other items reduces the federal corporate tax rate to 21% effective January 1, 2018. The Company is currently reviewing the components of the Act and evaluating its impact, which could have a material negative effect on the Company’s fiscal year 2017 consolidated financial statements and related disclosures, including a one-time, non-cash expense related to a decrease in the value of the Company’s net deferred tax assets.
