The Trump administration wants to open up nearly all the country’s offshore areas for oil drilling, leasing areas off places like Florida and California for the first time in decades, and reversing an Obama-era policy. 
Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke announced Thursday that his department is planning the largest number of oil-lease sales in U.S. history starting next year. It would open up 90% of offshore land for drilling as part of a five-year plan. It reverses an Obama-era plan that would have kept only 6% of the same acres available for drilling. 
“We’re going to become the strongest energy super power,” Zinke said in a call with reporters. “We certainly have the assets to do that.”
