Terms were renegotiated after union members rejected an earlier tentative deal in late December, marking the first time the South Korean automaker failed to reach a wage deal by the end of the year. 
The agreement will allow Hyundai to focus on improving sales after a slump in 2017 when China sales were hit by a diplomatic row between Beijing and Seoul over South Korea’s deployment of a U.S. anti-missile defence system. 
The union said in a statement that 61.1 percent of voters approved the deal whereas 38.4 percent rejected the terms. The remaining votes were invalid.
