DUBLIN (Reuters) - Unions representing Ryanair ( RYA.I ) pilots told management on Wednesday they wanted to meet on a collective basis as they were unhappy with the progress of individual talks, according to a letter sent to the Irish airline by the European Cockpit Association (ECA). 
The letter, which was on ECA notepaper and was signed by 11 trade unions, also demanded that Ryanair commit by March 1 to permanent direct employment contracts in accordance with the local laws of the country where they are based. 
Ryanair in a statement said “Ryanair won’t be meeting with any collective group of competitor pilot unions” and said such a grouping would have no legal standing or negotiating licence. 
Spokesmen for the ECA and Irish trade union IMPACT declined to comment on whether the letter, seen by Reuters, represented their views. Reporting by Conor Humphries; Editing by Susan Fenton
