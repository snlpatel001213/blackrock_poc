Nick Cousins scored his second goal of the game 2:21 into overtime Monday night, lifting the Arizona Coyotes to a 3-2 win over the New York Islanders at Gila River Arena in Glendale, Ariz.
Cousins’ seventh goal of the season was set up by Christian Fischer, who took the puck away and fed Cousins for a backhander that gave Arizona its second straight win. It was just the Coyotes’ 12th victory in 49 games, allowing them to snap a tie with Buffalo for the fewest points in the NHL.
New York forced overtime with Anthony Beauvillier’s second goal of the game and 12th of the season at 2:53 of the third period, giving him seven markers in the last six games. Beauvillier collected the rebound of Thomas Hickey’s shot in the right circle and roofed a one-timer over Antti Raanta.
That allowed the Islanders to salvage a point for extending the game past regulation, but they weren’t able to get the extra point for winning. Their 53 points is one out of the Eastern Conference’s final playoff berth.
Arizona carried play for most of the first two periods, looking nothing like the Western Conference’s worst team. The Coyotes parlayed an 8-1 shots advantage to start the game into the first goal. Cousins collected a loose puck near the lower edge of the left circle and squeezed a shot through Jaroslav Halak’s pads for his sixth goal at 12:20 of the first period.
The Islanders tied it 34 seconds into the second period with a quick counterattack. After a pair of saves by Halak, Josh Bailey fired a stretch pass to Beauvillier. He skated down the right wing and ripped a wrister that Raanta saved, but couldn’t control. Beauvillier potted the rebound.
However, Arizona regained the lead almost halfway through the period when Brendan Perlini scored a goal for the third straight game. Luke Schenn took a shot from the point that Perlini tipped by Halak for his 13th goal at 9:52.
Raanta stopped 32 shots to earn the win. Halak made 30 saves in defeat.
