KABUL (Reuters) - The casualty toll in Saturdayâ€™s ambulance bomb attack in the Afghan capital Kabul has risen to at least 63 dead and 151 wounded, but the total may rise further, a health ministry official said.
The Taliban claimed responsibility for the blast, a week after it claimed an attack on the Intercontinental Hotel in Kabul in which more than 20 people were killed.
