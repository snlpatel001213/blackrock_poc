MILWAUKEE, Jan. 31, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- WEC Energy Group (NYSE: WEC) recorded net income based on generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) of $1.20 billion or $3.79 per share for 2017. This compares to earnings of $939 million or $2.96 per share for 2016.
The 2017 results include earnings from recurring operations of $3.14 per share and the net impact of one-time, non-cash adjustments totaling 65 cents per share. These one-time adjustments reflect the application of the new tax law to the company's non-utility assets and to the assets of the parent company.
Adjusted earnings were $3.14 per share for 2017 versus adjusted earnings of $2.97 in 2016.
"These latest results reflect a disciplined focus on cost control, efficiency gains and executing on the fundamentals of our business," said Gale Klappa, chairman and chief executive officer.
For the fourth quarter of 2017, WEC Energy Group recorded net income based on GAAP of $432.6 million or $1.36 per share. This compares to earnings of $194.4 million or 61 cents per share for the fourth quarter of the previous year.
Results for the fourth quarter of 2017 include one-time, non-cash adjustments of 65 cents per share related to the new tax law. Excluding this amount, WEC Energy Group's adjusted earnings for the fourth quarter of 2017 were 71 cents per share. Comparable results for the fourth quarter of 2016 totaled 61 cents per share with no adjustments.
"On virtually every meaningful measure – from network reliability to customer satisfaction to community involvement – the company continued to perform at a high level during 2017," Klappa said.
We Energies, WEC Energy Group's largest utility, was recognized as the most reliable utility in America in 2017 and the best in the Midwest for the seventh year in a row by PA Consulting, an independent firm that analyzes data on electric outages, restoration times and service quality.
At the end of 2017, WEC Energy Group utilities were serving approximately 11,000 more electric and 20,000 more natural gas customers than at the same time a year ago.
For the full year, retail deliveries of electricity for the Wisconsin and Michigan utilities – excluding the iron ore mine in Michigan's Upper Peninsula – were down by 1.6 percent. Residential electricity use decreased by 3.3 percent. Electricity consumption by small commercial and industrial customers declined by 1.4 percent.
Electricity use by large commercial and industrial customers – excluding the iron ore mine – decreased by 0.4 percent during 2017.
These decreases were driven by significantly cooler summer temperatures compared to the summer of 2016.
On a weather-normal basis for 2017, retail deliveries of electricity – excluding the iron ore mine – decreased by 0.4 percent. "We continue to work with our customers on the efficient use of electricity as they grow their businesses," Klappa said.
Natural gas deliveries in Wisconsin, excluding gas used for power generation, rose by 4.3 percent during 2017. On a weather-normal basis, natural gas deliveries grew by 3.7 percent during the year.
"The company is introducing 2018 earnings guidance in the range of $3.26 to $3.30 per share – in line with our long-term goal of growing earnings at a rate of 5 to 7 percent per year," Klappa said.
The tables below include a reconciliation of GAAP to adjusted earnings.

Non-GAAP earnings measures
We have provided adjusted earnings (non-GAAP earnings) in this press release as a complement to, and not as an alternative to, reported earnings presented in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted earnings exclude a one-time reduction in income tax expense related to a revaluation of our deferred taxes as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 as well as costs related to the acquisition of Integrys, neither of which is indicative of the company's operating performance. Therefore, we believe that the presentation of adjusted earnings is relevant and useful to investors to understand WEC Energy Group's operating performance. Management uses such measures internally to evaluate the company's performance and manage its operations.
