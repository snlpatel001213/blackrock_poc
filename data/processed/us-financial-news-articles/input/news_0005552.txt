One lucky person in Florida will walk away with Mega Millions’ $450 million jackpot, after his or her winning ticket broke the game’s dry spell on Friday . 
A single ticket sold at a Port Richey, Fla., 7-Eleven matched all six Mega Millions numbers — white balls 28, 30, 39, 59 and 70, as well as Mega Ball 10 — during Friday night’s drawing, according to Mega Millions . The winner, who has not yet been named, will claim the $450 million jackpot, or about $281 million cash, and the 7-Eleven that sold the ticket will get $100,000 in commission. 
Nearly 3 million ticket holders won prizes of varying value on Friday, including the jackpot winner and eight tickets that matched five of six numbers, according to Mega Millions . The game’s jackpot is now back down to $40 million ahead of Tuesday night’s drawing.
