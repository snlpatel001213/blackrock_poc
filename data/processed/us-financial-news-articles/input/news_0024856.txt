TORONTO, Jan. 15, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Mandalay Resources Corporation ("Mandalay" or the "Company") (TSX:MND) announced today its production and sales results for the fourth quarter of 2017.
In the fourth quarter of 2017, Mandalay produced a consolidated 34,395 saleable ounces of gold equivalent and sold 29,547 ounces of gold equivalent. For the full year ended December 31, 2017, Mandalay produced 131,186 saleable ounces of gold equivalent and sold 127,367 ounces of gold equivalent.
Mark Sander, President and Chief Executive Officer of Mandalay, commented, “The Company’s superb fourth quarter performance at Björkdal, in which it produced 22,035 ounces of gold, enabled Mandalay to beat its annual consolidated revised guidance issued on August 10, 2017. The Björkdal result for the quarter is a record under Mandalay ownership, more than double the production of the year-ago quarter. On an annual basis, the total 62,028 ounces produced by Björkdal in 2017 is not only 30% greater than in the previous year, but is also the highest production from the mine since 1998. This performance is due to continued grade control discipline and the ability of the mine to deliver larger quantities of highest quality “A” ore to the plant. As well, we received a boost from positive reconciliations of mined “A” ore grades to our block model in the quarter.
“Costerfield produced 12,360 gold equivalent ounces in the fourth quarter of 2017 and 52,137 gold equivalent ounces for the full year. The fourth quarter production was similar to that of the fourth quarter of 2016; it remains consistent with the previous three quarters of this year and also with the current grade profile of the mine. We are on track with respect to the capital development program, announced in November, 2017, to reach the Brunswick vein and extend mine life.”
Dr. Sander continued, “At Cerro Bayo, where production has remained suspended since the June 9, 2017, inundation, a diligent and committed permitting process is underway to work with regulators to receive the outstanding permits necessary to restart the mine and complete the life of mine plan.”
Dr. Sander concluded, “Lastly, I am delighted to note that Mandalay’s consolidated production from our two currently producing assets during the fourth quarter of 2017 was higher than in the fourth quarter of 2016, when all three mines were operating. This resiliency is characteristic of our multi-mine Company and, more importantly, of our people.”

Average Au price in the period is calculated as the average of the daily LME PM fixes in the period, with price on weekend days and holidays taken of the last business day; average Sb price in the period is calculated as the average of the daily average of the high and low Rotterdam warehouse prices for all days in the period, with price on weekend days and holidays taken from the last business day; average Ag price in the period is calculated as the average of the daily London Broker’s silver spot price for all days in the period, with price on weekend days and holidays taken from the last business day.
