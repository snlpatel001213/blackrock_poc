ISTANBUL (Reuters) - A senior Turkish government official said on Wednesday that the conviction of Turkish banker Hakan Atilla in the United States violated international law.
A U.S. jury on Wednesday found Atilla, an executive at Turkeyâ€™s majority state-owned Halkbank ( HALKB.IS ), guilty of helping Iran evade U.S. sanctions.
The official told Reuters the outcome of the trial would not hurt the Turkish economy, banking system or Halkbank.
