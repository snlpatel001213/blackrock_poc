SCOTTSDALE, Ariz., Jan. 11, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Taylor Morrison Home Corporation ("Taylor Morrison") (NYSE:TMHC), today announced the commencement of an underwritten public offering of 19,206,656 shares of its Class A common stock.
The offering consists of 17,706,924 shares of Class A common stock to be issued and sold by Taylor Morrison and an additional 1,499,732 shares of Taylor Morrison's Class A common stock to be sold by affiliates of and funds managed by TPG Global, LLC, one of Taylor Morrison's equity sponsors.
Taylor Morrison intends to use all of the net proceeds that it receives from the offering to purchase partnership units in its direct subsidiary - TMM Holdings II Limited Partnership - along with shares of Taylor Morrison's Class B common stock, held by its current equity sponsors that are affiliates of and funds managed by TPG Global, LLC and Oaktree Capital Management, L.P. The aggregate number of partnership units and corresponding shares of Class B common stock purchased by Taylor Morrison will be equal to the number of shares of Class A common stock sold in the offering. Taylor Morrison will not receive any proceeds from the sale of the 1,499,732 shares of Class A common stock sold by the selling stockholders in the offering.
In addition, in a separate privately negotiated transaction, Taylor Morrison intends to purchase an additional 3,750,000 partnership units and corresponding shares of Class B common stock from the equity sponsors at a purchase price per unit equal to the price per share paid by the underwriters for the Class A common stock in the public offering. The consummation of the unit repurchase from the equity sponsors is subject to certain conditions, including the consummation of the public offering.
Following the completion of the transactions described above, the equity sponsors will no longer beneficially own any of the Company's common stock. As a result, our equity sponsors will no longer be entitled to any designees on the Company's board of directors, and the Company expects that Jason Keller, James Sholem, Kelvin Davis and Rajath Shourie will resign from the Company's board of directors.
The existing $100 million repurchase authorization under Taylor Morrison's stock repurchase program will not be reduced by the sponsor equity repurchase and such authorization will remain in effect thereafter, subject to the existing terms and conditions of such repurchase program.
Citigroup and Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC are acting as joint book-running managers and underwriters for the proposed public offering, and may offer the shares of Class A common stock purchased by them from Taylor Morrison and the selling stockholders from time to time in one or more transactions on the NYSE, in the over-the-counter market or through negotiated transactions at market prices or negotiated prices.
