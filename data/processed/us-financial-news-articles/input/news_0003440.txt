MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe broke a new record, .MIWD PUS last gaining 0.83 percent. 
The ADP National Employment Report on Thursday showed that U.S. private employers added 250,000 jobs in December, marking the biggest monthly increase since March. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 161.5 points, or 0.65 percent, to 25,084.18, sailing past the 25,000-mark for the first time. 
“With the Dow Jones hitting 25,000 for the first time, there seems no end in sight to a stock market rally spurred on by much stronger-than-expected jobs data for December, offering yet further evidence of the strength of the U.S. economy,” said Jacob Deppe, head of trading at online trading platform Infinox in London, in a note. 
The S&P 500 .SPX gained 13.82 points, or 0.51 percent, to 2,726.88 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 14.07 points, or 0.2 percent, to 7,079.60, with both indexes hitting fresh highs. 
Separately, China’s services sector activity hit its highest level in more than three years and manufacturing data from Japan came in strong. Services PMI data also showed the euro area was close to its best growth in seven years, confirming a strengthening economy was boosting corporate activity. 
The euro zone's STOXX 50 .STOXX50E had its best day since April 2017, closing up 1.68 percent. London's FTSE .FTSE set a record on Thursday, up 0.32 percent, while Tokyo's Nikkei .N225 - Asia's biggest market - had earlier shot to its highest since 1992 and was up 3.26 percent. 
MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan .MIAPJ0000PUS closed up 0.49 percent, scaling a decade-high peak as a fifth day of gains in China helped emerging market stocks .MSCIEF to a six-and-a-half year high. 
Those gains come after Wednesday’s release of the minutes from the Federal Reserve’s mid-December meeting that did little to change a view that it will stick to measured increases in U.S. interest rates. Slideshow (2 Images) 
The minutes showed policymakers expect U.S. President Donald Trump’s tax overhaul will boost consumer spending but are still uncertain about the wider impact the stimulus would have on factors such as inflation. EURO RALLIES 
The euro resumed a rally that has taken it near its highest levels in three years, while the U.S. dollar index .DXY, which measures the greenback against a basket of major currencies, failed to hold its previous session’s gains after upbeat U.S. data and minutes from the Federal Reserve.
