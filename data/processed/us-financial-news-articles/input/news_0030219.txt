Twenty-First Century Fox : "I think it's fine. I think the stub is going to be worth a lot. I do absolutely prefer Disney . Why not go buy Disney? That's the better [option]."
Chimera Investment Corp. : "You can never even tell what they own. And I'm not going to recommend the stock of a company where I do not know what they own."
Intel : "That stuff [about faulty chips] is nonsense. There was some degradation. It will not even matter. You will not look back. You will not be able to see why that stock went down. I trust [CEO] Brian Krzanich. He's a good man. If he tells me the problem's solved, the problem is solved."
Exelon Corporation : "No, I prefer to make [mad money] in Dominion , American Electric Power , which has come down a great deal, or ConEd , which has also gotten hammered."
