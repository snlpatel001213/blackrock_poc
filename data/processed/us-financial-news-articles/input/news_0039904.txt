ZURICH, Jan 24 (Reuters) - Swiss chocolate maker Barry Callebaut said it expected the market recovery to continue after sales volumes rose 8 percent in the first quarter of its fiscal year, helped by renewed global appetite for confectionery.
Global chocolate confectionery grew 3.1 percent in the three months to Nov. 30, according to Nielsen data, and Barry Callebaut is also benefiting from big food groups like Nestle and Mondelez outsourcing chocolate production.
“We have good visibility on our sales portfolio and expect the market recovery to continue,” Barry Callebaut Chief Executive Antoine de Saint-Affrique said in a statement on Wednesday, adding the company was on track to deliver on its mid-term guidance.
