After reading Barton Swaim’s excellent review of Michael Wolff’s instant best seller “Fire and Fury” (Bookshelf, Jan. 8), I couldn’t help but think of how prescient William Shakespeare was when Macbeth says, “It is a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.” How could he have so well anticipated “Fire and Fury”? Amazing.
