WASHINGTON, Jan 18 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump backs a short-term bill to fund the U.S. government that the House of Representatives will vote on Thursday to avert a government shutdown, the White House said after a presidential tweet cast doubt on his support.
“The president supports the continuing resolution introduced in the House,” White House spokesman Raj Shah said in a statement.
Questions about Trump’s support arose earlier on Thursday after he said on Twitter that a children’s healthcare provision in the stopgap legislation should be part of a long-term solution not a short-term bill. (Reporting by Steve Holland; Writing by Doina Chiacu; Editing by)
