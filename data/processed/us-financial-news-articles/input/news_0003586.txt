Dembele, who joined Barcelona for a 105 million euro ($126.60 million) fee that could rise to 147 million, from Borussia Dortmund in August, made only three appearances for the La Liga side before rupturing his hamstring against Getafe on Sept. 16. 
The 20-year-old French forward, who had a surgery in Finland, returned to training in December and received his medical discharge on Tuesday.

They will also return to league action with a home game against Levante on Sunday. Reporting by Hardik Vyas in Bengaluru
