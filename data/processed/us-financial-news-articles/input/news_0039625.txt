Jan 23 (Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court on Tuesday upheld a ruling that invalidated a crucial Johnson & Johnson patent on its blockbuster rheumatoid arthritis drug Remicade, limiting J&Jâ€™s ability to seek damages from Pfizer Inc over its launch of a lower-cost version of the drug. 
The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed a ruling by a U.S. administrative court that a J&J patent covering the active ingredient in Remicade was invalid because it was based on an obvious concept. (Reporting by Jan Wolfe)
