The Company has declared a cash dividend of $0.05 per share, to be paid on February 22, 2018, to shareholders of record as of the close of business on February 12, 2018.
"2017 was a pivotal year for SC, and our full year results reflect that," said Scott Powell, SC President and CEO, and Santander US CEO. "We strengthened our management team, stabilized credit performance, and launched new efforts focusing on Fiat Chrysler and the rest of our dealers. Passing the Federal Reserve's capital stress test and our relationship with Santander Group provide us with the balance sheet flexibility to support our business objectives in 2018."
2017 Regulatory and Business Milestones:
The Federal Reserve Bank of Boston ("Federal Reserve") terminated the 2014 Written Agreement with SC's majority owner, Santander Holdings USA, Inc. ("SHUSA"), following its non-objection to SHUSA's Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review submission. SHUSA and SC now operate within a normal capital cycle, and SC completed its first cash dividend payment to shareholders since 2014. SHUSA and Banco Santander ("Santander") increased their total ownership in SC to approximately 68.1%, following Santander's acquisition from SC's former CEO of 9.6% of SC's outstanding shares, which it transferred to SHUSA. Launched flow program with Santander allowing SC to execute prime auto loan sales of $2.6 billion, and through Santander Bank N.A., increased FCA dealer receivables ("floorplan") 14% year-over-year, to $2.0 billion. Leading auto loan asset-backed securities ("ABS") issuer with $7.9 billion in ABS offered and sold, including SC's inaugural lease securitization, Santander Retail Auto Lease Trust ("SRT") and SC's first public DRIVE securitization. Announced key appointments and changes to its management team, including Scott Powell as CEO, Juan Carlos Alvarez as CFO, Sandra Broderick as EVP, Head of Operations, and Rich Morrin, as President of Chrysler Capital and Auto Relationships.

"Fourth quarter results demonstrate continued stabilization in credit performance following Hurricanes Harvey and Irma," said Juan Carlos Alvarez, SC CFO. "As we head into 2018 our goal is to leverage our network and improve our dealer experience, including with Fiat Chrysler, while remaining focused on risk-adjusted returns and disciplined expense management."
Net finance and other interest income decreased 11 percent, to $1.0 billion in Q4 2017 from $1.1 billion in Q4 2016, primarily driven by lower average RIC balances and an increase in benchmark rates.
Servicing fee income decreased 19 percent to $26 million in Q4 2017, from $32 million in Q4 2016, driven by lower prime originations and lower prime asset sales. SC's serviced for others portfolio of $8.6 billion as of Q4 2017, is down 28 percent from $11.9 billion in Q4 2016.
RIC delinquency ratio 3 increased to 5.4 percent in Q4 2017, from 5.1 percent in Q4 2016, primarily due to a lower portfolio balance.
RIC net charge-off ratio 4 increased to 10.3 percent in Q4 2017, from 9.9 percent in Q4 2016. Provision for credit loss decreased to $562 million in Q4 2017, from $686 million in Q4 2016.

Recorded net investment losses were $138 million in Q4 2017, compared to net investment losses of $168 million in Q4 2016. The current period losses were primarily driven by held for sale accounting for SC's personal lending portfolio 6 .
During the quarter, SC incurred $426 million of operating expenses, up 44 percent from $296 million in Q4 2016. Adjusted operating expenses were $269 million, down 9 percent from $296 million in Q4 2016.
1 Please refer to Table 9 for a reconciliation of these significant items to GAAP.

2 Includes Finance receivables held for investment, Finance receivables held for sale and Leased vehicles.
3 Delinquency ratio is defined as the ratio of end of period delinquent principal over 60 days to end of period gross balance of the respective portfolio, excluding capital leases.
4 Net charge-off ratio stated on a recorded investment basis, which is the unpaid principal balance adjusted for unaccreted net discounts, subvention and origination costs.
5 Ratio for allowance for credit losses excludes end of period balances on purchased receivables portfolio of $28 million and finance receivables held for sale of $2.2 billion.
6 The current period losses were primarily driven by $136 million of lower of cost or market adjustments related to the held for sale personal lending portfolio, comprised of $114 million in customer default activity and $23 million increase in market discount, consistent with typical seasonal patterns.

Under the banking agencies' risk-based capital guidelines, assets and credit equivalent amounts of derivatives and off-balance sheet exposures are assigned to broad risk categories. The aggregate dollar amount in each risk category is multiplied by the associated risk weight of the category. The resulting weighted values are added together with the measure for market risk, resulting in the Company's total Risk weighted assets.
(b)
CET1 is calculated under Basel III regulations required as of January 1, 2015. The fully phased-in capital ratios are non-GAAP financial measures.
(c)
Net tax benefit due to re-measurement of all deferred tax assets (DTAs) and deferred tax liabilities (DTLs) at a federal tax rate of 21% (as compared to 35%).
