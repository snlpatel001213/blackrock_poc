JOHANNESBURG, Jan 30 (Reuters) - South African state-run power utility Eskom said on Tuesday interim profits were down 34 percent to 6 billion rand ($504 million) on the back of declining sales and higher finance costs.
Eskom, which has been embroiled in a governance crisis and allegations of undue influence in awarding tenders, said in a statement it would address governance concerns and stabilise the firm through its new board.
