MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia’s central bank may lower its key rate once Russians get accustomed to macro-economic stability, President Vladimir Putin said on Tuesday.
“We have managed to lower inflation to a historic minimum of 2.5 percent... People need to get used to the fact that the situation is stable. Then the bank will start lowering its rate,” the president said.
