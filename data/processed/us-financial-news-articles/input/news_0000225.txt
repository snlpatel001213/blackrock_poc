Management Comment
Todd Denkin, Digipath's President & COO, commented, "We are extremely pleased with our results for fiscal 2017 and look forward to a full year of testing for both medical and recreational cannabis products in 2018. It is also rewarding to see our progress reflected in our recent stock price. Over $126 million of cannabis-related products have been sold in Nevada since adult use went into effect on July 1, 2017. People don't realize that Nevada had more sales than Colorado experienced in their first four months of adult-use cannabis. We anticipate a continued significant increase in demand for cannabis lab testing services in 2018. In addition, with recreational cannabis now legal in California, we continue to work with our previously announced joint venture partner to launch an independent testing lab in California during 2018 as we seek to replicate our successful Nevada operations in other legal jurisdictions."
Adjusted EBITDA
We define Adjusted EBITDA as net earnings (loss) before (i) other income (expense), (ii) interest income, (iii) interest expense, (iv) bad debts, (v) depreciation and amortization, (vi) impairment of securities available-for-sale costs, (vii) non-cash expenses relating to share based payments recognized under ASC Topic 718, (viii) gain on early extinguishment of debt, and (ix) equity in losses of unconsolidated entity. We believe the use of this non-GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors regarding our current financial performance; however, Adjusted EBITDA does not represent, and should not be considered an alternative to GAAP measurements. Specifically, we believe Adjusted EBITDA results provide useful information to both management and investors by excluding certain income and expenses that our management believes are not indicative of our core operating results, we believe that non-GAAP financial measures have limitations and do not reflect all of the amounts associated with our results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP and that Adjusted EBITDA should only be used to evaluate our results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net loss is included below:
