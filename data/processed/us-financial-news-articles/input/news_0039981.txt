Blanchett, who has won two Oscars, was named a goodwill ambassador for United Nations refugee agency UNHCR in May 2016. As part of her role, the actor has travelled to Lebanon and Jordan to meet refugees displaced by the Syrian conflict. 
She warned of the consequences if more was not done to help people forced to flee their homes. 
“Lost generations of uneducated, disenfranchised and displaced children not only represent a vast loss of potential but also a threat for future global security and prosperity,” she said. 
More than a million people have fled parts of Africa and the Middle East to Europe in the last few years. Reporting by Alexis Akwagyiram in Davos Editing by Jeremy Gaunt
