Fourth Quarter 2017 vs. Third Quarter 2017
Key Highlights
Fourth quarter highlights include ROTCE of 19.9% and Underlying ROTCE* of 10.4%. Underlying results* reflect revenue growth of 2% driven by strength in net interest income given continued loan growth and a three basis point improvement in net interest margin. Provision expense increased modestly from relatively low third quarter levels. Results reflect an efficiency ratio of 61%, which includes the impact of $40 million of notable expense items.
On an Underlying basis,* operating leverage was 1.6% and the efficiency ratio improved 91 basis points to 58.5%. Tangible book value per common share of $27.48 increased by 2%. Fully diluted average common shares outstanding decreased by 8.4 million shares.
