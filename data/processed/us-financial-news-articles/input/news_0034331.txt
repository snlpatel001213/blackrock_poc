TORONTO, Jan 18 (Reuters) - Canadian cannabis producer CanniMed Therapeutics Inc has postponed to Jan. 25 a shareholder vote on its proposed takeover of Newstrike Resources Ltd in order to discuss a possible transaction with rival producer Aurora Cannabis Inc.
Aurora, which launched a hostile bid for CanniMed in November, and CanniMed have agreed to a standstill agreement, under which neither will solicit proxies or seek control of any additional shares of the target until Jan. 21 at 11:59 p.m., CanniMed said in a statement on Thursday.
