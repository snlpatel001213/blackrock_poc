Two protesters died overnight in southwestern Iran, an Iranian lawmaker said Monday, as the country’s most widespread demonstrations in almost a decade appeared set to continue for a fifth day despite government warnings. 
The people were shot dead in Izeh during protests Sunday night over economic conditions, Hedayatollah Khademi, a member of parliament from the area, told the semiofficial Iranian Labor News Agency. He said he didn’t know if they were killed by police, but that the matter was under investigation.

The deaths bring to four the number of confirmed dead in protests that have rocked Iran in recent days, presenting a formidable challenge to the country’s Islamic ruling system. Two other protesters were killed in Dorood, a city in western Iran, on Saturday, according to a provincial official. 
Police have arrested more than 350 people, and the Interior Ministry has repeatedly warned that violence and vandalism won’t be tolerated, but have so far failed to deter protesters.
