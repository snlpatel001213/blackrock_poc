The multi-year deal will allow artists associated with Sony/ATV — whose catalogue includes Bob Dylan, Taylor Swift and Ed Sheeran — to earn royalties from the use of their music on the social media platforms. 
Facebook’s deal with Sony/ATV follows a similar deal with Universal Music Group in December, to retain users and attract advertisers. Reporting by Sonam Rai in Bengaluru; Editing by Shounak Dasgupta
