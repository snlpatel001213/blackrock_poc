WASHINGTON, Jan 16 (Reuters) - U.S. Democratic Representative Michelle Lujan Grisham, head of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, expressed opposition on Tuesday to a bipartisan Senate immigration deal set to be unveiled on Wednesday.
Lujan Grisham said in a hallway interview that the Senate measure would make parents of “Dreamers” - people brought illegally to the country as children - “second-class citizens” and had other problems “that would give me both as a member (of Congress) and as the chairwoman of the caucus heartburn.”
Lujan Grisham has thrown her weight behind a bipartisan bill being introduced in the House of Representatives that is narrower than the Senate bill and would not address all the immigration issues being sought by the White House.
