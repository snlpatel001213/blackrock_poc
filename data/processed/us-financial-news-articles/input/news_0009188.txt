NEW YORK, Jan. 10, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- In conjunction with hosting its Analyst Day on January 10, 2018, Solar Senior Capital Ltd. (NASDAQ:SUNS) (“Solar Senior” or the “Company”) is hereby disclosing certain estimated results for the quarter ended December 31, 2017.
For the quarter ended December 31, 2017, management expects the Company’s net investment income per share to be $0.35, consistent with $0.35 for the quarter ended September 30, 2017. Approximately $0.3 million of performance-based incentive fees were voluntarily waived by the Company’s investment manager for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 compared to $0.7 million of management fees and performance-based incentive fees waived in Q3 2017. The reduced fee waiver in Q4 2017 is a direct result of the Company generating higher gross investment income due to its net portfolio growth as well as an increase in the weighted average portfolio yield primarily attributable to its recent acquisition of North Mill Capital LLC.
Management expects the Company’s net asset value per share at December 31, 2017 to be in the range of $16.81 to $16.84 compared to the net asset value per share of $16.81 as of September 30, 2017.
For the quarter ended December 31, 2017, the Company’s comprehensive portfolio activity 1 includes investments of approximately $85 million and prepayments and other exits of approximately $52 million. In addition, management expects the Company’s net debt/equity ratio to be approximately 0.45x at December 31, 2017.
At December 31, 2017, the Company had no investments on non-accrual.
On October 24, 2017, the Company announced that it acquired 100% of the equity interests of North Mill Capital LLC (“North Mill”). North Mill is a leading asset-based lending commercial finance company that provides senior secured asset-backed financings to U.S. based small-to-medium sized businesses primarily in the manufacturing, services and distribution industries. The acquisition further diversifies and expands the Company’s senior secured direct lending investment channels, provides differentiated sources of growth, and increases the earnings power of Solar Senior’s portfolio.
Additionally, on January 5, 2018, the Board declared a distribution of $0.1175 per share for the month of January 2018. The distribution is payable on January 31, 2018 to stockholders of record as of January 18, 2018.
