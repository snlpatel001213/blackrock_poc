TORONTO, Jan 15 (Reuters) - Canada’s main stock index ended higher on Monday, boosted by sharp jumps for cannabis stocks after a sell-off last week and by gains for major gold miners as the price of the precious metal hit a four-month high.
The Toronto Stock Exchange’s S&P/TSX composite index unofficially closed up 63.63 points, or 0.39 percent, at 16,371.81. Seven of its 10 main sectors rose. (Reporting by Alastair Sharp; Editing by Lisa Shumaker)
