SAN FRANCISCO, Jan. 31, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ForgeRock®, the leading platform provider of digital identity management solutions, today announced the appointment of Peter Barker as chief product officer. Barker joins ForgeRock from Oracle, where he served as senior vice president and general manager of the Identity Management and Security business. Barker is based in Austin, Texas and will report to John Fernandez, ForgeRock’s interim chief executive officer and chief financial officer.
ForgeRock's New Chief Product Officer
As chief product officer, Barker will be responsible for driving ForgeRock’s global product vision, design and development, and he will lead product management and all of engineering. At Oracle, Barker was responsible for the Identity Management and Security software business and transformed the products and organization to a cloud model, which was key to accelerating growth in the business.
“This is a really important executive hire for ForgeRock. With Peter shepherding our strategy and providing additional leadership to the great product and engineering teams we already have - I am even more excited for the road ahead,” said John Fernandez. “Chief product officer is a new position for our company, and we could not have found a better person.”
Barker joins ForgeRock at a time of substantial growth. In 2017, the company’s revenue increased by nearly 50%; it hired more than 200 employees, and operates with a strong balance sheet after having raised $88M in its Series D funding round. ForgeRock is poised to extend its leadership in the surging digital identity market, driven by global organizations’ requirements for enhanced customer engagement and internet of things (IoT).
“My arrival at ForgeRock comes at great time in the company’s development,” said Barker. “The digital identity market is exploding, and ForgeRock has all of the ingredients to win. I’m passionate about this space, and thrilled to join the team.”
