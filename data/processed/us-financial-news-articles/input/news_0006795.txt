For-profit education company Grand Canyon Education Inc. wants its main university to operate as a nonprofit school, less than two years after withdrawing a similar proposal to its accreditor. 
The Phoenix-based company said in a securities filing Friday that the Higher Learning Commission could vote on the application for Grand Canyon University to be classified as a nonprofit institution as early as February.
