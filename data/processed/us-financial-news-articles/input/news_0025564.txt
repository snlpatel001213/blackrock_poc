MOSCOW, Jan 16 (Reuters) - The Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) is considering a secondary share offering in Detsky Mir retailer, RDIFâ€™s president, Kirill Dmitriev, said on Tuesday.
The Sistema conglomerate has put up two of its assets, toy retailer Detsky Mir and the Bashkirian Power Grid Company, as collateral against a RDIF loan.
Dmitriev said there has been no talks about taking Detsky Mir under its control, as various sources said last week. (Reporting by Katya Golubkova, editing by Louise Heavens; writing by Vladimir Soldatkin; editing by Louise Heavens)
