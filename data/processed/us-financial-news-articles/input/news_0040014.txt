NEW YORK (Reuters) - United Technologies Corp ( UTX.N ) expects to quickly repatriate $2 billion in overseas cash under new U.S. tax laws, Chief Financial Officer Akhil Johri told Reuters on Wednesday.
The maker of Pratt & Whitney aircraft engines, Otis elevators and Carrier air conditioners said it will use the cash to reduce borrowing for its acquisition of avionics and seating supplier Rockwell Collins ( COL.N ), and to pay down debt on that purchase faster than it would have otherwise, Johri said in an interview as the company released fourth-quarter earnings.
