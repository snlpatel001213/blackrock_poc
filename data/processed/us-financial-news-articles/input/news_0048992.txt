The U.S. Treasury Department released a list naming individuals that are closely affiliated with the Russian government.

Among the names included are Alisher Usmanov, the business magnate and part owner of London soccer club Arsenal, and Andrey Kostin, chief executive of the second-biggest lender, VTB.
