Petco Park, home of the San Diego Padres baseball team, will soon have a 336,520-watt solar power system.
The project will be made up of 716 high efficiency, 470 watt SunPower solar modules, the Padres said this week.
The system, from Sullivan Solar Power, will be the biggest in Major League Baseball and produce more than 12 million kilowatt hours of solar power over the next quarter century, the team said. Installation of the panels is underway and is expected to be completed by March.
Erik Greupner, the Padres' chief operating officer, said the team takes pride in continuing to make Petco Park "the most energy efficient and sustainable facility possible."
San Diego has set a target of using 100 percent renewable energy citywide by 2035. Mayor Kevin Faulconer commended the Padres for "turning the best ballpark in the country into one of the most environmentally friendly."
Faulconer said Petco Park will become a model for the rest of Major League Baseball as well as "an example for other San Diego businesses to follow."
