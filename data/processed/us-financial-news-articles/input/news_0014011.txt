The campaign to get the 29-year-old a dog, which his wife Kathryn had agreed to only if he scored a hat-trick this season, went viral after Lichaj scored twice in the second tier club’s 4-2 victory. 
He might have added a third had he been allowed to take one of Forest’s two penalties. 
A social media campaign using the hashtag #GetEricADog took off after the game with fans and team mates bombarding Lichaj’s wife with dog pictures and memes in the hope of getting her to relent. 
The player finally posted a picture on Twitter on Tuesday of himself with a French bulldog and the caption “Wanted to show everyone the newest member of the Lichaj family... Gunner”.
