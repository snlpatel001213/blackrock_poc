Memphis doubled a 10-point halftime lead in the third quarter, then held on against a barrage of Lakers 3-pointers that got the visitors within eight late in the game.
Caldwell-Pope, Kyle Kuzma and Josh Hart bombed in a pair of 3-pointers apiece in the fourth quarter for the Lakers, who totaled 37 points in the period.
Brooks connected on four 3-pointers and hit six of eight shots overall to account for a majority of his 19 points.
Marc Gasol (17 points), James Ennis III (13), Wayne Selden (13), JaMychal Green (11), Jarell Martin (10) and Deyonta Davis (10) also scored in double figures for the balanced Grizzlies, who won for the second time in their last three games.
Memphis shot 51.2 percent from the field and made 10 of its 22 3-point attempts (45.5 percent).
Kuzma finished with 18 points, Hart 16 and Larry Nance Jr. 15 to complement a team-high 11 rebounds for the Lakers, who began a three-game trip with an overtime win at Dallas on Saturday.
The Lakers shot just 39.6 percent in the game.
Memphis took command from the get-go, riding a pair of 3-pointers from Brooks to a 13-4 lead.
Making five of their nine 3-point attempts in the first half, the Grizzlies ran up as much as a 14-point advantage in the second quarter before settling for a 60-50 lead at the break.
