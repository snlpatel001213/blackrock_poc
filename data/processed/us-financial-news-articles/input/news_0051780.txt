Jan 30 (Reuters) - Canada’s main stock index fell to a more than seven-week low on Tuesday as the heavy-weight energy sector was pulled down by weaker oil prices for the second straight day. 
* At 10:14 a.m. ET (1514 GMT), the Toronto Stock Exchange’s S&P/TSX composite index was down 109.83 points, or 0.68 percent, at 15,984.89. 
* The index touched a session low of 15,965.04, its weakest level since Dec. 7 and joining a sell-off in stocks world-wide. 
* The energy group retreated 2.5 percent as U.S. crude prices were down 2.1 percent at $64.21 a barrel amid signs of rising U.S. crude output. 
* Suncor Energy was the biggest drag on the index, down 1.4 percent at C$44.88, while Canadian Natural Resources declined 1.9 percent to C$42.84. 
* Shares of Thomson Reuters bucked the downward trend, up 10.3 percent at C$59.13 after sources said Blackstone Group was in advanced talks to buy a majority stake in a key Thomson Reuters unit. 
* Gold producers also helped temper the Toronto market’s overall weakness, up 0.2 percent, rebounding from the previous sessions’ weakness as gold prices recovered. Barrick Gold rose 0.6 percent to C$17.78. 
* The TSX posted two new 52-week highs and six new lows. Across all Canadian issues there was one new 52-week high and 24 new lows.
