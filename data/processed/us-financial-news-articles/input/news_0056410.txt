DRAPER, Utah, Jan. 30, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Liingo Eyewear is changing the conversation in the outdated eyewear market and getting recognized by industry players, most recently 1-800 Contacts. Liingo's promising start inspired the acquisition by 1-800 Contacts at the end of 2017. This addition will mean an increase in customers for both brands.
1-800 Contacts can now provide consumers with another simple and convenient way to fulfill their vision needs. Liingo is an online eyewear brand that offers a free in-home try on program and free prescription lenses with every pair. John Graham, CEO of 1-800 Contacts, said, "Liingo's unique offering makes it a natural fit for our company. This partnership will only make both brands stronger in our quest to make purchasing eyewear simple and affordable."
"We are excited to take this next step with 1-800 Contacts," said Douglas Harris, CEO of Liingo Eyewear. Harris is no stranger to the eyewear business, with over 16 years in the industry. "We couldn't think of a better business to be a part of than 1-800 Contacts as we drive our mission to enable people to express themselves through eyewear."
With 96 percent of eyewear being sold via brick and mortar stores, Liingo makes it easier than ever to buy online. With their one-of-a-kind in-home try on, Liingo allows customers to try glasses with prescription lenses for free. This program eliminates the risk from the buying process and gives customers ample time to determine which styles work best for them. Liingo offers distinctive, fashionable glasses made of premium, high-quality materials and free prescription lenses rather than costly licensed brands. Glasses range from $79 to $129, making it more affordable for customers to buy multiple pairs to match their every mood and occasion.
