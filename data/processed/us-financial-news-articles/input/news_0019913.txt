LIMA, Jan 11 (Reuters) - Peruâ€™s central bank lowered the benchmark interest rate to 3 percent as widely expected on Thursday, citing weak economic growth and slowing inflation.
Eight out of nine analysts polled by Reuters had forecast the 25-basis-point reduction to the key rate, with one forecasting a hold at 3.25 percent. (Reporting By Mitra Taj; Editing by Chris Reese)
