ISTANBUL, Jan 12 (Reuters) - Turkish Deputy Prime Minister Mehmet Simsek said Halkbank itself will pay any fine imposed by the United States after a U.S. jury convicted a Halkbank executive of helping Iran evade U.S. sanctions, Hurriyet newspaper reported on Friday.
“If Halkbank receives a fine, Halkbank will pay this. We will not borrow for Halkbank,” Simsek, who is responsible for the Turkish Treasury, was cited as saying by Hurriyet. (Reporting by Orhan Coskun; Writing by Daren Butler; Editing by David Dolan)
