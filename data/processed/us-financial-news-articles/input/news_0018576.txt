The second largest U.S. automaker said it was able to confirm in late December that a July 2017 crash death in West Virginia in a 2006 Ford Ranger was caused by a defective Takata inflator. It previously reported a similar death in January 2016. 
Ford said both Takata deaths occurred with inflators built on the same day. At least 21 deaths worldwide are believed linked to the Takata ( TKTDQ.PK ) inflators that can rupture and send deadly metal fragments that has led to the largest automotive recall in history. All of the other deaths have occurred in Honda Motor Co ( 7267.T ) vehicles. Reporting by David Shepardson Editing by Chizu Nomiyama
