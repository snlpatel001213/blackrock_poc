"Both Jean-Michel and Elan are two of our most talented leaders at Ruder Finn," says Kathy Bloomgarden, Ruder Finn CEO. "With their new roles, they will be able to take their leadership talent, business growth success and partnership development to benefit the broader agency across global offices."
Dumont, who was listed in the PRWeek Global Power Book 2017 as one of the most influential PR professionals in the world, received the Sabre Individual Achievement Award 2016 and Consultancy Professional of the Year at Public Affairs Asia Gold Standard Awards 2015, has been overseeing Ruder Finn Asia operations since 2008.

Prior to that he was in charge of the agency's China operations for seven years, where he helped set the foundations to Ruder Finn's leadership. He will bring this focus on growth to the broader Ruder Finn global network, with an initial emphasis on building Ruder Finn's presence in the EMEA region.
Shou, who was named PR Agency Head of the Year by PRWeek Awards Asia in 2016, has grown the Ruder Finn China region to one of the most profitable among the agency. She has followed the growth of the Chinese market by continuing to build on Ruder Finn's strength in luxury and branding, as well as expertise in integrated marketing communications (IMC).
