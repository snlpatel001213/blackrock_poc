FOURTH QUARTER INCOME STATEMENT REVIEW
Net income for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, was $25.9 million, a decrease of $22.1 million, or 46.0%, compared to net income of $48.0 million for the same quarter a year ago. Fourth quarter results included $22.3 million of additional tax expense related to the revaluation of the Company's deferred tax assets and a $2.6 million pretax write-down of low income housing investments, both, as a result of the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. These two items had the effect of reducing diluted EPS by $.29 per diluted share for the quarter and for the year. Diluted earnings per share for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, was $0.32 compared to $0.60 for the same quarter a year ago.
Return on average stockholders' equity was 5.18% and return on average assets was 0.66% for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, compared to a return on average stockholders' equity of 10.52% and a return on average assets of 1.37% for the same quarter a year ago.
Net interest income before provision for credit losses
Net interest income before provision for credit losses increased $23.4 million, or 21.3%, to $133.3 million during the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $109.9 million during the same quarter a year ago. The increase was due primarily to an increase in interest income from organic loan growth and loans from the acquisition of FENB and a decrease in interest expense from securities sold under agreements to repurchase.
The net interest margin was 3.65% for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to 3.36% for the fourth quarter of 2016 and 3.75% for the third quarter of 2017. The decrease from the third quarter of 2017 was primarily the result of interest recoveries and prepayment penalties of $2.5 million recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $5.6 million in the third quarter.
For the fourth quarter of 2017, the yield on average interest-earning assets was 4.27%, the cost of funds on average interest-bearing liabilities was 0.84%, and the cost of interest-bearing deposits was 0.73%. In comparison, for the fourth quarter of 2016, the yield on average interest-earning assets was 4.00%, the cost of funds on average interest-bearing liabilities was 0.86%, and the cost of average interest-bearing deposits was 0.69%. The increase in the yield on average interest earning assets was a result of higher interest rates. The net interest spread, defined as the difference between the yield on average interest-earning assets and the cost of funds on average interest-bearing liabilities, was 3.43% for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, compared to 3.14% for the same quarter a year ago.
Provision/(reversal) for credit losses
There was no provision for credit losses recorded for the fourth quarter of 2017 or 2016. The provision/(reversal) for credit losses was based on a review of the appropriateness of the allowance for loan losses at December 31, 2017. The following table summarizes the charge-offs and recoveries for the periods indicated:

Non-interest income
Non-interest income, which includes revenues from depository service fees, letters of credit commissions, securities gains (losses), wire transfer fees, and other sources of fee income, was $10.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, an increase of $2.2 million, or 28.3%, compared to $8.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2016, primarily due to increases of $2.3 million in other operating income relating to venture capital investments, wealth management commissions and other fees.
Non-interest expense
Non-interest expense increased $12.9 million, or 24.1%, to $66.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $53.5 million in the same quarter a year ago. The increase in non-interest expense in the fourth quarter of 2017 was primarily due to a $5.8 million increase in amortization of investments in low income housing and alternative energy partnerships expenses, a $3.5 million increase in salaries and employee benefits expense, a $1.2 million increase in professional services expense, and offset by a $2.6 million decrease in other real estate owned expense when compared to the same quarter a year ago. The efficiency ratio was 46.3% in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to 45.4% for the same quarter a year ago.
Income taxes
The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2017 was 66.4% compared to 25.4% for the fourth quarter of 2016. On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, was enacted into law and as a result, during the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company recorded $22.3 million of additional income tax expense related to the revaluation of the Company's deferred tax assets. These adjustments are management's best estimate based on the information available as of this earnings release and are subject to change as final tax calculations are completed in conjunction with the filing of the Form 10-K.
