That's because Trump scored a perfect 30/30 on a test called the Montreal Cognitive Assessment, Jackson told the White House press corps on Tuesday. 
Developed in 1996, the MoCA uses 30 questions to test for mild cognitive impairment in adults. It takes about 10 minutes to do, and requires one administrator per test taker. The questions range from identifying certain kinds of animals, to repeating back specific sets of words.
