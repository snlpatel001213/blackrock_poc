South Africa: Zuma setting up commission to look into allegations of state corruption January 10th, 2018 Africa 
South African President Jacob Zuma said on Tuesday he will set up a commission of inquiry into allegations of influence-peddling, after a 2016 anti-graft report called for a judge to investigate any corruption in his government. 
Zuma was ordered to establish the inquiry within 30 days of a High Court ruling last month, which upheld the recommendations of South Africa’s corruption-fighting Public Protector. 
“I am concerned that this matter has occupied the public mind for some time now and deserves urgent attention,” Zuma said in a statement.
