KABUL (Reuters) - A car bomb in an ambulance wounded at least 18 people at a police checkpoint in the Afghan capital on Saturday in an area near foreign embassies and government buildings, a week after a deadly attack on the Intercontinental Hotel. 
Mirwais Yasini, a member of parliament who was nearby when the explosion occurred, said the ambulance approached the checkpoint, close to an office of the High Peace Council and a number of foreign embassies, and blew up. 
He said a number of people were lying on the ground. 
Health ministry spokesman Wahid Majroh said 18 wounded had been brought into city hospitals. There was no word on any fatalities. 
A plume of grey smoke rose from the blast area in the city center and buildings hundreds of meters away were shaken by the force of the explosion. 
There was no immediate claim of responsibility but the blast came after heightened security alerts following the Intercontinental Hotel attack. That attack, which killed more than 20 people, was claimed by the Taliban. Reporting by Hamid Shalizi; Editing by Nick Macfie
