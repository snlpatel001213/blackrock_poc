U.S. President Donald Trump's lawyer is threatening legal action against former White House Chief Strategist Steve Bannon for making "disparaging" and "outright defamatory" statements in a new book.
Those statements were made to Michael Wolff, the author of a book that chronicles Trump's first year in office. The president's attorney Charles Harder sent a letter to Bannon on Wednesday, demanding him to "cease and desist" any more of such claims.

Bannon was fired from the Trump administration in August last year as part of a broader purge of some of the most hardline nationalist voices in the West Wing. He has made some of the harshest criticisms about the president, such as calling the firing of former FBI Director James Comey the "biggest mistake in modern political history."
On Thursday, Harder sent a cease and desist letter to Wolff and his publisher, Henry Holt & Co., and demanded an apology for the content of the book.
