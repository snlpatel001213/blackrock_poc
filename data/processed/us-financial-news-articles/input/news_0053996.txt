SAN DIEGO, Jan. 31, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Medical Marijuana, Inc. (OTC: MJNA), the first-ever publicly traded cannabis company in the United States, today announced Ian Quinn as the CEO of subsidiary Phyto Animal Health .
Phyto Animal Health offers a line of cannabidiol (CBD) hemp oil supplements and hemp products targeted to cats, dogs and horses. CBD hemp oil has been researched by top veterinarians for cardiovascular, orthopedic and mental health in animals.
Quinn has nearly a decade of experience in the animal health industry. Prior to starting Phyto Animal Health, he was a senior executive for a nationally recognized pet medical device company and helped provide direct support to veterinarians, veterinary colleges and zoos utilizing the company's products and services. For over a decade, Quinn has volunteered as the Director of U.S. Rape Prevention at Just Yell Fire, a non-profit organization aimed to empower teens to fight back against rape, assault and abduction.
Quinn became interested in creating CBD products when he saw first-hand the impact that CBD and cannabis products made with veterans while teaching anger management at local Veteran Affairs housing programs. He collaborated with veterinarians to help his pit bull Dante in the same way and now, since seeing how Dante has benefited greatly from CBD, he hopes to help people across the world bring those same benefits to their pets.
"Our company has almost a decade of experience in providing the therapeutic benefits of CBD to humans and now Mr. Quinn has made it possible for us to offer the same to animals," said Medical Marijuana, Inc. CEO Dr. Stuart Titus. "His vast experience paired with his caring, entrepreneurial spirit makes him a perfect leader in our family of companies."
In his new role as CEO, Quinn will oversee all operations, marketing efforts and product development for Phyto Animal Health.
