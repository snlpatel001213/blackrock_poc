FRANKFURT, Jan 8 (Reuters) - A Berlin court said airline Niki was not under German jurisdiction, backing a legal challenge to the carrier’s insolvency filing and calling into question a deal for Britain’s IAG to buy the Air Berlin unit.
The regional court for Berlin said on Monday it was reversing a lower court’s Dec. 13 decision to allow insolvency proceedings because Austria, not Germany, was responsible for Niki’s insolvency proceedings. (Reporting by Maria Sheahan; Editing by Tom Sims)
