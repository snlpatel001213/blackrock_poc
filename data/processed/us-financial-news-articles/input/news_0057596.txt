Online lender Social Finance Inc. is laying off dozens of employees in its mortgage division, an area the company previously highlighted for its growth prospects, according to people familiar with the matter. 
The San Francisco-based financial-technology company told staffers on Tuesday it is cutting around 65 jobs, roughly 5% of its 1,300-person workforce, the people said. The layoffs are centered in SoFi’s mortgage-operations centers in Healdsburg, Calif., and Cottonwood Heights, Utah. 
A SoFi spokesman said the company “made some changes to staffing to ensure we have the right people in the right roles and locations to power our growth.” He added that SoFi is currently looking to fill more than 175 open jobs. 
The layoffs come a week after SoFi announced that it hired Twitter executive Anthony Noto to be its next CEO, effective March 1. SoFi had been left without a permanent chief executive since Mike Cagney resigned in September.
