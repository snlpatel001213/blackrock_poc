If Bitcoin's too crazy a ride for you, here are 18 stocks that analysts say could enjoy their own personal bull runs in 2018.
The "18 stocks for '18" list includes oil and natural gas drillers and drug makers. It also spotlights an internet travel company and high-tech firms that make the digital computing world go.
This lineup of potential stars (shown below) is based on a simple methodology: They're the companies in the Standard & Poor's 500 with the biggest potential to rise when you compare their closing share price on Dec. 15 to the higher projected price targets of Wall Street analysts, using data from S&P Global Market Intelligence.
Aside from strong-performing tech names, many of these stocks are considered good deals or "value plays," because their prices were beaten down in 2017 despite a nearly 20% gain for the broader market.
Energy companies, which fell more than 3% in 2017 and were among the worst stock market performers, dominate the list.

The industry — which includes companies that drill for oil as well as ones that provide services and storage facilities to energy customers — is seen bouncing back in 2018. Analysts expect them to benefit from stronger prices, bigger earnings gains following government tax cuts and a global economy that is growing virtually everywhere.
Tech companies, which enjoyed the biggest gains of all industry groups in 2017, are expected to fare well again. A strong economy and cash windfalls from tax cuts could fuel a rebound in corporate spending on equipment and a continued push into emerging technologies like the cloud, artificial intelligence and robotics.
