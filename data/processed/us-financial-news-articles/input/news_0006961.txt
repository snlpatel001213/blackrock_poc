The Dunkin’ Donuts menu is slimming down. 
As of Monday, stores in New York and New England will see a smaller menu, with “ slow moving ” items such as smoothies, afternoon sandwiches, and some breakfast items eliminated. Franchises throughout the rest of the country will see the changes by March.

The menu items set for elimination were already optional for individual franchises, and 90% of the menu will remain unchanged. The full list of items on the chopping block include smoothies; turkey, cheddar and bacon, ham and cheddar, tuna and chicken salad afternoon sandwiches; the Big N’ Toasted and Angus steak and egg breakfast sandwiches; flatbread items; some muffins and bagel and cream cheese combinations that were optional for restaurants; and peach, caramel and mocha flavor coffee shots.
