"The vibrant economy in our markets was the foundation for Pinnacle Bank's outstanding year in 2017. Our loans and deposits grew 13% and 16%, respectively over 2016 reflecting the success of our relationship banking approach in attracting and retaining clients. These client relationships helped drive our net interest income to a new high. Our experienced relationship managers and specialized lenders capitalized on the economy to originate a record amount of SBA 7(a) loans in 2017 that made us a top SBA lender in California and fueled the large increase in gains on the sale of SBA 7(a) loan guarantees. Our credit quality remained solid as loans grew and competition increased during the year," stated Jeffrey Payne, President and CEO. "We appreciate the continued efforts and contributions of our outstanding bankers, our committed directors and advisors and our many loyal clients."
