SANDHURST, England (Reuters) - French President Emmanuel Macron on Thursday hailed the strength of Franco-British ties despite Brexit, but warned that he would not allow Britain’s financial industry to have privileged access to the EU single market.

“Now the choice in on the British side. There can not be a differentiated access to the single market of which financial services are part,” he said.
