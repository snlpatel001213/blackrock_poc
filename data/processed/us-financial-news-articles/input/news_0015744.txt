VIENNA (Reuters) - Airline Niki filed for insolvency in Austria on Thursday, in a move to safeguard its agreed sale to British Airways owner IAG ( ICAG.L ) after a German court ruling put a question mark over the deal, a spokesman for Niki’s insolvency administrator said.

Niki filed for insolvency in Berlin last month after Germany’s Lufthansa ( LHAG.DE ) scrapped plans to buy the Austrian arm of insolvent Air Berlin, but a German regional court said earlier this week that Niki was not under German jurisdiction. 
“Niki filed for insolvency in Austria today,” a spokesman for administrator Lucas Floether said. Reporting by Kirsti Knolle; Editing by Shadia Nasralla
