Shareholders of record of the Company's common and preferred stock will receive an Internal Revenue Service Form 1099-DIV from Wells Fargo Shareowner Services, the Company's 2017 dividend paying agent. The form will report the dividends paid and the amounts designated as total ordinary dividends, qualified dividends, total capital gains, unrecaptured section 1250 gains, and nontaxable dividends. If shares were held in "street name" during 2017, the IRS form will be provided by a bank, brokerage firm, or nominee. Because the Company's tax return has not yet been filed for the year ended December 31, 2017, the dividend income tax allocations presented herein have been calculated using the best available information to date.
The tax treatment of these dividends by state and local authorities varies and may not be the same as the IRS's treatment. Because federal and state tax laws affect individuals differently, the Company cannot advise shareholders on how dividends should be reported on their tax returns. The Company encourages shareholders to consult with their own tax advisors with respect to the federal, state and local income tax consequences of these dividends.
