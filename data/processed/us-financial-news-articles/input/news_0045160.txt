BETHESDA, Md., Jan. 24, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- WealthEngine, under the new leadership of Dennis Ainge, has created an executive advisory board. The purpose of the advisory board is to provide strategic guidance to the business as it continues to lead the nonprofit market and accelerate its expansion into commercial markets, bringing world-class wealth intelligence to fundraising, sales, and marketing professionals. The board will bring in data industry experts with diverse backgrounds to offer objective, creative, and strategic points of view to the WealthEngine leadership team.
WealthEngine has selected Mike Sullivan as the first member of the advisory board. Sullivan is a seasoned financial and operating executive with nearly 30 years of experience in the data and software industries.
Dennis Ainge, interim CEO, stated, "We are thrilled to have Mike join us as a strategic advisor to the company. His expertise will be crucial to our continued push into the financial services, luxury, real estate, travel, and other industry market segments."
Sullivan has served as a CFO for various technology companies since 1999 including E-centives, Inc., Viaken Systems, NexTone Communications Corp., TARGUS Information Corporation, and Lotame Solutions, Inc. His financial expertise in the data industry will provide WealthEngine with invaluable insight into growth strategies and will help accelerate WealthEngine's presence, expansion and execution in the commercial market.
Sullivan stated, "It's great to be teamed up with Dennis again. Together, and with other members of TARGUSinfo, we built one of the most successful marketing and analytics companies in the U.S. I see similar potential in WealthEngine – unique data assets and niche data solutions to those companies looking to target individuals with the capacity to give or spend more. I'm confident we'll be able to help WealthEngine grow in both the nonprofit and commercial markets and I'm eager to jump in."
