The White House said the conversation was intended “to underscore” U.S., South Korean and international resolve to achieve the complete denuclearisation of North Korea. 
“The Presidents also agreed that the widespread demonstrations in Iran were a sign of the Iranian regime’s failure to serve its people’s needs by instead diverting the nation’s wealth to fund terrorism and militancy abroad,” the White House said in a statement.
