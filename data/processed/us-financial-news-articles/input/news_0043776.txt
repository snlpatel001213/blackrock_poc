LONDON, Jan 24 (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Theresa May said on Wednesday her government will cut the stakes on fixed odds betting terminals but had had to wait for the conclusion of a consulation.
She told parliament a decision on the stakes would be made “in due course” after the consultation ended earlier this week. (Reporting by William James, writing by Elizabeth Piper. Editing by Andrew MacAskill)
