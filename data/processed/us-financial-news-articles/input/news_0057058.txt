(Reuters) - Music streaming service Spotify has been testing an app to rival Pandora Media Inc’s streaming stations, TechCrunch reported on Tuesday. 
The new app, called “Stations by Spotify”, was visible on the Google Play Store but Reuters could not immediately verify in which markets the app is available. 
The app will allow users to stream music personalized to their tastes in songs, artists and genres, according to its description. Pandora offers a similar service. 
"Stations by Spotify", being piloted in Australia, will not require users to be paying Spotify members and will be supported by advertising, according to the TechCrunch report. tcrn.ch/2DXnNgf
