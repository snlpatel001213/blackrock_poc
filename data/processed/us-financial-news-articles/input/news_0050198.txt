 42 PM / in 26 minutes Spanish court says Puigdemont must attend parliament in person Reuters Staff 1 Min Read 
MADRID (Reuters) - Spain’s Constitutional Court said on Saturday the former leader of Catalonia, Carles Puigdemont, could only attend a swearing-in session to become regional leader if he was physically present in the parliament and had a judge’s permission to attend. 
Puigdemont, living in Brussels since October, is wanted in Spain on charges of sedition and rebellion for spearheading an independence movement. He is due to face a vote of confidence as the region’s only presidential candidate on Jan. 30. Reporting by Sonya Dowset, editing by Louise Heavens
