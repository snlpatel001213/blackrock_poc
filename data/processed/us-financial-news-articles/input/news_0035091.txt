LONDON (Reuters) - Platinum miner Lonmin reported a 65 percent drop in 2017 profit on Monday citing higher costs and subdued commodity prices but reiterated its 2018 targets. 
The London and Johannesburg-listed miner said earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) fell to $40 million (28.8 million pounds) for the year to ended Sept. 30 from $115 million a year earlier. 
Lonmin delayed its results last year pending the outcome of a business review. Reporting by Zandi Shabalala; editing by Jason Neely
