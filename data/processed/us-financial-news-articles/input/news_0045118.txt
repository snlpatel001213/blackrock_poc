PARIS (Reuters) - French gas and power group Engie ( ENGIE.PA ) said in a statement it had agreed to acquire a majority stake in French hydrogen-based power storage firm Electro Power Systems (EPS) ( EPS.PA ).
Engie gave no financial details but said it had bought just over 50 percent of the capital of EPS, which has a market capitalization of 96 million euros.
EPS, listed on Euronext, sells hydrogen-based systems for energy storage with capacities up to hundreds of megawatthours.
Engie CEO Isabelle Kocher has made hydrogen one of the core technologies in a planned switch to fully renewable gas by 2050.
