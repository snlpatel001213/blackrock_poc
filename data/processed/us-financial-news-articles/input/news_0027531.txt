(Reuters) - A Washington D.C. subway train derailed early Monday, but none of the 60 passengers aboard were injured, the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority said.
Around 6:40 a.m. (1140 GMT), a train derailed outside Farragut North Station in downtown Washington. The agency said in a posting on Twitter that “emergency personnel on scene. Shuttle buses are running in place of trains, both directions.”
