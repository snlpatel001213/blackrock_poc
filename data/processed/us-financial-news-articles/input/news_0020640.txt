GoPro Inc. : "No, I don't think it'll be bought. It's a billion-dollar company that seems to have not a lot going for it. If it's going to be bought out, it's probably going to be [for] less than a billion."
Helmerich & Payne : "Oh, I like Helmerich & Payne. Everyone laughed when they upped the dividend except for them. They are well-run."
Service Corp. Intl vs. Carriage Services : "Service is the one that everyone knows and I think is a good company. The other one, Carriage, is not that well-known. I'd say stick with Service."
STMicroelectronics : "I like that stock very much. Now, let's remember, that group has gotten hot again and we're starting to circle back. We want to be careful because ASML , [which] reports later this week, could impact that stock."
Energous Corp. : "No, man. This thing is way too speculative for me. Sell, sell, sell. Maybe something works out, but I'll just hurt people if I say, 'Good,' and it goes up, great. But I could hurt people. I'm not going to hurt people."
Universal Display : "We're having pullbacks in these high-multiple, high-growth stocks, so now you have to wait for the pullback in OLED. It's had a big move. We can wait for a pullback. We do not need to just plunge in. There's nothing today that is moving it."
The Carlyle Group : "I think Carlyle's good. I actually like Blackstone more."
