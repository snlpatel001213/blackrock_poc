Total noninterest expense declined compared to both the third quarter of 2017 and the fourth quarter of 2016. Earnings benefitted from a positive pre-tax mortgage servicing rights ("MSR") valuation adjustment of $2.4 million. Net operating income – excluding MSR – of $36.8 million, or $0.41 per diluted share. Recorded additional income tax expense of $0.6 million, or $0.01 per share, to reflect the net impact of certain strategic tax planning decisions as well as the revaluation of the net deferred tax asset resulting from corporate tax law changes enacted by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.
The Company reported net income of $37.5 million, or $0.41 per diluted share, of 2017 compared with net income of $37.7 million, or $0.40 per diluted share, of 2016 and net income of $39.5 million, or $0.43 per diluted share, for the third quarter of 2017. The Company reported net operating income – excluding MSR – of $36.8 million, or $0.41 per diluted share, of 2017 compared to $30.7 million, or $0.33 per diluted share, of 2016 and $39.6 million, or $0.43 per diluted share, for the third quarter of 2017.
Additionally, the company reported net income of $153.0 million, or $1.67 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $132.7 million, or $1.41 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2016.

Net operating income – excluding MSR – is a non-GAAP financial measure used by management to assess the core operating performance of the Company. This measure excludes items such as securities gains and losses, MSR valuation adjustments, restructuring charges, merger-related expenses, industry-related legal settlements, and other one-time charges.
At its regular quarterly meeting today, the Board of Directors of the Company declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.14 per share of common stock. The dividend is payable April 2, 2018 to shareholders of record at the close of business on March 15, 2018.
"We are pleased to report a successful completion to 2017," remarked Dan Rollins, BancorpSouth Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "A lot of hard work and progress by our teammates culminated in the closings of our pending transactions with Ouachita Bancshares Corp. and Central Community Corporation, which were effective January 15, 2018. We could not have reached this point without the commitment and patience demonstrated by the shareholders, management teams, and employees of these two companies. We are excited to have them as a part of our team. Furthermore, we are pleased to be able to continue executing our strategic plan, of which these two organizations are an integral part."
"As we look specifically at fourth quarter results, we saw positive progress in a number of areas despite seasonally lower revenues associated with several of our noninterest products. Total operating expense declined compared to both the third quarter of 2017 and the fourth quarter of 2016. Additionally, we saw continued yield pickup in our loan and securities portfolios, combined with relatively stable deposit costs. The positive impact of these items on our margin was offset by the decision to leverage the balance sheet in order to prefund the securities portfolio restructuring in anticipation of the merger closings."
"Finally, we expect that the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 will provide a tremendous benefit to our company and our shareholders. Our board of directors and management team recognize that our employees, along with their customer relationships, are the most valuable asset of our company. I'm proud the first investment that we made as a result of this legislation was in our teammates, through salary increases and one-time bonuses. This legislation also resulted in the revaluation of our net deferred tax asset. We made certain strategic tax planning decisions, which allowed us to reduce the net impact of the revaluation to $0.6 million."

TRANSACTIONS
The Reorganization
Effective October 31, 2017, the previously announced merger of BancorpSouth, Inc. with and into BancorpSouth Bank was closed, with BancorpSouth Bank continuing as the surviving entity (the "Reorganization"). This transaction resulted in the elimination of the holding company structure. The reorganization is expected to improve efficiency through the elimination of redundant corporate infrastructure and duplicative regulatory oversight. See our current report on Form 8-K that was filed with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the "FDIC") on November 1, 2017 and that is incorporated herein by reference.

Summary
Rollins concluded, "Our annual results for 2017 reflect continued improvement in many of our operating metrics. Although our loan and deposit growth for the year was not as high as we would have liked, we saw significant improvement in other areas including record net income of $153.0 million, or $1.67 per diluted share. Our total operating expense for 2017 actually declined $7.4 million compared to 2016, which contributed to our operating efficiency ratio - excluding MSR - declining from 69.8 percent to 67.8 percent. This improvement, combined with the expansion in our net interest margin and other factors, contributed to 11 percent growth in our operating earnings per share. Finally, we were able to return capital to our shareholders, repurchasing approximately 3.7 million shares at a weighted average price of $29.94. As we look to 2018, I'm confident our company is positioned to continue to improve our operating performance and enhance the returns delivered to our shareholders."

Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures and Other Non-GAAP Ratio Definitions
(Dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)
(Unaudited)
Management evaluates the Company's capital position and operating performance by utilizing certain financial measures not calculated in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), including net operating income, net operating income-excluding MSR, total operating expense, tangible shareholders' equity to tangible assets, return on tangible equity, operating return on tangible equity-excluding MSR, operating return on average assets-excluding MSR, operating return on average shareholders' equity-excluding MSR, tangible book value per share, operating earnings per share, operating earnings per share-excluding MSR, efficiency ratio (tax equivalent) and operating efficiency ratio-excluding MSR (tax equivalent). The Company has included these non-GAAP financial measures in this news release for the applicable periods presented. Management believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures (i) provides important supplemental information that contributes to a proper understanding of the Company's capital position and operating performance, (ii) enables a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting the Company's business and (iii) allows investors to evaluate the Company's performance in a manner similar to management, the financial services industry, bank stock analysts and bank regulators. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are presented in the tables below. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as substitutes for GAAP financial measures, and the Company strongly encourages investors to review the GAAP financial measures included in this news release and not to place undue reliance upon any single financial measure. In addition, because non-GAAP financial measures are not standardized, it may not be possible to compare the non-GAAP financial measures presented in this news release with other companies' non-GAAP financial measures having the same or similar names.

Efficiency Ratio (tax equivalent) and Operating Efficiency Ratio-excluding MSR (tax equivalent) Definitions
The efficiency ratio (tax equivalent) and the operating efficiency ratio-excluding MSR (tax equivalent) are supplemental financial measures utilized in management's internal evaluation of the Company's use of resources and are not defined under GAAP. The efficiency ratio (tax equivalent) is calculated by dividing total noninterest expense by total revenue, which includes net interest income plus noninterest income plus the tax equivalent adjustment. The operating efficiency ratio-excluding MSR (tax equivalent) excludes expense items otherwise disclosed as non-operating from total noninterest expense. In addition, the MSR valuation adjustment as well as securities gains and losses are excluded from total revenue.
