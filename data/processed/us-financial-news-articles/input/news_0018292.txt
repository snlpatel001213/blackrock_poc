HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong police arrested a South Korean man on suspicion of murder on Sunday after his wife and seven-year-old son were found dead in a room at the five star Ritz-Carlton hotel. 
Officers found the bodies after being called to the luxury hotel at 8:30 am to investigate a reported assault, police told Reuters. The man appeared drunk and injured when he was arrested, police said, and he was sent to hospital. 
Ritz Carlton did not immediately respond to requests for comments by phone and by email, and the South Korean consulate could not be reached as it was outside office hours. 
No further details are immediately available. 
The Ritz-Carlton is located on the top 15 floors of Hong Kongâ€™s tallest building, the International Commerce Centre, and overlooks the Victoria Harbour. Reporting by Sijia Jiang; Editing by Simon Cameron-Moore
