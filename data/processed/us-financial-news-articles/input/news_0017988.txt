Commenting on Volt’s performance, Michael Dean, President and CEO, said, “Volt’s full year results showed continued evidence of improvement in several key financial and operational metrics. I am pleased our focus on higher margin business resulted in expanding our gross margins by 52 basis points year-over-year to 15.7%. In addition, our ongoing focus on achieving operational efficiencies and cost containment has continued to deliver lower selling, administrative and other operating costs.”
Mr. Dean continued, “The turnaround strategy that we have executed over the past two years has successfully helped us address many of Volt’s operational challenges and we have a strong foundation from which we continue to build. During this time, we have dramatically simplified our operating structure through the sale of non-core assets, which has strengthened our balance sheet and liquidity position. At the same time, we have also been successful in streamlining our cost structure and gross margins continue to improve. While much has been accomplished, we now must ensure our efforts and investments convert to topline growth, as well as continue to explore a broad range of opportunities to enhance shareholder value. I look forward to overcoming Volt’s remaining challenges and emerging as a stronger company.”
Fiscal 2017 Fourth Quarter Results

The decline was primarily driven by lower demand from customers in both professional and commercial job families, as well as customers experiencing decreased demand for their services and changes in their staffing models.
International Staffing revenue, which includes the Company’s contingent staffing, direct placement and managed service programs businesses in Europe and Asia, was $30.2 million, a $1.5 million, or 4.9% decrease compared to $31.7 million from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, primarily as a result of softening economic demand in the United Kingdom.
Technology Outsourcing Services and Solutions revenue, which provides quality assurance, business intelligence and analytics and customer service support for companies in a variety of industries, was $26.4 million, down $4.1 million, or 13.7%, compared to $30.5 million in the prior year period, primarily due to lower volume in quality assurance testing services, which was sold at the end of the quarter. While the overall segment was down year-over-year, the remaining call center business experienced sequential revenue growth in the fourth quarter as well as year-over-year revenue growth in fiscal 2017.
Corporate and Other revenue, which now primarily consists of the Company’s North American managed service business, was $9.7 million, down $17.9 million, or 65.0%, compared to $27.6 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. The year-over-year revenue decline was primarily driven by the impact from the sale of Maintech, which occurred early in the second quarter of 2017. On a same-store basis, excluding businesses sold or exited of $17.6 million, Corporate and Other revenue decreased $0.3 million, or 3.6%, year-over-year.
Selling, administrative and other operating costs in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 decreased $0.5 million, or 1.0%, to $50.1 million from $50.6 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. This decrease was primarily due to ongoing cost reductions throughout the business as well as the sale of Maintech. These decreases were partially offset by higher depreciation and software license expenses related to completion of the first phase of the upgrade of the Company’s back-office financial suite and information technology tools.
Income from continuing operations of $39.8 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 increased $37.0 million from $2.8 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016.
