CAIRO—Egyptian authorities on Tuesday arrested a former military chief who planned to run for president, his campaign said, potentially eliminating one of the strongest remaining challengers to state-backed President Abdel Fattah Al Sisi in March elections.
In a statement on national television, the military leadership accused Mr. Anan, who continues to serve as a lieutenant general reserve officer, with what it called “violations and crimes,” including forging documents and declaring his candidacy without military authorization.
