DALLAS, Jan. 19, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Permian Basin Royalty Trust (NYSE: PBT) ("Permian") today declared a cash distribution to the holders of its units of beneficial interest of $0.059614 per unit, payable on February 14, 2018, to unit holders of record on January 31, 2018.
This month's distribution increased from the previous month due to an increase in oil and gas pricing, and was offset by the number of days of production for the month of November. The Texas Royalty Properties had a slight decrease in oil and gas production offset by an increase in the pricing of both oil and gas production.
Capital expenditures on the Waddell Ranch are lower this month than previous months, with it being mostly facility projects for the remainder of the year.
WADDELL RANCH
Production for the underlying properties at the Waddell Ranch was 55,470 barrels of oil and 313,618 Mcf of gas. The production for the Trust's allocated portion of the Waddell Ranch was 24,872 barrels of oil and 141,604 Mcf of gas. The average price for oil was $53.55 per bbl and for gas was $3.80 per Mcf. This would primarily reflect production and pricing for the month of November for oil and the month of October for gas. These allocated volumes were significantly impacted by the pricing of both oil and gas.
This production and pricing for the Underlying Properties resulted in revenues for the Waddell Ranch Properties of $4,163,678. Deducted from these would be the Lease Operating Expense (LOE) of $1,357,615, taxes of $269,512, and Capital Expenditures (CAPEX) of $146,820 totaling $1,773,947 resulting in a Net Profit of $2,389,731 for the month of December. With the Trust's Net Profit Interest (NPI) of 75% of the underlying properties, this would result in a net contribution by the Waddell Ranch Properties of $1,792,298 to this month's distribution.
