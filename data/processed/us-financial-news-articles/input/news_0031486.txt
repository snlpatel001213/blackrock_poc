Loans
Total loans at December 31, 2017 were $19.0 billion, up approximately $218 million, or 1%, linked-quarter. Loans to energy-related companies decreased $78 million during the fourth quarter. Net loan growth during the quarter continues to be diversified across the footprint and also in areas identified as part of the company’s revenue-generating initiatives.
Average loans totaled $18.8 billion for the fourth quarter of 2017, up $248 million, or 1%, linked-quarter.
Energy
At December 31, 2017, loans to the energy industry totaled $1.1 billion, or 5.6% of total loans. As noted earlier, the energy portfolio was down $78 million, or 7%, linked-quarter, and is comprised of credits to both the exploration and production (E&P) sector and the support and services sectors. Payoffs and paydowns of approximately $133 million and charge-offs of approximately $8 million were partially offset by approximately $63 million in fundings.
The impact and severity of future risk rating migration, as well as any associated provisions or net charge-offs, will depend on overall oil prices and the duration of the energy cycle that began in November 2014. Recent higher oil prices are helpful in the recovery of credits impacted by the energy cycle, however the key to resolution of many of those credits, especially in support services, is stabilization of prices over the longer term.
Management continues to estimate that net charge-offs from energy-related credits could approximate up to $95 million over the duration of the cycle, of which approximately $76 million has been taken to-date. While we expect additional charge-offs in the portfolio, we continue to believe the impact of the energy cycle on our loan portfolio will be manageable, our reserve is adequate and our capital will remain solid.
Deposits
Total deposits at December 31, 2017 were $22.3 billion, up $719 million, or 3%, from September 30, 2017. The increase is mainly related to annual year-end seasonality of public fund deposits.
