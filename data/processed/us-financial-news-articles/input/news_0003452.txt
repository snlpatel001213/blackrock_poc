Jan 4 (Reuters) - Australian shares are expected to open higher on Thursday, inspired by continued strength on Wall Street where major indexes climbed to record levels, while upbeat oil prices are also likely to support energy stocks.

The local share price index futures rose 0.5 percent or 32 points to 6,063, a 7.4-point discount to the underlying S&P/ASX 200 index close. The benchmark rose 0.2 percent on Wednesday.
