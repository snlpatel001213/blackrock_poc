BAGHDAD, Jan 29 (Reuters) - The Iraqi parliament voted on Monday to lift sanctions imposed on banks in the Kurdistan region, two main Iraqi TV channels reported.
During a session in Baghdad, lawmakers adopted a decision approving that sanctions be lifted after they “fulfilled their purpose” by enforcing federal controls on the Kurdish banking industry, said a copy of the measure published by Baghdad-based al-Sumariya TV.
