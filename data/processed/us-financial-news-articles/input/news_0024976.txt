RIYADH (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia’s King Salman ordered a deposit of $2 billion (£1.4 billion) into Yemen’s central bank on Wednesday to shore up the weak Yemeni currency, the Saudi government’s media office said. 
The move comes a day after the Yemeni prime minister issued a public plea for funds to prop up the rial and help stave off hunger in the war-torn country. Reporting by Sarah Dadouch; Writing by Noah Browning; Editing by Andrew Torchia
