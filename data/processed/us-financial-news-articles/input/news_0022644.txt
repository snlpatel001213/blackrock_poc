After an extended spell on the sidelines with an elbow injury, Djokovic revealed he is not 100 percent fit but “fine and adequate” to play at Melbourne Park.
The 12-times grand slam winner is hoping to get back to his best after a forgettable 2017, which included an early exit at the Australian Open and a quarter-final loss at Roland Garros before his season ended days after his last-eight defeat at Wimbledon in July.

American Donald Young was knocked out in the second round at the Australian Open last year but went on to reach back-to-back semi-finals in Memphis and Delray Beach. He struggled for consistency for the majority of the campaign.
His best performance in Melbourne came four years ago, when he beat Robin Haase and Andreas Seppi to reach the third round.
