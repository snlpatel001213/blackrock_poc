PARIS—Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said he is holding Russia accountable for a new chemical weapon attack believed to have been conducted by Syrian government forces near Damascus on Monday. 
Moscow’s failure to halt chemical strikes calls into question Russia’s ability to participate in efforts to resolve the Syrian crisis, Mr. Tillerson said Tuesday at the end of a meeting of more than 20 countries on preventing chemical weapon use.
