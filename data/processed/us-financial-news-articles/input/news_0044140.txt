WATERTOWN, Conn., Jan. 24, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Crystal Rock Holdings, Inc. (NYSE MKT:CRVP) announced its financial results for its fiscal year that ended October 31, 2017. These results will be filed on Form 10-K with today.
Operating income was $1.9 million for the fiscal year ending October 31, 2017 compared to $3.5 million for the same period last year. Net income in fiscal 2017 was $560 thousand compared to a net income of $1.2 million for fiscal year 2016. On a per share basis, net income was $.03 per fully diluted share in fiscal 2017, compared to $.06 per fully diluted share in fiscal 2016.
Gross profit as a percentage of sales rose to 54% in fiscal 2017 compared to 51% in fiscal 2016. Gross profit dollars declined $1.3 million in fiscal 2017 going from $33.1 million in 2016 to $31.8 million in 2017 while sales declined $6.3 million from $65.3 million in fiscal 2016 to $59.1 million in fiscal 2017. Much of the sales reduction was attributable to lower sales of non-water related products, which is consistent with the Company’s strategy to focus on higher-margin categories.
“We increased volume for our core product category sales in water and machine rentals. We will continue to transform our customer base and product mix to focus on key customer targets, higher margin and dollar categories and the ongoing exploration of adjacent markets and services,“ stated Peter Baker, President and CEO, Crystal Rock Holdings. “With a challenging economic business climate that includes declining demographics and regulatory and competitive pressures within our operating footprint, we also recognize it’s critically important our back office is efficiently aligned with our front end experience to maintain profitability while delivering the highest levels of service to our customers.”
