BERLIN (Reuters) - Volkswagen ( VOWG_p.DE ) has offered to raise wages for workers at western German facilities in two steps by 3.5 percent and another 2 percent, it said on Tuesday.
The German carmaker has proposed a 30-month wage contract for about 120,000 staff, with the two-step salary increase starting in May, it said in a written statement published after talks with the IG Metall labor union.
The offer also includes a significant improvement in the carmaker’s pension scheme.
“Volkswagen needs a wage agreement with a sense of proportion,” chief wage negotiator Martin Rosik said.
