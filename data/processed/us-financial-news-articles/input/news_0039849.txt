Gap is attempting to recapture the zeitgeist the way the clothing chain did in its '90s heyday, this time with a marketing push featuring a new single by a cutting-edge rap producer. The ad campaign will debut on TV during Sunday's Grammy Awards. It includes a song created by Metro Boomin, the hit-making artist reshaping the sound of pop music. Gap plans to release the song,a contemporary take on the Thompson Twins's '80's smash "Hold Me Now," on music-streaming services this week. The song will play in the television ad. Metro Boomin is the campaign's music director and appears in the ad alongside SZA, the R&B artist whose album is nominated for five Grammys, as well as young YouTube, TV, film, music and social-media stars from around the world.
