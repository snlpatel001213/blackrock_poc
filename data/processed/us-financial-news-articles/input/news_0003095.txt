(Reuters) - The NBA’s leading scorer James Harden will miss at least two weeks with a left hamstring strain, the Houston Rockets said onMonday. 
Harden suffered the injury while driving for a layup in the fourth quarter of a game against the Los Angeles Lakers on Sunday. 
The Rockets said he will be re-evaluated in two weeks. 
Harden is averaging 32.3 points per game along with 9.1 assists and is a leading candidate for the league’s MVP Award. 
Houston (26-9) have lost five of their last six games to fall to second in the Western Conference. Writing by Jahmal Corner in Los Angeles; Editing by Greg Stutchbury
