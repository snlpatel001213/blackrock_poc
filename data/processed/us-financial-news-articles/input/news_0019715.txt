The presidentâ€™s move follows a court ruling on Dec. 13 that required a commission to be set up within 30 days to carry out such an inquiry. That order upheld a recommendation in a 2016 report by the then Public Protector, whose role is to protect standards in public life. Reporting by Tanisha Heiberg; Editing by Gareth Jones
