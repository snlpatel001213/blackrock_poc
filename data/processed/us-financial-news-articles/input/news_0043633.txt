PARIS (Reuters) - Twenty-seven people were injured in a school bus crash in the rural village of Manciet in southwest France on Thursday, the local government body said. 
The crash took place between a bus carrying 45 school students and five adults, and another small vehicle. Emergency services were on the scene, the prefecture said. 
Last month, six adolescents were killed when a train smashed into a school bus on a level crossing outside the town of Perpignan in southwestern France. Reporting by Sudip Kar-Gupta; editing by Luke Baker
