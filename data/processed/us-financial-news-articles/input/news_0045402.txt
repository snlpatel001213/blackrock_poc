RIYADH, Saudi Arabia, Jan. 25, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- SABIC (SABIC: AB), a world leader in chemicals, has agreed to acquire approximately 83 million shares in Clariant (VTX: CLN), a global specialty chemicals company, from 40 North and Corvex Management. The acquisition of this approximately 24.9% stake in Clariant will make SABIC the largest Clariant shareholder and represents another key milestone in SABIC's growth and diversification strategy to become the preferred world leader in chemicals.
