Federal workers to be furloughed if no deal by Monday Reuters Washington is at an impasse.

WASHINGTON — Lawmakers on Sunday entered the second day of a government shutdown with no clear resolution to their differences and facing growing pressure to end the standoff before Monday, when tens of thousands of federal workers would face furloughs if the dispute hasn’t been resolved. 
The standoff will have to be defused in the Senate, where a spending bill needed to reopen the government requires bipartisan support. A group of centrist Democrats and Republicans huddled Sunday afternoon to see if they could hammer out some kind of compromise. 
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) and Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) were also expected to meet, a senior lawmaker said. 
Republicans and Democrats over the weekend ramped up their rhetoric blaming each other for the impasse, which is tied to a dispute over the fate of undocumented immigrants, known as Dreamers, who were brought to the country illegally as children.
