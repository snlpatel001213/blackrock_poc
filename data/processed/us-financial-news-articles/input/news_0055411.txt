MADRID, Jan 30 (Reuters) - Peugeot-owned carmaker Opel and Spanish unions have reached an agreement on worker conditions at one of Peugeotâ€™s three plants in Spain after threats by the car manufacturer to cut investment at a factory that employs around 5,300 people.
Union sources said late on Monday that an accord was reached after more than 12 hours of negotiations and shortly before a deadline set by Peugeot.
No details were immediately available on the agreement although the local newspaper Heraldo said it included a five-year pact, salary freezes for this year and raises.
The Opel factory, which has been operating in Figueruelas, Aragon since 1982, employs around 5,300 people and was running at 80 percent capacity in 2017 when it made 382,250 vehicles.
PSA, the maker of Peugeot and Citroen cars, also has a factory in Vigo, on the northwestern coast of Spain, and a smaller one outside Madrid where production is running at well below capacity.
Opel and PSA employ around 13,000 people in Spain.
