SAO PAULO, Jan 12 (Reuters) - Brazil has made slower-than-expected progress in cutting government spending ahead of presidential elections, a Standard & Poor’s director said on Friday, a day after the agency downgraded the country’s rating deeper into junk territory.
S&P lowered its long-term rating for Brazil sovereign debt to BB- from BB, with a stable outlook, citing less timely and effective policymaking.
In a webcast, S&P managing director Lisa Schineller mentioned successive delays in voting a plan to trim social security spending as a sign of “wear-and-tear” slowing down progress in balancing the budget.
The new rating is underpinned by “slippages and mixed signals in terms of tackling fiscal policy correction,” she said.
Lawmakers have scheduled a lower-house vote on the unpopular pension bill for February 19, but Schineller highlighted the difficulty of passing such as measure in an election year. Policymakers in Brazil tend to struggle to pass austerity measures even with strong backing in Congress, she added. (Reporting by Bruno Federowski; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama and Andrew Hay)
