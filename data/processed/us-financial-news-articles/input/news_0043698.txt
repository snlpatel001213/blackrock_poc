2018 Guidance
The Company today also announced its initial full year 2018 earnings guidance. As previously discussed, beginning in 2018, PAC will report its non-GAAP financial results primarily based on the standardized Funds from Operations ("FFO") methodology adopted by NAREIT. Other than PAC's upcoming fourth quarter and year ended 2017 results, the Company will neither report Core FFO nor provide guidance on Core FFO going forward.
"Our 2018 guidance reflects our confidence in our long-term growth opportunities and our ability to execute our strategic goals," said John A. Williams, Chief Executive Officer of PAC. Mr. Williams added, "The classic NAREIT definition of FFO is one of the most commonly utilized non-GAAP measures currently in practice for real estate investment trusts like PAC and we believe that reporting our financial results using FFO will be a useful analytical tool for our stockholders."
Net income (loss) per share - We are actively adding properties and real estate loan investments to our real estate portfolio and the specific timing of the closing of acquisitions is difficult to predict. Such activity by nature can cause material variations in our reported depreciation and amortization expense and interest income. Since net income (loss) per share is calculated net of depreciation and amortization expense, our net income (loss) results can fluctuate widely. For this reason, we are unable to reasonably forecast this measure or provide a reconciliation of our projected FFO per share to this measure.
FFO per share – We currently project Funds from Operations, or FFO to be in the range of $1.43 - $1.47 per share for the full year 2018.
Revenue – We currently project total revenues to be in the range of $400 million to $440 million for the full year 2018.
Common Stock Dividends - We currently expect to increase our Common Stock dividend by an aggregate of at least 10% during 2018 as compared to 2017.
Estimated Income Tax Treatment of 2017 Distributions
The Company also announced today how it expects its 2017 distributions to be classified for federal income tax purposes. Stockholders are encouraged to consult with their personal tax advisors as to their specific tax treatment of these distributions. The estimated distribution classifications are shown on the charts below. This release is based on the preliminary results of work on PAC's tax filings and is subject to correction or adjustment when the filings are completed.
PAC is releasing information at this time to aid those required to distribute Form 1099s on the Company's distributions. No material change in these classifications is expected.

Definitions of Non-GAAP Measures
Funds From Operations Attributable to Common Stockholders and Unitholders ("FFO")
Analysts, managers and investors make certain adjustments to reported net income amounts under U.S. GAAP in order to better assess these vehicles' operating results. FFO is one of the most commonly utilized Non-GAAP measures currently in practice. In its 2002 "White Paper on Funds From Operations," which was most recently revised in 2012, the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, or NAREIT, standardized the definition of how Net income/loss should be adjusted to arrive at FFO, in the interests of uniformity and comparability.
The NAREIT definition of FFO (and the one reported by the Company) is:
Net income/loss:
excluding impairment charges on and gains/losses from sales of depreciable property; plus depreciation and amortization of real estate assets and deferred leasing costs; and after adjustments for the Company's proportionate share of unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures.
Not all companies necessarily utilize the standardized NAREIT definition of FFO, so caution should be taken in comparing the Company's reported FFO results to those of other companies. The Company's FFO results are comparable to the FFO results of other companies that follow the NAREIT definition of FFO and report these figures on that basis. The Company believes FFO is useful to investors as a supplemental gauge of our operating results.
