(Adds details on impairments on Q4 NII) 
MADRID, Jan 31 (Reuters) - Banco Santander posted on Wednesday a 4 percent fall in fourth-quarter net profit from a year earlier, hurt by extraordinary impairments in its U.S. unit that offset solid underlying results from Spain’s biggest lender. 
Santander, the euro zone’s biggest bank in terms of market value, reported a net profit of 1.54 billion euros ($1.92 billion) for the October-December period. Analysts had expected net profit to come in at 1.46 billion euros in the quarter. 
Its bottom line was hit by impairments of 752 million euros, mainly on its U.S. consumer finance group, that were not entirely offset by a capital gain of 297 million euros on the sale of its platform Allfunds. 
Excluding the extraordinary charges, underlying net profit in the quarter rose 9 percent, boosted by a strong performance in its largest market, Brazil. 
Like European rivals, Santander is struggling to lift earnings from loans in Spain as interest rates hover at historic lows and rising competition erodes margins. 
Santander’s net interest income (NII) - a measure of earnings on loans minus deposit costs - was 8.6 billion euros in the quarter, up 6.3 percent from last year but down 0.9 percent against the previous quarter. Analysts polled by Reuters had expected NII to come in at 8.52 billion euros. 
Santander ended December with a core tier-1 fully loaded ratio of 10.84 percent, compared with 10.80 percent in September. 
The lender also said it had delivered on all strategic targets for 2017 and it remained confident it would achieve all targets for 2018. ($1 = 0.8557 euros) (Reporting By Jesús Aguado; Editing by Paul Day and Gopakumar Warrier)
