LONDON—The British pound has gained sharply against the currencies of the country’s trading partners, pushing a key measure of its strength to a level not seen in more than 18 months.
The Bank of England’s Sterling Effective Exchange Rate Index ticked above 80 this week, reaching its highest level since the end of June 2016, when the pound was experiencing extreme volatility following Britain’s vote to leave the European Union on June 23.
