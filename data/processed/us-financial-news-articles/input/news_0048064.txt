(Reuters) - The S&P and the Dow scaled new highs on Friday, driven by strong earnings from Intel and drugmaker AbbVie as well as a weaker dollar, putting the three main indexes on track for their best four-week rally since 2016. 
Intel’s ( INTC.O ) shares surged about 9 percent to their highest in almost two decades, after results indicated that the chipmaker’s shift to higher-margin data-center business was gaining pace.

The S&P healthcare index .SPXHC was the biggest gainer among the 11 major S&P sectors, up 1.3 percent, led by gains in AbbVie, Pfizer and Gilead. 
Pfizer ( PFE.N ) rose 3.6 percent after European regulator recommended granting marketing approval to a diabetes drug developed by the company and Merck ( MRK.N ).
