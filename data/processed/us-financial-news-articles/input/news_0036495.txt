WARSAW, Jan 22 (Reuters) - Bank Pekao SA, Poland’s second largest lender, expects its net profit to rise by at least 10 percent in 2018, the Rzeczpospolita daily reports, quoting Chief Executive Officer Michal Krupinski.
“I hope for a double-digit dynamics in terms of our revenues and net profit this year,” Krupinski told Rzeczpospolita daily.
Pekao will release its 2017 net profit on Feb. 27.
