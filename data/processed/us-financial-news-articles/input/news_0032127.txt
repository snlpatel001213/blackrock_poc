MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexican authorities said there were no immediate reports of damage and ruled out a tsunami risk from an earthquake that struck in the Gulf of California on Friday.
The U.S. Geological Survey said the quake measured at 6.3 magnitude, after initially reporting it at 6.6. The epicenter was 77 kilometers (48 miles) north-north east of the town of Loreto in the state of Baja California Sur, the USGS said.
Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto said on Twitter there were no immediate reports of damage or casualties.
