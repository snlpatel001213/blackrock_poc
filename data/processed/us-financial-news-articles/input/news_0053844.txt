LOS ANGELES (AP) — The Latest on a management shake-up at The Los Angeles Times (all times local):
5:30 p.m.
The Los Angeles Times' parent company says Jim Kirk has been officially named the newspaper's editor in chief.
In a move that was expected, Tronc, Inc. announced Kirk's hiring late Monday.
The previous top editor, Lewis D'Vorkin, has been named chief content officer for Chicago-based Tronc, Inc..
Kirk is a former editor and publisher of the Chicago Sun-Times.
He was briefly interim editor in chief at the LA Times before D'Vorkin got the job in August.
The moves come at a time of tension and upheaval at the Times, where publisher Ross Levinsohn is on leave and under investigation for workplace misconduct on previous jobs.
The newsroom recently voted to unionize.

A spokeswoman for Los Angeles Times' parent company says it plans to announce Monday that Jim Kirk will be named the newspaper's editor in chief.
Tronc, Inc. spokeswoman Marisa Kollias said Sunday The Times' current top editor, Lewis D'Vorkin, is expected to be named chief content officer.
The newspaper reported that Kirk was previously publisher and editor of the Chicago Sun-Times and joined Tronc in August.
He was named interim editor of the Times on Aug. 21 after a shake-up but stepped aside after D'Vorkin joined The Times in early November.
The Times said its newsroom has become alarmed by recent hirings of several news executives who report to business executives — not to editors in the newsroom.
