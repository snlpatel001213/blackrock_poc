"The fourth quarter was another strong performance for our title insurance business, as we generated adjusted pre-tax title earnings of $273 million and an adjusted pre-tax title margin of 14.7%," said Chairman William P. Foley, II. "For full-year 2017, we generated more than $1 billion in adjusted pre-tax title earnings and an adjusted pre-tax title margin of 14.5%.
"Overall, 2017 was a very successful strategic year for our company on a number of fronts, as we continued to deploy capital in our ongoing quest to create value for our shareholders. We simplified our corporate structure through the completion of two transactions during the year. We closed the tax-free distribution of Black Knight in September and then the exchange of the FNFV tracking stock for a new Cannae Holdings common stock and subsequent split-off of Cannae Holdings in November.
"We continued to strengthen our title insurance business, acquiring ten title and escrow companies during the year. We also continued building our real estate technology offerings aimed at real estate brokers through the Real Geeks and SkySlope acquisitions and are now focused on integrating our real estate technologies to offer a suite of best of breed technology solutions to our real estate agent customers and further solidify our relationships with this vital group of clients.
"We also devoted $549 million for the repurchase of our outstanding convertible bonds during the year, eliminating the need to issue nearly 12 million shares of FNF common stock if the notes had been converted based on the year-end conversion price.
"Additionally, for the sixth straight year, our board decided to increase our quarterly cash dividend, with our fourth quarter 2017 dividend increasing to $0.27 per share, an 8% increase from the previous quarterly dividend.
"We believe our company is well-positioned as we enter 2018 and we look forward to executing on our business plans and deploying capital to maximize returns for our shareholders."

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information
Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) is the term used to refer to the standard framework of guidelines for financial accounting. GAAP includes the standards, conventions, and rules accountants follow in recording and summarizing transactions and in the preparation of financial statements. In addition to reporting financial results in accordance with GAAP, the Company has provided non-GAAP financial measures, which it believes are useful to help investors better understand its financial performance, competitive position and prospects for the future. These non-GAAP measures include adjusted pre-tax earnings from continuing operations, adjusted pre-tax earnings from continuing operations as a percentage of adjusted revenue (adjusted pre-tax title margin from continuing operations), adjusted net earnings from continuing operations and adjusted EPS from continuing operations.
Any non-GAAP measures should be considered in context with the GAAP financial presentation and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for GAAP net earnings. Further, FNF's non-GAAP measures may be calculated differently from similarly titled measures of other companies. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to related GAAP measures are provided below.
