“Governor Kuroda has met my expectations with job availability at a 43-year high,” Abe said in a programme by public broadcaster NHK. 
“I want him to keep up his efforts. But I haven’t made up my mind” on who should be next BOJ governor when Kuroda’s current term ends in April next year. Reporting by Leika Kihara; Editing by Meredith Mazzilli
