North returned from a lengthy layoff due to a knee ligament injury, which ruled him out of Wales’ November internationals, as a substitute in Saturday’s 50-21 defeat by Harlequins and picked up another knock to the same area. 
Saints said that the 25-year-old will require up to four weeks of rehabilitation. 
“I‘m sure George will be diligent in his rehab and we all wish him a swift recovery,” Northampton Technical Coaching Consultant Alan Gaffney said on the club’s website (www.northamptonsaints.co.uk). 
North, who has 69 caps for Wales, is the latest to join a lengthy injury list for Warren Gatland’s side, with the likes of Taulupe Faletau, Sam Warburton, Jonathan Davies and Dan Lydiate also sidelined.
