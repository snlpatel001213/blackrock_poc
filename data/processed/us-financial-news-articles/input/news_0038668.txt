DUBAI, Jan 24 (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia plans to keep its crude oil exports at around 7 million barrels per day for the first quarter despite planned refinery shutdowns, industry sources said, as the OPEC producer is determined to end a supply glut and boost prices.
The worldâ€™s top oil exporter aims to hold its production at around 9.8 million bpd level from January until March, the sources said.
