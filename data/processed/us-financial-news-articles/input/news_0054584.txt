"James is consistently a top producer and, unquestionably, one of the leading investment sales professionals in the business. By bringing him on board, we are underscoring our commitment to building a team of top players in this market. He is the ideal choice to oversee our investment sales platform and expand our capital markets footprint throughout the New York City area."
Liebersohn continues: "For two decades, James has earned a stellar reputation in this market by identifying trends and strategically helping clients solve even the most complex of investment sales issues. We are confident that his exceptional abilities will continue the already substantial growth trajectory of our investment sales service line and will also boost the recruitment of new talent as we expand our team of industry-leading producers."
While managing the day-to-day operations of the New York Metro Area investment sales practice, Nelson will work closely with Liebersohn and Arthur Mirante , Avison Young Principal and President of the firm's Tri-State region.
"James has played an integral role in the New York City real estate market and is a highly regarded industry leader," notes Mirante. "He brings a depth of knowledge to his new position at Avison Young, where he will lead a team of professionals in a variety of client-service offerings, including asset disposition, asset recapitalization, market research and financial analysis. He has unmatched proficiency and capability in all aspects of the acquisition and disposition of investment-grade real estate, as well as development and redevelopment transactions on behalf of institutional and private-capital clients across all property types."
In 2016, Nelson was Cushman & Wakefield's top investment sales producer in the U.S. Prior to joining Cushman & Wakefield, he was a partner and top producer for Massey Knakal for six of the organization's last eight years and was named the company's youngest partner in 2004. While at Massey Knakal, he was involved in the sale of approximately 400 properties and loans with an aggregate value of more than $3.8 billion.
"I am grateful to Cushman & Wakefield and hold the firm in the highest regard. I am especially thankful to Paul Massey and Bob Knakal for all they have done throughout my career. I look forward to this next great opportunity that lies ahead," states Nelson.
Nelson currently sits as chair of the Real Estate Board of New York (REBNY) commercial board of directors and is a panelist and instructor for the organization. He also co-founded The Colgate Real Estate Council and Real Estate Services Alliance (RESA). In addition, Nelson has been a guest lecturer and adjunct professor in New York University's Schack Institute of Real Estate. He also produces the Nelson Report, a Real Estate Weekly video series featuring trends in the market and timely topics.
