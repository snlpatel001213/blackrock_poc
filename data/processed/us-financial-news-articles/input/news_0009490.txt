ATLANTA, Jan. 10, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Georgia Power today announced the selection of 42 new teachers from across the state to receive one of the company's annual $1,000 New Teacher Assistance Grants. Since the program's inception in 2004, the company has awarded a total of $445,000 in individual grants to more than 400 new teachers from communities across the state. The grants provide the state's newest teachers with funds to purchase classroom supplies and start their teaching careers.
"Georgia's students are our future workforce and are learning the skills they need to be successful every day in the classroom," said Anne Kaiser, vice president of community and economic development for Georgia Power. "Supporting high quality public education starts with supporting the educators on the front lines and the grants are one way that we can show new teachers that their work is appreciated."
Georgia public colleges and universities that have schools of education submitted the final nominations. To be eligible for a grant, candidates must be in the top 25 percent of their class, be a first-year teacher employed by a public school in Georgia and demonstrate a high aptitude for teaching.
The recipients vary from pre-K to elementary, middle and high school teachers. Teachers are encouraged to use the funds to purchase school items such as books, educational CDs or DVDs, computers, projectors, or other supplies to enhance their classrooms and student's learning experience.
