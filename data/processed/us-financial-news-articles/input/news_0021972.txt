Miami’s other double-figure scorer was small forward Josh Richardson, who had 16 points.

Milwaukee also got 16 points from forward Khris Middleton and 15 points from guard Malcolm Brogdon.

There was a similar pattern in the second quarter, as Miami closed with an 8-2 run, cutting Milwaukee’s lead to 43-41 at halftime.
