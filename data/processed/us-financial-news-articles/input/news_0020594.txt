And see: Simone Biles is about to prove she’s the greatest gymnast of all time 
Nassar is due to be sentenced starting Tuesday on sexual-assault charges in Michigan, to which he has pleaded guilty and dropped a longstanding defense that invasive procedures he had carried out on female athletes were a legitimate medical technique. He has already been sentenced to 60 years in prison on federal child-pornography charges. 
USA Gymnastics said in a written statement Monday night that the organization “is absolutely heartbroken, sorry and angry that Simone Biles or any of our athletes have been harmed by the horrific acts of Larry Nassar. USA Gymnastics’ support is unwavering for Simone and all athletes who courageously came forward to share their experiences. We are our athletes’ advocates. USA Gymnastics will continue to listen to our athletes and our members in our efforts of creating a culture of empowerment with a relentless focus on athlete safety every single day.”
