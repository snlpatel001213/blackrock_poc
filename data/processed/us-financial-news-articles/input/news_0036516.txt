WARREN, Pa., Jan. 22, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Northwest Bancshares, Inc. (NasdaqGS: NWBI) announced net income for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 of $22.1 million, or $0.22 per diluted share. This represents a decrease of $2.4 million, or 9.6%, compared to the same quarter last year when net income was $24.5 million or $0.24 per diluted share. The annualized returns on average shareholders' equity and average assets for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 were 7.31% and 0.94% compared to 8.37% and 1.01% for the same quarter last year.
The Company also announced that its Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.17 per share payable on February 15, 2018, to shareholders of record as of February 1, 2018. This represents a 6.25% increase over the prior quarter and is the 93rd consecutive quarter in which the Company has paid a cash dividend. Based on the market value of the Company's common stock as of December 31, 2017, this dividend represents an annualized yield of approximately 4.1%.
In making this announcement, William J. Wagner, Chairman and CEO, noted, "2017 was a year of significant restructuring for our company. With a goal of reducing operating expenses, improving efficiency and narrowing our business focus, we divested our Maryland offices, closed our consumer finance subsidiary, sold our retirement services business, consolidated our wealth management platforms and achieved full integration of our recent acquisitions in Ohio and New York. While these initiatives negatively impacted earnings in 2017, we expect that they will provide a meaningful reduction in our expense ratios in the years ahead. We were pleased to realize continued improvement in net interest margin during 2017 resulting primarily from commercial loan growth of 5% accompanied by 11% growth in noninterest bearing checking accounts. With that, our current margin of 3.93% represents an historic high for our institution. Looking ahead, our company will be primarily focused on improving loan growth and operating efficiency in an effort to continue to improve our company's return on assets."
Net interest income increased by $1.3 million, or 1.6%, to $84.2 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, from $82.9 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2016. This increase is due primarily to a $1.5 million, or 1.7%, increase in interest income on loans receivable and an $850,000, or 39.2% increase in interest income on mortgage-backed securities. These increases were primarily due to increases of $16.8 million and $98.3 million in the average balances of loans and mortgage-backed securities, respectively. Additionally, the average yield on loans and mortgage-backed securities increased by 5 and 29 basis points, respectively, over the prior year.
The provision for loan losses increased by $4.4 million, to $6.5 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, from $2.1 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2016. This increase is due primarily to higher provisions for consumer loans, which were related to the July 2017 closure of the Company's consumer finance subsidiary, as credit quality in other components of the loan portfolio improved. The percentage of total delinquent loans to total loans decreased to 1.51% at December 31, 2017 from 1.61% at December 31, 2016 and total nonaccrual loans decreased by $15.0 million, or 19.0%, to $64.5 million at December 31, 2017 from $79.5 million at December 31, 2016.
Noninterest income decreased by $1.9 million, or 7.7%, to $22.9 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, from $24.8 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2016. Contributing to this decrease was a $2.1 million decrease in mortgage banking income relating to a substantial decrease in the amount of loans sold into the secondary market this year versus the prior year. Additionally, the Company realized a net loss of $369,000 on the sale of investments during the quarter while realizing a net profit of $213,000 a year ago. The loss incurred in the current year related to the sale of two pooled trust preferred securities to take advantage of the recent changes in the federal tax rates. Partially offsetting these decreases was an increase in income from bank owned life insurance of $1.0 million as a result of death benefits received during the quarter.
Noninterest expense increased by $3.1 million, or 4.6%, to $71.9 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, from $68.8 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2016. This increase resulted primarily from a $2.2 million, or 6.1%, increase in compensation and employee benefits due primarily to increases in the cost of health insurance and other employee benefits. Also contributing to the increase was an increase of $857,000 in professional services due primarily to ongoing efforts to comply with the CECL standard effective January 1, 2020.
Income tax expense decreased by $5.8 million, or 46.8%, to $6.6 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, from $12.4 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2016. This decrease is due primarily to a decrease in income before taxes of $8.1 million and the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which was signed into law on December 22, 2017. When enacted, the tax law change will decrease the corporate tax rate from 35.0% to 21.0%. As a result, the value of the Company's net deferred tax liability decreased by $3.1 million, which had the effect of decreasing current period tax expense.
Net income for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $94.5 million, or $0.92 per diluted share, which represents an increase of $44.8 million, or 90.2%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, when net income was $49.7 million, or $0.49 per diluted share. The returns on average shareholders' equity and average assets for the year ended December 31, 2017 were 7.95% and 0.99%, respectively, compared to 4.28% and 0.55% for the same period last year. This increase is due primarily to the sale of the Company's Maryland offices at a profit of $17.2 million during 2017 and also to a $37.0 million penalty incurred from the prepayment of FHLB borrowings during 2016.
Non-GAAP net income for the year ended December 31, 2017, which excludes the after-tax impact of the gain on sale of the Maryland offices of $10.3 million and after-tax restructuring expenses of $2.7 million as well as the aforementioned $3.1 million tax benefit was $83.7 million, or $0.83 per diluted share. Non-GAAP net income for the year ended December 31, 2016, which excludes the after-tax impact of the FHLB prepayment penalty, restructuring and acquisition expenses, and ESOP termination expenses totaling $32.6 million, was $82.3 million, or $0.82 per diluted share.

* The table summarizes the Company's results from operations on a GAAP basis and on an operating (non-GAAP) basis for the periods indicated. Operating results exclude certain income and expenses, net of tax benefit and cost. The net tax effect was calculated using statutory tax rates of approximately 40%.
