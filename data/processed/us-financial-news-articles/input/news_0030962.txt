LONDON, Jan 18 (Reuters) - European shares notched up modest gains on Thursday, falling short of a rally that lifted Wall Street and Asia to new records.
The pan-European STOXX 600 rose 0.1 percent by 0824 GMT but the UK’s FTSE and Italy’s FTSE MIB retreated 0.1 percent.
Switzerland’s Geberit posted the best performance among European stocks, with a 4.8 percent rise after reporting a 3.5 percent increase in 2017 sales.
In France, Carrefour led the CAC 40 higher with a 2 percent rise, with traders saying stronger-than-expected fourth quarter sales from the supermarket chain had offset the negative impact of a new profit forecast cut.
In Frankfurt, German chipmaker Infineon led the DAX higher, adding 3.4 percent after getting a rating upgrade from Goldman Sachs.
Telecoms were the worst performing sector with BT and Vodafone losing 1.3 percent and 1.8 percent respectively. (Reporting by Julien Ponthus; Editing by Tom Pfeiffer)
