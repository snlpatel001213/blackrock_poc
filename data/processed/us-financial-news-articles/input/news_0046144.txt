Jan 25 (Reuters) - Intel Corp, which is rushing to fix recently disclosed security flaws in its chips, reported a 4.1 percent rise in quarterly revenue, helped by strong growth in its data center business.
The company reported a loss of $687 million, or 15 cents per share, in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 30, due to an income tax expense of $5.4 billion as a result of the recent tax reforms.
The company had posted a profit of $3.56 billion, or 75 cents per share, a year earlier.
Total revenue rose to $17.05 billion from $16.37 billion.
Intelâ€™s shares were up 4.3 percent in extended trading. (Reporting by Laharee Chatterjee in Bengaluru; Editing by Saumyadeb Chakrabarty)
