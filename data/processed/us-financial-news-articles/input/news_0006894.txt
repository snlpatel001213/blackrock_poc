LONDON (Reuters) - Barclays ( BARC.L ) has appointed Kunal Gandhi as head of corporate broking and Rob Mayhew as his deputy, according to an internal memo seen by Reuters on Friday. 
Gandhi helped build Barclaysâ€™ corporate broking business by advising clients including insurer Legal & General ( LGEN.L ) and the London Stock Exchange ( LSE.L ), the memo said. 
Corporate broking is a banking business common in Britain but little seen elsewhere and involves lenders providing long-term strategic advice to corporate customers.
