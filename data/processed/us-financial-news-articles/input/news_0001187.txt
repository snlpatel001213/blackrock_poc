FORT WORTH, Texas, Jan. 3, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Buxton has released its 2018 Retail and Restaurant Real Estate Outlook, an annual report that forecasts major trends and identifies top markets for growth opportunities. This year's report provides an update on the state of both the retail and restaurant industries, key trends shaping those industries and a ranking of hot markets based on Buxton client activity through the company's SCOUT analytics tool.
While past editions of the report featured trends and hot markets for the retail industry, this year's report also includes helpful insights on the restaurant industry. This report also features market rankings based on both past history and future potential. In 2017, Dallas-Fort Worth, Texas, was the most evaluated market by Buxton clients, which may suggest the market could claim the top spot for site openings in 2018.
"In the ever-changing retail and restaurant environments, it's important to make confident and informed site selection decisions," said Tom Buxton, president and CEO of Buxton. "Buxton is pleased to offer this resource to industry professionals to guide their efforts in the new year."
