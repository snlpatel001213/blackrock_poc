Cash position of €8.8 million at December 31, 2017, reflecting a substantial reduction in cash burn over the second half
PARIS--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Regulatory News:
STENTYS (Paris:STNT) (FR0010949404 – STNT) , a medical technology company commercializing the Xposition S self-apposing coronary stent, today reports its revenues for the fourth quarter and full year 2017.
Change in revenues
Annual 4 th quarter € thousands 2017 2016 % change 2017 2016 % change Revenues* 7,035 7,318 -4% 1,872 1,980 -5% * Unaudited data
During the fourth quarter of 2017, STENTYS recorded revenues of €1.9 million, driven by the substantial acceleration in sales of the Xposition S drug-eluting stent (+35% in volume and +12% in value). The end of the commercialization of previous-generation stents, DES and BMS, and the decrease in sales of non-proprietary products led to a 5% fall in revenues compared with the fourth quarter of 2016.
The Xposition S stent accounted for 87% of STENTYS’ total revenues in 2017, and benefited from fast-growing demand throughout the year.
Over 2017 as a whole, STENTYS recorded sales of €7.0 million, versus €7.3 million in 2016.
Substantial reduction of the cash burn: cash position of €8.8 million at December 31, 2017
At December 31, 2017, STENTYS had a cash position of €8.8 million, versus €10.3 million at June 30, 2017, reflecting a substantial reduction of the cash burn during the second half of the year as a result of the cost-cutting program implemented by the Company.
Christophe Lottin, Chief Executive Officer of STENTYS, comments: “2017 was a transitional year for STENTYS during which we reorganized our offering by focusing our resources on our flagship product, Xposition S, with the aim of accelerating its penetration of our strategic markets. The Xposition S sales momentum observed during the fourth quarter validates the relevance of our strategy for this specialty drug-eluting stent that is generating considerable interest among the global cardiology community. In accordance with our intention of expanding our proprietary product portfolio, we have added Serpentis, our new latest-generation drug-eluting stent for routine procedures, to our product range at the end of the year. Its pre-commercialization has begun in a number of pilot European facilities. We thus now have a solid offering of proprietary drug-eluting stents on which we expect to see a return to a strong growth in 2018.”
