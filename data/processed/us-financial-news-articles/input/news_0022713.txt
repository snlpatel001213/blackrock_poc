BRUSSELS (Reuters) - An EU court ruled on Tuesday that the European Commission had been right to order France to recover 1.37 billion euros (1.22 billion pounds) in state aid from utility group EDF ( EDF.PA ). 
The Commission took the decision in 2015 after the court had annulled an earlier repayment order. The court said that EDF had repaid the amount in October 2015, although it then had brought a challenge to the General Court of the European Union, the EUâ€™s second-highest court.
