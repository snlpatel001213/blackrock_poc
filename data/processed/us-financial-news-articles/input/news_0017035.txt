Haiti's ambassador to Washington on Friday called on U.S. President Donald Trump to apologize if he used vulgar language to describe Haitians and o ther immigrants in a White House meeting with U.S. lawmakers over an immigration overhaul plan.
"We hope he didn't say those things. If he did, we just hope he apologizes, not just to the Haitian community but to the American people," Ambassador Paul Altidor said in an interview on MSNBC, adding that Trump's reported comments at Thursday's meeting were "regrettable" and "counterproductive" to U.S.-Haiti relations.
