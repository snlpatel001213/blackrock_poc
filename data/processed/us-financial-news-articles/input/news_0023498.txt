LOS ANGELES, DTT announced today the appointment of Mike Coffey as Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Coffey is a two-time CEO with 15+ years of executive experience in technology enabled companies, and will lead DTT's day to day operations. Sam Naficy, DTT's previous CEO and founder remains dedicated to DTT and will assume the position as Chairman of the Board of Directors.
"I'm thrilled to transition into a new role at such an exciting time for the company," said Mr. Naficy. "Being Chairman of the Board will allow me to focus on strategy and M&A opportunities. While I will miss working in a direct capacity at DTT, I couldn't be more confident that Mike will successfully lead our growth and deliver significant benefits for our customers and our team."
Mr. Coffey comes to DTT after successfully having held executive leadership positions across Internet of Things, SaaS, and Managed Services businesses. Most recently, Mr. Coffey was the CEO of Wyless, an IoT and M2M business.

"I am extremely excited because of DTT's stellar reputation," said Mr. Coffey. "I knew there was an excellent opportunity for DTT to leverage my skills and experience with technology enabled businesses into new growth opportunities. I'm looking forward to spending the first few months learning more about the company, getting to know the DTT team and our tremendous customers, and ensuring we work together to continue providing truly innovative loss prevention solutions to the hospitality and retail industries."
DTT also recently announced the closing of an $80 Million Facility with Capital One as well as the acquisition of LP Innovations Inc.
