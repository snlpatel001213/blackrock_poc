Elon Musk’s SpaceX said it wasn’t responsible for the loss of an expensive U.S. spy satellite it launched over the weekend, pointing instead to unspecified problems with the payload or mechanisms that attached it and eventually were supposed to release it from the rocket. 
But Tuesday’s terse company statement — coupled with continuing silence from federal authorities and a flurry of sometimes contradictory media reports — left the precise cause of the botched mission as unclear as ever. 
Lawmakers and congressional staffers from the Senate and the House have been briefed about the satellite — code-named Zuma and launched from Florida onboard a Falcon 9 rocket — which is believed to have plummeted back into the atmosphere, according to government and industry officials. Presumed to be a total loss, the satellite didn’t separate as planned from the upper part of the rocket, these officials said. 
Space Exploration Technologies Corp., as the company is formally known, in its latest statement appeared to pin the blame elsewhere by saying a data review indicated the rocket “did everything correctly” and management has concluded “no design, operational or other changes are needed.”
