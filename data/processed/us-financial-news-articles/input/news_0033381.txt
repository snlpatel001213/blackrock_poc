PARIS, Jan 21 (Reuters) - French luxury goods conglomerate LVMH said on Sunday it has appointed former Yves Saint Laurent star designer Hedi Slimane as artistic director of its Celine label.
His predecessor Phoebe Philo left the high-end ready-to-wear brand in January after turning Celine into one of fashion’s most sought-after labels over the past 10 years.
LVMH Chief Executive Bernard Arnault said Slimane will oversee and develop both women’s and men’s fashion, leather goods, accessories and fragrances.
“Hedi ... is one of the most talented designers of our time ... His arrival at Celine reinforces the great ambitions that LVMH has for this house,” Arnauld said in the company’s statement.
Slimane, who has designed clothes for rock star David Bowie and actor Brad Pitt, worked for LVMH group’s Dior Homme in the 2000s.
