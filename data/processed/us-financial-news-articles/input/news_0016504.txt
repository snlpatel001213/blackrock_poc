ANKARA, Jan 12 (Reuters) - Turkey’s prime minister said on Friday the case of two journalists detained for more than a year over a failed 2016 coup would be decided by a local court, after the country’s Constitutional Court had ruled that they be released.
“Whether we like the Constitutional Court’s ruling or not, the authority that will make the right call is the first instance court,” Binali Yildirim told reporters.
