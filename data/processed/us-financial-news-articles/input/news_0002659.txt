Jan 1 (Reuters) - Suspended England all-rounder Ben Stokes has been withdrawn from the squad for this month’s five-match one-day international series against Australia and was replaced by batsman Dawid Malan, the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) said on Monday. 
Stokes, who was provisionally named in England’s squad, is awaiting a decision on whether he will be charged by the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) for his involvement in an altercation outside a Bristol nightclub in September. 
The ECB said he would not travel with the group of players leaving for Australia on Tuesday and his availability will depend on CPS advice. 
“Should ECB receive formal confirmation that he has either, a) been charged or, b) will face no charges, the ECB board would convene within 48 hours to make a decision on his availability to represent England at that stage,” ECB said in a statement on their website (www.ecb.co.uk). 
The ECB said Stokes has been cleared to participate in the player draft for the Indian Premier League Twenty20 tournament. 
The first ODI between Australia and England will be played at the Melbourne Cricket Ground on Jan. 14. (Reporting by Shrivathsa Sridhar in Bengaluru; editing by Sudipto Ganguly)
