LONDON, Jan 8 (Reuters) - British house prices unexpectedly fell in December compared with November, their first fall in six months, mortgage lender Halifax said on Monday, adding to signs of weakness in the countryâ€™s housing market since the 2016 Brexit vote. 
House prices slipped by 0.6 percent month-on-month after a 0.3 percent rise in November, Halifax said. That compared with the consensus forecast for a 0.2 percent rise in a Reuters poll of economists. 
On an annual basis, house prices rose 2.7 percent in the three months to December compared with the same period in 2016, slowing from a 3.9 percent rise in November. The Reuters poll of economists had pointed to a 3.3 percent rise. (Writing by William Schomberg; Editing by Peter Graff)
