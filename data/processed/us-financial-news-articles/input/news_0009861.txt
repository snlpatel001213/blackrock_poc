TEL AVIV, Jan 9 (Reuters) - Israel’s Kenon Holdings Ltd said on Tuesday a China-based investor related to the Baoneng group has acquired 51 percent of its Qoros Automobile joint venture after the deal obtained approval from China’s Ministry of Commerce. The Baoneng-related investor paid 6.63 billion yuan ($1 billion) for the stake.

Kenon has an option to sell its remaining stake in Qoros for 3.12 billion yuan and the investor has an option to increase its stake to 67 percent. 
Qoros will be required to repay outstanding shareholder loans to Kenon and Chery in the amount of 944 million yuan.
