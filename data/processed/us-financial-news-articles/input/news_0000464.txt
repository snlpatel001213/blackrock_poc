Trump says sanctions are having an effect on North Korea 11 mins ago Facebook 
On Tuesday, Seoul proposed holding talks with North Korea near their shared border next week. 
Through sanctions, the United Nations has aimed to limit the supply of oil going to North Korea in an effort to curb its nuclear and missile programs. In recent days, South Korea has said it has seized two ships suspected of transferring oil to the regime in violation of sanctions . 
Last week, Trump sent a warning to China following reports that Beijing allowed oil to go into North Korea. China has denied illegally providing oil. 
Reuters separately reported that Russian tankers supplied oil to North Korea , though there is no evidence yet that the Russian state backed the shipments, according to the wire service. 
It is unclear if the ships seized by South Korea are linked to the alleged Chinese and Russian transactions.
