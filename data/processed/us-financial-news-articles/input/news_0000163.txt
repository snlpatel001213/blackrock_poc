WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democrats boosted their ranks in the U.S. Senate on Wednesday, swearing in two lawmakers from Alabama and Minnesota and trimming Republicans’ edge in the chamber to 51-49.
In a ceremony at the U.S. Capitol, the party inducted Doug Jones, who won last month’s special election in Alabama to become the state’s first Democratic senator in 25 years, and Tina Smith, who is replacing Al Franken after he resigned over sexual harassment allegations.
