CAIRO (Reuters) - Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi announced on Friday his intention to run for a second term in office in a March election. 
Egypt is set to hold a presidential vote on March 26-28, with a run-off on April 24-26. Candidates must register between Jan. 20 and 29. 
Sisi came to power in 2014 after leading the military in ousting elected President Mohamed Mursi of the Muslim Brotherhood after mass protests against his rule. Reporting by Amina Ismail and Omar Fahmy; editing by Ralph Boulton
