One-time goodwill impairment charge
A non-cash impairment of goodwill in the Autoliv Nissin Brake Systems joint venture (of which Autoliv owns 51%), with a net income effect to Autoliv of approximately $100 million in the fourth quarter of 2017.

Project costs for the separation and spin-off are expected to be up to $70 million. Mainly related to accounting, finance, legal, IT and listing. Project costs will be booked in the quarter in which they occur, the majority are not expected to be tax deductible. Tax related costs from the separation of the legal entities in preparation for the spin-off are estimated to be up to $80 million. Tax related costs will be recorded at the time of the separation of the legal entities, expected in the first half of 2018.
The spin-off of Electronics is progressing according to schedule and is expected to be completed during the third quarter of 2018, subject to market, regulatory and certain other conditions, including approval by Autoliv's board of directors. The spin-off is as previously communicated expected to be tax free to Autoliv shareholders.
