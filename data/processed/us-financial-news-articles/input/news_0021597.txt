Avino Mine Fourth Quarter 2017 Production Highlights
1.
Tonnage mined increased by 8%, whereas the underground development decreased by 14% as we transition to production mining on the levels that have already been developed to provide mill feed on a sustained basis.
2.
Mill availability was down 6% for the quarter due to the downtime associated with the commissioning of the new HP5 crusher in October. There was insufficient crushed mill feed for the Avino circuit. This has been rectified with the technical assistance from Metso, who are the suppliers of the crusher.
3.
Tonnage processed increased by 8% as Circuit 2 was dedicated to processing Avino material rather than the San Gonzalo for the entire quarter.
4.
Feed material for the quarter primarily came from the main Avino vein, resulting in higher copper, and lower gold and silver, and therefore reflective of the changes of 41%, -53%, and -23% respectively.
5.
With the change in feed and minerology, copper recovery was down 3%, no change in gold recovery and silver recovery increased by 2%.
6.
The changes in the quality of the mill feed resulted in 9% more concentrate produced and the grade of copper increased by 35%, whereas the gold and silver grades decreased by 54% and 22% respectively. In addition, copper production increased by 47%, gold decreased by 50% and silver decreased by 15% resulting in an increase of 6% in silver equivalent ounces for the quarter.
Avino Mine 2017 Year-End Production Highlights
7.
The year over year change in mined tonnes and development is attributed primarily to the transition from development to production mining.
8.
Tonnage processed increased by 7% as Circuit 2 was used exclusively to process Avino material.
9.
Gold feed grade increased by 23% whereas copper and silver decreased by 3% and 4% respectively; the changes in grades are due to the mineralisation in the areas being mined.
10.
Concentrate production increased by 4% with little to no change in the copper and silver grades but the gold increased by 37% due to the higher mill feed.
11.
Gold production increased by 42%, copper by 4% and silver by 2% resulting in 19% more silver equivalent ounces of production.
