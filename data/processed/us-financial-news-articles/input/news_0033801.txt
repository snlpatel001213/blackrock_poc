(Reuters) - British pub operator Marston’s Plc ( MARS.L ) said on Tuesday trading in the Christmas period was marred by snowy and icy weather in the UK and would hurt its annual profit by 1 million pounds. 
The impact of weather on its like-for-like sales in the 16 weeks to Jan. 20 was around 2 percent, Marston’s said. 
However, like-for-like sales excluding the impact of the snow-affected weeks were up 1.1 percent, said the company that runs over 1,500 pubs across the UK. 
The Suffolk-based company, which brews ales such as IPA, Old Speckled Hen, Brakspear and Mansfield, said own-brewed volumes rose 33 percent in the period. 
Marston’s said margins fell slightly from last year due to cost increases, but were in line with expectations. 
Like other operators in the British pub sector, Marston’s has also been battling increased costs, most notably from wage inflation, rising property costs and unfavourable currency exchange rates. 
Marston’s said it remained on target to open 15 pub restaurants and bars and six lodges this year. 
Shares in the company were down 3.1 percent at 111.1 pence at 0804 GMT (9.04 a.m. BST). Reporting by Rahul B in Bengaluru; Editing by Gopakumar Warrier
