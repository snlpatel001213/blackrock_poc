DAVOS, Switzerland (Reuters) - Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Thursday that there was no substitute for the United States to broker a peace deal between Israel and the Palestinians.
“I think there’s no substitute for the United States. As the honest broker, as a facilitator, there’s no other international body that would do it,” Netanyahu said at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.
