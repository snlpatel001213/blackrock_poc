Greece’s Tsitsipas, who ousted French fifth seed Richard Gasquet on Wednesday, took the early lead in the first set but Thiem, the only seeded player still in contention for the season-opening title, fought back to win 7-5 6-4. 
“I was serving well again today and returning well. That’s what I was working on in the off-season so it already pays off now,” Thiem said. 
Croatian Coric was expected to overcome Rublev after beating Pablo Carreno Busta in the opening round but the 20-year-old Russian won 6-3 7-5 to set up a semi-final against Guido Pella. 
Both Pella and his quarter-final opponent Mirza Basic were surprise contenders in the last eight after knocking out top seeded players and the Argentine world number 64 cruised to a 6-2 6-3 victory over the Bosnian. 
World number five Thiem will face Gael Monfils in the last four after the Frenchman beat German Peter Gojowczyk 6-3 7-6(6). Reporting by Aditi Prakash in Bengaluru, editing by Ed Osmond
