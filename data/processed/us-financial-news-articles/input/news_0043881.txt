(Reuters) - Gene testing company Illumina on Thursday won a $26.7 million jury verdict in a U.S. lawsuit accusing rival Ariosa Diagnostics, a subsidiary of Roche Holdings AG, of using patented prenatal testing technology without authorization. 
A federal jury in San Francisco said Ariosaâ€™s Harmony non-invasive prenatal test kits infringed on two Illumina patents. 
Illumina and Ariosa compete in the growing market for non-invasive prenatal tests, which screen for chromosomal conditions like Down syndrome. 
San Diego, California-based Illumina had sought more than $100 million in damages. 
The jury rejected a counterclaim by Ariosa that Illumina had breached a contract between the companies by bringing the lawsuit. Ariosa had sought $88 million in damages from Illumina on that counterclaim. 
Illumina and Ariosa did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
