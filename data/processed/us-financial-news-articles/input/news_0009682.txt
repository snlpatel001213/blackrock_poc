Time Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos. (Photo: Amazon) CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE Jeff Bezos' fortune has topped $105 billion , leading to a flood of headlines about the Amazon founder being "the richest man of all time." By one measure, this is true. Bill Gates had been the richest man ever, with a fortune that topped $100 billion in 1999. So in simple dollar terms, Bezos is now richer. And while some say Vladamir Putin is probably richer, we have no way of knowing since his wealth is kept secret. But wealth is all relative. In inflation-adjusted terms, and as a share of a national economy, Bezos still has a ways to go to be the richest man in history. Let's start with Gates' fortune. In 1999, he became the first person to have 11 zeros. But $100 billion isn't what it used to be. If you adjust for inflation, Gate's $100 billion fortune in 1999 would be worth about $147 billion today. So in inflation-adjusted terms, Bezos is still about $42 billion short of passing Gates.
