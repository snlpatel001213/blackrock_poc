U.S. airlines are among the biggest beneficiaries of the tax plan. They also may be at the greatest danger of competing their tax gains away.
Because nearly all of airlines’ income is taxed domestically, the cutting of the corporate rate to 21% will reduce their tax bill markedly more than multinationals that have been paying lower-than-U.S. tax rates on their foreign operations. Delta Air Lines, for example, has had an effective tax rate of about 35%, while Apple’s has been about 25%.
