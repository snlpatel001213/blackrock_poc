HAMILTON, Ohio, Jan. 3, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Coolants Plus, the parent of STARFIRE branded products and one of the fastest growing oil companies in North America, has announced the purchase of Scot Lubricants, Inc, a blending and packaging facility in eastern Pennsylvania. The new Coolants Plus facility, to be named PennStar , houses 250,000 square feet of production space, 750,000 gallons of tank storage and a state-of-the-art testing lab, giving Coolants Plus and the STARFIRE brand more control over manufacturing, quality assurance and greater flexibility in production and packaging.
