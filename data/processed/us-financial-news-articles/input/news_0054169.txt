STOCKHOLM, Jan 30 (Reuters) - Swedish auto safety gear maker Autoliv on Tuesday forecast higher than expected organic sales growth this year and reported fourth quarter core earnings above market expectations.
Stockholm-based Autoliv, the worldâ€™s largest maker of airbags and seatbelts, forecast 2018 like-for-like sales growth of more than 7 percent compared with a 5.6 percent mean forecast in a Reuters poll of analysts.
The company said its quarterly adjusted operating profit rose to $263 million from $243 million in the year-ago quarter, beating a mean forecast for $247 million in a Reuters poll.
Autoliv said last year it was planning to split into two listed companies, with one focused on high-tech safety gear to capture the rapid growth towards self-driving vehicles. (Reporting by Johannes Hellstrom and Helena Soderpalm; editing by Niklas Pollard)
