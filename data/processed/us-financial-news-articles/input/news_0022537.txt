TUNIS (Reuters) - Police fired tear gas on Sunday to disperse dozens of young protesters in Tunisâ€™s Ettadamen district in renewed protests over a tax hike after a relative lull in the past two days.
A Reuters witness saw youths of around 20 throwing stones at police cars and setting fire to tires before security forces drove them back with tear gas.
