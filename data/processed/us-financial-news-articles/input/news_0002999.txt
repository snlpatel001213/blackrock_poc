White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Thursday that Breitbart News should think about parting ways with executive chairman Steve Bannon, the former White House chief strategist.
Her comment came a day after Bannon's fiery Quote: s about the president's family were released and Trump shot back in a venomous rebuttal.
"I certainly think that it's something they should look at and consider," Sanders said when asked if the generally pro-Trump news outlet should consider parting ways with Bannon.
Her comment came hours after President Donald Trump said he thought Bannon had "changed his tune" from his comments to author Michael Wolff released in part Wednesday.
"He called me a great man last night, so, you know, he obviously changed his tune pretty quick," the president told reporters Thursday at the White House.
"I don't talk to him," Trump added.
The president's remarks were muted compared to the statement he released Wednesday in response to Bannon's comments. After excerpts of an upcoming book showed Bannon calling Donald Trump Jr.'s 2016 meeting with a Russian lawyer "treasonous" and "unpatriotic," Trump unleashed on his former key advisor, who he said had "lost his mind."
In his statement , the president said Bannon — the nationalist firebrand — "had very little to do" with his electoral victory in 2016. Trump added that "Steve is learning that winning isn't as easy as I make it look."
On a radio show Wednesday night, Bannon called Trump "a great man," adding, "You know I support him day in and day out."
A Trump lawyer has sent a cease and desist letter to Bannon demanding that he stop making "disparaging" comments about the president and his family.
