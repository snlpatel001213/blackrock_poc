PETALUMA, Calif., Jan. 3, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- San Francisco Bay Area-based ed tech leader FrontRow has hired Brian Gaiser as its new Director of International Sales.
"The Director of International Sales role is clearly vital to the success of FrontRow's growth in markets beyond the US," says CEO Jens Holstebro. "Brian fits that role particularly well, having 20 years of international business development experience, and almost a third of that being in classroom audio technology sales."

Throughout his career with a variety of US-based companies, Gaiser has focused on international sales, with a particular emphasis on Asia-Pacific and Canada. His recent six-year tenure at Lightspeed equipped him with deep knowledge of local markets for classroom audio, important customer relationships, and an enthusiasm for improving education with audio technology.
"It's a lifelong passion of mine to experience cultural differences, strengthen commonalities, and put great ideas into action. So, getting to help thousands of people improve their learning environments on six continents? I couldn't ask for a better job," shares Gaiser.
