It was along the rail at Maryland’s Laurel Park that I first met Sergei Tolstoy, a great-grandson of the man who wrote “War and Peace.” A count, he had a distinguished—if thinning—bloodline.

He didn’t say much of anything, while Sergei was always eager to tell you which horse would win the next race.
