ATHENS, Jan 22 (Reuters) - Greece's current account deficit shrank in November 2017 compared to the same month a year earlier on the back of a lower trade gap, the Bank of Greece said on Monday. Central bank data showed the deficit at 0.954 billion euros from a deficit of 1.25 billion euros in November 2016. Tourism revenues rose to 225 million euros from 222 million in the same month a year earlier. "In November the current account showed an improvement of 296 million euros year-on-year. This development is almost entirely attributable to a decrease in the deficit of the balance of goods," the Bank of Greece said. In 2016 as a whole, Greece had a current account deficit of 1.1 billion euros versus a surplus of 206 million in 2015 as a result of a lower services balance surplus.
