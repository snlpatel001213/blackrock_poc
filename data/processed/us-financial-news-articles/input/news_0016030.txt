HOLYOKE, Mass., Jan. 16, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- A seasoned Chief Information Officer for some of the world's largest healthcare payor organizations, Terry Ramey has joined Holyoke, Massachusetts-based healthcare consultancy VertitechIT as an Executive Project Officer (EPO). Ramey will lead engagements with large healthcare systems as the company continues to expand operations throughout the east coast and across the country. He previously held senior technology titles at PerformRX (a subsidiary of AmeriHealth Caritas), Penn Mutual Life Insurance, CIGNA Health Services, and Dendrite International.
As a nationally recognized healthcare technology executive, Terry says he was looking to make an impact on the provider side of the industry. "At CIGNA, Penn Mutual, and other major payor organizations, my responsibilities were to leverage technology to positively affect the bottom line," says Ramey. "At VertitechIT, I have the opportunity to help transform hospital IT departments with a direct impact on patient care. It's not often that an IT executive gets to do that."
VertitechIT CEO Michael Feld agrees. "Our work at work at major health systems goes far beyond designing and implementing cloud strategies, overhauling infrastructure, and streamlining operations. As an EPO, Terry will counsel clients on the IT initiatives that can literally change the way doctors do their jobs."
Working at the executive level within a healthcare organization, EPOs oversee a collaborative Office of the CTO (oCTO), implementing VertitechIT's proprietary LeverageITÂ© process. Working side by side with senior internal managers, the oCTO refines strategic directives and implements tactical solutions that make organizations more profitable and efficient.
