WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic leader in the U.S. House of Representatives, said on Friday she hopes that Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer will be able to determine what kind of immigration bill President Donald Trump will support.
Democrats have pushed for protections for young adults who illegally immigrated to the United States as children to be included in an agreement to temporarily fund the government.
“Hopefully Mr. Schumer will find out what the president will sign because I do believe ... the votes are there, in the House, in the Senate,” Pelosi told reporters.
