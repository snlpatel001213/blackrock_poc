BEIRUT (Reuters) - The leader of Lebanon’s Iran-backed Hezbollah group said on Wednesday the Syrian war, now in its seventh year, will be finished in one or two years at most.
In an interview with Lebanon’s pro-Iran al-Mayadeen channel, Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah also said Israeli strikes on Hezbollah positions in Syria did not, and will not, prevent supplies of weapons reaching the group.
Hezbollah and other Iran-backed groups have backed Syria’s President Bashar al-Assad during the conflict which erupted in 2011.
