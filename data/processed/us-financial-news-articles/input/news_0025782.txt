There’s no missile headed for Hawaii, Representative Tulsi Gabbard said, after residents in the state received emergency alerts on their mobile phones advising them to “seek immediate shelter” from an inbound ballistic missile. 
“Hawaii — this is a false alarm,” the Democrat said on Twitter. “I have confirmed with officials there is no incoming missile.” 
The Hawaii Emergency Management Agency also said on its Twitter account that there is “NO missile threat to Hawaii.” SPONSORED FINANCIAL CONTENT
