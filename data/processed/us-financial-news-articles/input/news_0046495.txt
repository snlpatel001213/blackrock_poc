Paul George finished with 18 points, while Carmelo Anthony added 13 for the Thunder, who shot 45 of 87 (51.7 percent) from the field. Oklahoma City has gone 15-0 since Dec. 1 when all five of its normal starters -- Westbrook, George, Anthony, Andre Roberson and Steven Adams -- are in the lineup.

Oklahoma City regained control, and back-to-back 3-pointers by Raymond Felton helped the Thunder carry an 82-74 lead into to the final quarter. The Wizards would not go away, and a 3-pointer by Wall cut the margin to 88-85 with 8:23 left in the game.
A jumper and demonstrative dunk by Westbrook gave Oklahoma City a 90-87 lead with just under eight minutes left. Westbrook continued to dominate, and his dunk off a steal by George gave the Thunder a 10-point lead and forced Washington to call a timeout with 6:41 left.
From there, the Thunder were never threatened. A dunk by Anthony extended Oklahoma Cityâ€™s lead to 116-106 with just over a minute remaining.
The Wizards have allowed 98 or more points in 19 consecutive games. Washington also committed 23 turnovers, which led to 15 points for Oklahoma City.
The Thunder never trailed before the break, and Westbrook scored 15 points to help provide a 54-40 lead at halftime. The Wizards hit just 3 of 13 from beyond the arc in the opening half.
