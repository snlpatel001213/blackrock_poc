NEWSTRIKE REPRESENTS A HIGHLY STRATEGIC AND ACCRETIVE ACQUISITION
Following the completion of the Newstrike acquisition, CanniMed will be more valuable as a company that offers both medical and recreational cannabis products. On a standalone basis CanniMed provides $1.34 EBITDA 1 per share and, with Newstrike, CanniMed shareholders are expected to see 14.6% accretion to $1.54 EBITDA ii per share.
Conversely, by tendering to Aurora’s hostile bid, CanniMed shareholders will see a 48.4% dilution to $0.69 EBITDA i per share based on Aurora’s January 16, 2018 last 20 day VWAP. This means Aurora is offering shareholders $0.85 or 55% less than what a combined CanniMed and Newstrike offers shareholders. As Aurora’s 20 Day VWAP increases, EBITDA per share dilution deteriorates even more for CanniMed’s shareholders due to the capped offer price.
The recent significant run up in Newstrike’s share price makes the acquisition even more attractive, coupled with Newstrike’s recent approval by Health Canada for a cannabis sales license. The combined company will have an established path to 45,000 kg of cannabis production representing $300 - $500 million in revenue iii .
CANNIMED SHARES ARE TRADING ABOVE AURORA’S OFFER
Shareholders should be aware of CanniMed’s recent share price performance following a series of positive announcements including a strategic international cannabis distribution agreement with Fagron NV, a supply agreement with Newstrike, the launch of CanniMed Topical Cream and an application by CanniMed’s US subsidiary for licenses in Michigan to produce and process medical cannabis.
CanniMed’s share price has traded above Aurora’s capped offer for the last 15 days. The market has clearly recognized that Aurora’s hostile bid is insufficient, with CanniMed shares trading above the capped offer price of $24.00 consistently since January 2, 2018.
CanniMed shareholders will own less of Aurora than they should be entitled to. Aurora’s hostile bid only gives CanniMed shareholders minimal ownership of the combined company even though CanniMed has more current production and an equal number of patients. Since the offer was announced, Aurora has participated in the market upturn, while simultaneously preventing CanniMed shareholders from realizing the same value due to the capped $24.00 consideration under Aurora’s hostile bid. While Aurora’s share price has increased, given this $24.00 cap, the consideration available to CanniMed shareholders does not change and ownership in the combined company has been reduced.
Aurora’s hostile bid has prevented CanniMed shareholders from realizing significant value. CanniMed has traded in-line with the index since announcing its intention to enter the recreational market through accretive acquisitions. However, the overhang of Aurora’s hostile bid has prevented CanniMed from participating in the broader market rally and realizing any positive momentum from the Newstrike acquisition.
VOTE GREEN. DO NOT TENDER.
The CanniMed Board and management will vote their GREEN proxies in support of CanniMed’s acquisition of Newstrike and will not tender to Aurora’s hostile bid. The Board strongly recommends shareholders join them in doing the same, no matter how many shares are owned. Here’s how:

Non-IFRS Measure: Earnings before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (“EBITDA”)
CanniMed uses EBITDA as a supplemental financial measure of its operational performance. In addition, analysts use 2019 estimated EBITDA in their published reports. CanniMed believes EBITDA to be an important measure of its and other companies’ capacity to generate cash flow from operations as it excludes the effects of items which primarily reflect the impact of long-term investment and decisions and finance strategies, rather than the performance of CanniMed’s and other companies’ day-to-day operations. CanniMed measures EBITDA as net earnings (loss) from continuing operations plus income taxes expense (recovery), interest expense and depreciation and
