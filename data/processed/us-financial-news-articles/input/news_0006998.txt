Gandhi helped build Barclaysâ€™ corporate broking business by advising clients including insurer Legal & General ( LGEN.L ) and the London Stock Exchange ( LSE.L ), the memo said. 
Corporate broking is a banking business common in Britain but little seen elsewhere and involves lenders providing long-term strategic advice to corporate customers. 
A spokesman for Barclays confirmed the contents of the memo. Reporting By Lawrence White; Editing by Susan Fenton
