MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Belinda Bencic sent an early shockwave through the Australian Open by dumping last year’s finalist Venus Williams out of the first round with an impressive 6-3 7-5 win on Monday.

The 20-year-old Swiss played the 37-year-old American great to perfection, soaking up the fifth seed’s firepower and attacking her wavering serve with abandon under the roof at Rod Laver Arena. 
In a tense grand slam opener that felt more like a final, Venus battled to keep touch in an enthralling second set but Bencic unleashed two blazing forehand winners to close out the match in the 12th game. 
The resurgent Bencic will meet the winner of Johanna Larsson and Luksika Kumkhum in the next round. Related Coverage
