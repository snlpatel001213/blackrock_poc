ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkish lender Halkbank is working closely with the U.S. Treasury and Justice Department, Deputy Prime Minister Mehmet Simsek said on Wednesday, after a U.S. jury found one of its executives guilty in an Iran sanctions-busting trial. 
Simsek made the comment in an interview with broadcaster Bloomberg HT. 
A U.S. jury found Halkbank executive Mehmet Hakan Atilla guilty of helping Iran evade U.S. sanctions, convicting him on five counts, including bank fraud and conspiracy this month, in a case which have strained ties between Ankara and Washington. Writing by Ezgi Erkoyun; Editing by David Dolan
