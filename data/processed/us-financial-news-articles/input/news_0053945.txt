More of Larry Nassar’s victims will get a chance to address him in a court of law Wednesday, as the former doctor for the U.S. gymnastics team returns to a Michigan courtroom for sentencing for similar charges in a different case. 
Last week, Michigan Judge Rosemarie Aquilina sentenced Nassar to 40 to 175 years in prison for sexual abuse after 156 accusers testified against him. 
Now, he faces sentencing for three counts of criminal sexual conduct , two against girls between ages 13 and 15 and one against a girl younger than 13. Nassar pleaded guilty to these charges for abuse that occurred in September 2009 and September 2011 at Gedderts’ Twistars Gymnastics Club in Eaton County, Michigan. Prosecutors are seeking a new sentence of 40 to 125 years in this case. 
At least 65 women are expected to speak at this hearing, which begins Wednesday but could continue into next week as the number of victims addressing the former doctor may grow before the sentencing hearing concludes. 
Elite athletes and Olympic medalists including Aly Raisman , Simone Biles , McKayla Maroney , and Gabby Douglas are among Nassar’s accusers. Raisman and Maroney both gave impact statements at the sentencing hearing last week, which in addition to addressing Nassar himself, also criticized the power structures that allowed the abuse to go on for so long.
