The Dow Jones industrial average broke above 25,000 for the first time on Thursday, tying the fastest 1,000-point move in its history, following the release of stronger-than-expected jobs data.
The 30-stock index climbed 152 points, with General Electric, DowDuPont, Merck and IBM rising about 2 percent.
"The Dow hitting 25,000 was a pretty wild idea even a year ago. And while its symbolically important, the real story is never just a number. It's the underlying strength that is pushing markets this high," said Steve Claussen, vice president of trader strategy at E-Trade.
The Dow broke above 24,000 for the first time on Nov. 30, or 35 calendar days prior to hitting 25,000. It also took the Dow just 35 days to rise from 20,000 to 21,000 last year.
The S&P 500 gained 0.5 percent, with financials rising 1.2 percent. The Nasdaq composite advanced 0.2 percent. Both indexes also hit all-time highs.
"Right now, we're in this Goldilocks scenario," said Tim Courtney, chief investment officer at Exencial Wealth Advisors. "The news has been good. Confidence is up. Everything is lining up just right."

U.S. Treasury yields moved higher after the report was released. The 10-year yield traded at 2.46 percent, while the two-year yield rose to 1.96 percent.
"This was a solid number and with a near record amount of job openings, maybe more people are coming off the sidelines, enticed by higher wages which are coming," said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Financial Group.
