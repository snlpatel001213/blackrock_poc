She will focus on the oncology and rare disease programs. The position is a new one, as CANbridge ramps up its leadership in anticipation of upcoming regulatory filings expected for several of its programs.
Ms. Zhang brings to the position considerable regulatory experience in China in oncology and rare diseases. Prior to joining CANbridge, she was the Head of Regulatory Affairs at Novartis Oncology China, where she focused on hematology, solid tumors, and rare diseases. Under her leadership, Novartis Oncology secured six New Drug Applications (NDA) from the China FDA (CFDA). Additionally, Ms. Zhang provided regulatory support for the maintenance and growth of 15 oncology products, and grew the team from 5-to-14 people. She was also a key contributor to the Novartis oncology pipeline development and regulatory strategy in China. From 2012-to-2017, Ms. Zhang served on the R&D-based Pharmaceutical Association Committee (RDPAC), a key Chinese pharmaceutical industry association, as Chair of the Orphan Drug Task Force, where she worked closely with the CFDA on regulation development for orphan drugs. In 2015 and 2017, Ms. Zhang was a speaker at China Rare Disease Summit.
Prior to Novartis, Ms. Zhang was Associate Director of Regulatory Affairs at Genzyme China, where she headed the regulatory affairs group and focused on rare diseases. Before then, she worked in regulatory affairs at several companies, including Shanghai Roche and Sanofi China. Ms. Zhang started her career as a researcher in the Department of Pharmaceutical Analysis, National Institutes of Pharmaceutical Research & Development, SFDA. Ms. Zhang holds a MA in Clinical Pharmacology from Hebei Medical University in Shijiazhuang City, China, and a BS in Pharmaceutics from China Pharmaceutical University, in Nanjing, China. She is also a licensed pharmacist.
"Sunny brings to CANbridge considerable experience in guiding oncology and orphan drug candidates through the regulatory process in China," said James Xue, PhD, MBA, CANbridge Chairman, President and CEO. "In many of these cases, she set an unprecedented example in the industry, which, combined with the close working ties she developed with the Chinese regulatory authorities as an expert and advocate on orphan drug and rare disease, makes her the ideal person to head the CANbridge regulatory team at this crucial and exciting juncture."
"I am very excited to join CANbridge, where my passion for cancer and rare disease patients in China aligns with those of CANbridge very well," said Sunny Zhang. "The CANbridge drug development business strategy in China is in accord with the reform that China's health authorities are now pursuing to accelerate the accessibility of innovative drugs to Chinese patients, including those for rare disease patients."
