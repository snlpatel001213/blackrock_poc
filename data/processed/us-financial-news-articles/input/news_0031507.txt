According to a blog article recently published by The Maritime Executive and written by Sri Laxmana, Vice President of Global Ocean Product at C.H. Robinson, global Shipping in 2018 will be relatively similar to 2017, overall. As carriers jockey for market share, there could be rate volatilities. Some shippers will benefit, but service may suffer for others, especially for those who are trying to carry the right amount of inventory and who therefore find it difficult to cope if there are delays.
