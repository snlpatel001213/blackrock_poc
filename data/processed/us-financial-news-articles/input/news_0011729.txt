SAN DIEGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- DexCom, Inc. (Nasdaq: DXCM), the leader in continuous glucose monitoring (“CGM”), today reported that it achieved preliminary, unaudited revenue of approximately $218 million for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2017, an increase of 27% over the fourth quarter of 2016. For fiscal 2017, total preliminary, unaudited revenue is expected to be approximately $715 million, an increase of 25% over 2016.
“We are very pleased with our full year performance, with momentum building as worldwide revenue growth accelerated in the fourth quarter. DexCom also accomplished a number of key milestones during 2017, including a significant increase in international sales, our initial Medicare launch, and the initiation and expansion of a number of key strategic partnerships,” said Kevin Sayer, DexCom’s President and CEO.
2018 Outlook
For 2018, DexCom currently anticipates total revenue of approximately $830 to $850 million. This growth outlook is driven by continued strength in sensor volumes, international revenue and the expansion of DexCom’s worldwide patient base, each of which are expected to exceed its overall revenue growth rate in 2018.
“Our near-term outlook contemplates a number of variables in 2018, including our no-calibration G6 launch and continued expansion into the Medicare and OUS markets, offset by the departure of one of our pump partners and the impact of ongoing competition,” Sayer continued. “We are confident in our team’s ability to execute in the coming quarters and remain bullish on our growth prospects as we advance our priorities.”
Fourth Quarter 2017 Financial Results Conference Call
DexCom will report its audited full fourth quarter and fiscal 2017 financial results on Tuesday, February 27, 2018 after the close of market. Management is currently scheduled to host a conference call at 4:30 p.m. (Eastern Time) that day. More details will be provided later.
