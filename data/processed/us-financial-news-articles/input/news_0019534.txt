Robert Franks set a program record with 10 three-pointers and scored 34 points as Washington State snapped a four-game losing streak with a 78-53 victory over visiting California on Saturday.

Cal (7-11, 1-4) had three freshmen in the starting lineup with Justice Sueing, Darius McNeill and Juhwan Harris-Dyson. The youth should bode well for the future, but the Bears are struggling this season and have lost four consecutive games.
Sueing led his team with 14 points and Harris-Dyson finished with 12. Don Coleman added 10 points for the Golden Bears, who won the rebound battle 40-29.
Washington State led most of the way, and a 3-pointer by Franks provided a 45-34 lead with 15:16 left in the game. Franks, who averages 17.3 points per game, was 11-of-17 from the field.
A dunk by Franks gave the Cougars a 52-43 lead with 10:48 remaining. The Bears struggled to get back in the game and endured a three-minute scoring drought before Harris-Dyson made a free throw with seven minutes left.
This opened the door for the Cougars to continue to pull away. Another 3-pointer by Franks increased the margin to 65-46, and Washington State was not threatened the rest of the way
