Jan 17 (Reuters) - Wall Street’s main indexes were poised to open higher on Wednesday following strong results from Bank of America and a double upgrade on IBM.
BofA shares edged up 0.3 percent in premarket trading after the second-largest U.S. bank reported quarterly profit that beat estimates as it gained from higher interest rates.
However, Goldman Sachs slipped 0.9 percent after posting a quarterly loss due to a $4.4 billion charge related to the new tax law.
“I think it’s very confusing to look at earnings right now because of the tax change charges,” said Rick Meckler, president of hedge fund LibertyView Capital Management LLC in Jersey City, New Jersey.
“Investors are trying to figure out what normalized earnings are in a sort of a new environment for them where interest rates are higher, under changing regulations and the new tax code.”
