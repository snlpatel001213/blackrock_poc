BERLIN, Jan 29 (Reuters) - Twenty-four hour strikes by Germany’s powerful IG Metall union will be highly damaging for companies, employers’ association Gesamtmetall said on Monday, adding that it was seeking a compromise sustainable for both parties. 
“There is major damage given that all companies in the delivery chain are affected,” said Oliver Zander of Gesamtmetall. “Twenty-four hour strikes are irresponsible and threaten jobs.” 
He said employers had at the weekend offered a 6.8 percent wage increase over 27 months. 
“We want a compromise that is sustainable for both sides,” added Zander. Reporting by Klaus Lauer; Writing by Joseph Nasr; Editing by Maria Sheahan
