January 17, 2018 / 5:38 AM / Updated 3 hours ago Tennis - Second seed Wozniacki fights back from the brink   Second seed Caroline Wozniacki saved two match points as she battled back from 5-1 down in the deciding set to beat Melbourne Park debutante Jana Fett 3-6 6-2 7-5 in the second   on Wednesday. 
Former world number one Wozniacki was simply outplayed by the 21-year-old Croatian for large parts of the match but won six straight games to avert the upset and claim her place in the third round. 
Fett, ranked 119th in the world, twice served for the match but nerves got the better of her and Wozniacki tapped all of her experience to take full advantage and set up a meeting with Kiki Bertens or Nicole Gibbs. 
The Dane looked every inch the world number two as she briskly served out the match, claiming victory when Fett dumped a backhand into the net after a shade over two and a half hours in the sun on Rod Laver Arena. Reporting by Nick Mulvenney in Sydney, editing by Peter Rutherford
