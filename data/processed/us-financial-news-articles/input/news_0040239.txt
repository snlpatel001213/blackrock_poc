ANKARA (Reuters) - The Turkish border town of Reyhanli was struck by another missile fired from Syria on Sunday, broadcaster CNN Turk reported, after three rockets hit the town and killed one Syrian national earlier.
There were no immediate reports of casualties, as Turkish ground forces pushed into northern Syriaâ€™s Afrin province after launching artillery and air strikes on a U.S.-backed Kurdish militia it aims to sweep from its border.
