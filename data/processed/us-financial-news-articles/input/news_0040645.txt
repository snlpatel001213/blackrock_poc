BRASILIA, Jan 24 (Reuters) - The first of three Brazilian judges weighing an appeal by former leftist President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva voted on Wednesday to uphold a corruption conviction that will likely sideline him from running in this year’s presidential election. 
Appeals court judge Pedro Gebran dismissed defense lawyers’ arguments that the conviction for receiving a bribe and laundering money lacked proof and was politically motivated. Gebran said the so-called Car Wash investigation suggested Lula was an organizer of the kickback scheme operating within state-run oil company Petroleo Brasileiro SA, funding his Workers Party and its allies.
