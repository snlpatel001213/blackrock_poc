Our direct sales division, Usborne Books & More (“UBAM”), continues to be the largest operating segment of the Company.

Per Mr. White, “As we previously announced, our Company had record net revenues in our fiscal third quarter. These revenues were made possible through the technology and operational improvements that were made this year which increased our daily shipping volumes. Shipments during the quarter were able to keep up with incoming orders without creating a large backlog, which increased revenues and greatly improved customer satisfaction over prior year levels. This also resulted in minimal deferred revenue at the end of the quarter.
"We are also reporting record profits for the quarter. These profits result from increased volumes and operational improvements that were made during the last two years. We are very pleased to see trends in reduced handling, packaging and shipping costs and are excited to see these trends continue in the future.”
Mr. White continued, “We are also continuing to make additional investments in cost reducing technologies. During the fiscal fourth quarter, we will be investing approximately $1,000,000 to bring additional automation into our packaging and fulfilment processes, which will further increase our daily shipping capacity and efficiency.”
