Michal Neuvirth stopped 28 of 29 shots, and the Philadelphia Flyers got goals from three different skaters in a 3-1 victory against the New Jersey Devils in a Saturday matinee at Wells Fargo Center in Philadelphia.
Travis Konecny, Valtteri Filppula and Ivan Provorov each scored a goal in the first 12:15 of the opening period to help the Flyers win their second straight game after Thursday’s 3-2 overtime victory against Toronto.
Philadelphia has now won six of eight games (6-2-0) since the calendar flipped to 2018.
Jesper Bratt netted the only goal for the Devils, who snapped their two-game winning streak.
Keith Kinkaid allowed all three goals and made just seven saves before departing with a lower-body injury in the first for New Jersey. Ken Appleby entered in place of Kinkaid and stopped all 24 shots he faced in his NHL debut.
New Jersey had won back-to-back games after a season-worst six-game skid (0-3-3).
The Flyers also beat the Devils in their first meeting of the season on Jan. 13, with Sean Couturier totaling two goals and an assist in a 5-3 victory in New Jersey.
Konecny got the scoring going with his seventh tally of the season only 3:29 into the first. Filppula doubled the Flyers’ lead with his 10th of the campaign at 8:30 of the period before Provorov’s ninth goal at the 12:15 mark made it 3-0.
Kinkaid was shaken up on the Provorov goal and gave way to the rookie Appleby.
Bratt’s lamp-lighter at 8:12 of the second cut the Devils’ deficit to two goals. Taylor Hall was credited with the secondary assist on Bratt’s goal, extending his points streak to seven games (five goals, seven assists).
New Jersey’s Brian Gibbons exited the game with a hand injury in the second period after blocking a shot on a power play and did not return.
Philadelphia visits the Capitals on Sunday. New Jersey returns home to face Detroit on Monday.
