DUBAI, Jan 15 (Reuters) - First Abu Dhabi Bank, the largest bank in the United Arab Emirates, has issued a $610 million Formosa bond, sources familiar with the matter said on Monday.
Formosa bonds are sold in Taiwan by foreign borrowers and are denominated in currencies other than the Taiwanese dollar.
First Abu Dhabi Bank did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
