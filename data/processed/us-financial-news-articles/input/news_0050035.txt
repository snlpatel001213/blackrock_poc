Air Products (NYSE: APD) today reported GAAP net income from continuing operations of $156 million and GAAP diluted earnings per share (EPS) from continuing operations of $.70, down 38 and 39 percent, respectively from the prior year, for its fiscal first quarter ended December 31, 2017. These results included a net $239 million, or $1.09 per share, charge related to the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ("Tax Act").
For the quarter, on a non-GAAP basis, adjusted net income from continuing operations of $395 million increased 23 percent and diluted adjusted EPS from continuing operations of $1.79 increased 22 percent over prior year. Excluding a $.06 benefit from the new Tax Act, EPS increased 18 percent.
The adjusted EPS benefit from the Tax Act in the first quarter was $.06 per share. Air Products expects the full-year adjusted EPS benefit of the Tax Act to be $0.20 to $0.25 per share, with an expected adjusted full-year tax rate of 20 to 21 percent. Non-GAAP results for the Company in the fiscal first quarter of 2018 exclude a net expense of $239 million due to the Tax Act, which includes an expense of $453 million for the cost of the deemed repatriation tax and adjustments to the future cost of repatriation from foreign investments, and a benefit of $214 million, primarily from the re-measurement of the Company's net U.S. deferred tax liabilities at the lower corporate tax rate. See reconciliation of non-GAAP measures starting on page 4.
First quarter sales of $2.2 billion increased 18 percent from the prior year on 13 percent higher volumes, two percent higher pricing and three percent favorable currency.Volumes were higher in all three Industrial Gas regions, driven by new plants, a contract termination resulting in a plant sale in China, and base business growth.
For the quarter, adjusted EBITDA of $735 million increased 12 percent over the prior year, driven by the higher volumes and Asia pricing. Adjusted EBITDA margin of 33.2 percent decreased 160 basis points from the prior year, primarily driven by the China contract termination/plant sale and higher energy pass-through.
Commenting on the results, Seifi Ghasemi , chairman, president and chief executive officer, said, "The committed and motivated team at Air Products delivered another excellent quarter of safety and financial results. Adjusted EPS of $1.79 was another quarterly record. This is also the 15th consecutive quarter that we have reported adjusted EPS growth. In addition, we are winning new projects and delivering on our growth strategy. We generated a significant amount of investable cash and announced a 16 percent increase to our quarterly dividend, making our annual dividend $4.40 per share."
First Quarter Results by Business Segment
Industrial Gases – Americas sales of $910 million increased five percent over prior year, driven by higher volumes, primarily strong hydrogen demand. Adjusted EBITDA of $354 million increased one percent over the prior year, with higher volumes more than offsetting costs from higher planned maintenance outages. Adjusted EBITDA margin of 38.9 percent decreased 160 basis points from the prior year. Industrial Gases – EMEA sales of $516 million increased 29 percent over prior year, driven by 17 percent higher volumes, as well as nine percent favorable currency and three percent favorable energy pass through. The higher volumes were primarily from a new hydrogen plant in India; merchant volumes were also positive. Adjusted EBITDA of $167 million increased 18 percent over the prior year, primarily driven by the volume increase and the positive currency impact. Adjusted EBITDA margin of 32.3 percent decreased 320 basis points from the prior year; excluding the impact of higher energy pass through and high natural gas prices in India, margins were roughly flat. Industrial Gases – Asia sales of $644 million increased 47 percent over prior year, mainly due to the contract termination/plant sale in China; excluding this, volumes were up eight percent from both new plants and strong base merchant business. Pricing increased seven percent over prior year, driven by China merchant pricing. Adjusted EBITDA of $247 million increased 38 percent from the contract termination and plant sale, strong volumes, higher pricing and favorable currency. Excluding the contract termination/plant sale, adjusted EBITDA margins increased 240 basis points.
Outlook
Ghasemi said, "We continue to be optimistic about the future of Air Products. We cannot predict, and do not have control, over worldwide political or economic developments. But we do have control over the operational and growth performance of Air Products, and we feel confident we can deliver on our goals. We have a strong balance sheet – the best in the industry. We will continue to focus on safety, controlling our costs, and investing in the many strategic growth opportunities we see."
Air Products expects fiscal 2018 adjusted EPS of $7.15 to $7.35 per share, up 13 to 16 percent over prior year, including an estimated $0.20 to $0.25 benefit from the Tax Act. For the fiscal 2018 second quarter, Air Products expects adjusted EPS of $1.65 to $1.70 per share, up 15 to 19 percent over the fiscal 2017 second quarter, including an estimated $0.05 benefit from the Tax Act. This guidance excludes the Lu'An project and any other significant future acquisitions.
The capital expenditure forecast for fiscal year 2018 is expected to be in the range of $1.2 to $1.4 billion on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. This guidance excludes Lu'An and any other significant future acquisitions.
The Company adopted accounting guidance in the first quarter which revised the reporting of pension and postretirement expense to reclassify non-service costs from operating costs to non-operating income/expense. There is no impact to reported EPS. See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for more details.
Management has provided adjusted EPS and adjusted tax rate guidance on a continuing operations basis. While Air Products might have additional impacts from the Tax Act or incur additional costs for items such as cost reduction actions and pension settlements in future periods, it is not possible, without unreasonable efforts, to identify the amount or significance of these events or the potential for other transactions that may impact future GAAP EPS or the effective tax rate. Management does not believe these items to be representative of underlying business performance. Accordingly, management is unable to reconcile, without unreasonable effort, the Company's forecasted range of adjusted EPS or the impact of the adjusted tax rate to a comparable GAAP range.

RECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
(Millions of dollars unless otherwise indicated, except for share data)
The Company has presented certain financial measures on a non-GAAP ("adjusted") basis and has provided a reconciliation to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP. These financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP. The Company believes these non-GAAP measures provide investors, potential investors, securities analysts, and others with useful information to evaluate the performance of the business because such measures, when viewed together with our financial results computed in accordance with GAAP, provide a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting our historical financial performance and projected future results.
In many cases, our non-GAAP measures are determined by adjusting the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure to exclude certain disclosed items ("non-GAAP adjustments") that we believe are not representative of the underlying business performance. For example, Air Products restructured the Company to focus on its core Industrial Gases business. This had resulted in significant cost reduction and asset actions that we believe were important for investors to understand separately from the performance of the underlying business. The reader should be aware that we may incur similar expenses in the future. The tax impact on our pre-tax non-GAAP adjustments reflects the expected current and deferred income tax expense impact of the transactions and is impacted primarily by the statutory tax rate of the various relevant jurisdictions and the taxability of the adjustments in those jurisdictions. Investors should also consider the limitations associated with these non-GAAP measures, including the potential lack of comparability of these measures from one company to another.
During the first quarter of fiscal year 2018, we adopted accounting guidance on the presentation of net periodic pension and postretirement benefit cost. Certain prior year information has been reclassified to conform to the fiscal year 2018 presentation. Refer to Note 2, New Accounting Guidance, for additional information.

ADJUSTED EBITDA
We define Adjusted EBITDA as income from continuing operations (including noncontrolling interests) excluding certain disclosed items, which the Company does not believe to be indicative of underlying business trends, before interest expense, other non‑operating income (expense), net, income tax provision (benefit), and depreciation and amortization expense. Adjusted EBITDA provides a useful metric for management to assess operating performance.

CAPITAL EXPENDITURES
We utilize a non-GAAP measure in the computation of capital expenditures and include spending associated with facilities accounted for as capital leases. Certain contracts associated with facilities that are built to provide product to a specific customer are required to be accounted for as leases, and such spending is reflected as a use of cash in the consolidated statements of cash flows within "Cash Provided by Operating Activities" if the arrangement qualifies as a capital lease.

RETURN ON CAPITAL EMPLOYED (ROCE)
Return on capital employed (ROCE) is calculated on a continuing operations basis as earnings after-tax divided by five-quarter average total capital. Earnings after-tax is calculated based on trailing four quarters and is defined as the sum of net income from continuing operations attributable to Air Products, interest expense, after-tax, at our effective quarterly tax rate, and net income attributable to noncontrolling interests. This non-GAAP measure has been adjusted for the impact of the disclosed items detailed below. Total capital consists of total debt and total equity less noncontrolling interests and total assets of discontinued operations.

OUTLOOK
Guidance provided is on a non-GAAP continuing operations basis, which excludes the impact of certain items that we believe are not representative of our underlying business performance. While we might incur additional costs for items such as cost reduction actions and pension settlements in future periods, it is not possible, without unreasonable efforts, to identify the amount or significance of these events or the potential for other transactions that may impact future GAAP EPS. Accordingly, management is unable to reconcile, without unreasonable effort, the Company's forecasted range of adjusted EPS on a continuing operations basis to a comparable GAAP range.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Unaudited)
(Millions of dollars, unless otherwise indicated)
1. INCOME TAXES
On 22 December 2017, the United States enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ("the Act") which significantly changed existing U.S. tax laws, including a reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, a deemed repatriation tax on unremitted foreign earnings, as well as other changes. As a result of the Act, our consolidated income statements reflect a net expense of $239.0 in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018. This includes an expense of $453.0 for the cost of the deemed repatriation tax and adjustments to the future cost of repatriation from foreign investments. This expense impacted our income tax provision by $420.5 and equity affiliate income by $32.5 for future costs of repatriation that will be borne by an equity affiliate. In addition, the income tax provision was benefited by $214.0 primarily from the re-measurement of our net U.S. deferred tax liabilities at the lower corporate tax rate.
We are reporting the impacts of the Act provisionally based upon reasonable estimates. The impacts are not yet finalized as they are dependent on factors and analysis not yet known or fully completed, including but not limited to, the final cash balances for fiscal year 2018, further book to U.S. tax adjustments for the earnings of foreign entities, the issuance of additional guidance, as well as our ongoing analysis of the Act.
As a fiscal year-end taxpayer, certain provisions of the Act become effective in our fiscal year 2018 while other provisions do not become effective until fiscal year 2019. The corporate tax rate reduction is effective as of 1 January 2018 and, accordingly, reduces our 2018 fiscal year U.S. federal statutory rate to a blended rate of approximately 24.5%.
2. NEW ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE
Presentation of Net Periodic Pension and Postretirement Benefit Cost
During the first quarter of fiscal year 2018, we adopted accounting guidance on the presentation of net periodic pension and postretirement benefit cost. Prior to adoption, all net periodic benefit costs were presented within operating costs, primarily within "Cost of sales" and "Selling and administrative." As a result of adoption, non-service costs (e.g., interest cost, expected return on plan assets, amortization of actuarial gains/losses, settlements) are now presented in our consolidated income statements outside of operating income in "Other non-operating income (expense), net." Prior period information has been reclassified to conform to the fiscal year 2018 presentation. The line item classification changes required by the new guidance did not impact the Company's pre-tax earnings or net income; however, "Operating income" and "Other non-operating income (expense), net" changed by immaterial offsetting amounts.
