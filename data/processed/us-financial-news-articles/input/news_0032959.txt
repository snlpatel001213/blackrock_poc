WASHINGTON, Jan 18 (Reuters) - Republican U.S. Senator Mike Rounds said he would not vote for a measure to temporarily fund the government and avoid a government shutdown this week, citing concerns about defense spending and Congress’ inability to pass budgets on time.
“I‘m opposing the CR (continuing resolution) in its current form,” Rounds told CNN in an interview on Thursday. (Reporting by Susan Heavey)
