There was widespread local media speculation this week that Zuma’s opponents in the ANC’s newly elected 80-member national executive committee would raise a motion of no-confidence at its first meeting under new party leader Cyril Ramaphosa. 
Magashule told reporters following the meeting that the only item on the agenda was the statement to be read by Ramaphosa on Jan. 8 to mark the 106th birthday of the ANC. Reporting by Ed Stoddard; Writing by Joe Brock; Editing by Robin Pomeroy
