(Replaces analyst comment; updates prices) BEIJING, Jan 26 (Reuters) - Base metal prices on Friday edged down from near multi-year peaks after U.S. President Donald Trump backed a stronger dollar, prompting the currency to trade above its recent lows. A stronger dollar makes metals more expensive for holders of other currencies. The greenback's recent weakness saw lead on the London Metal Exchange touch $2,653 a tonne on Thursday, highest since August 2011, while zinc hit a decade high of $3,481.50, and nickel its highest since May 2015. Trump's comments on the U.S. currency contradicted U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin's earlier endorsement of a weak dollar. "As far as the metals are concerned it would seem that the mainly Mnuchin-inspired reason for the rally has been if not reversed certainly modified and as a result the ever-nervous markets lost and may yet lose further ground," Malcolm Freeman, CEO of Kingdom Futures, wrote in a note on Friday.
