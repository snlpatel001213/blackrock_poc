NEW YORK (Reuters) - Commodities trading house Trafigura said on Tuesday it signed a new agreement with Plains All American Pipeline to transport 300,000 barrels of crude oil per day from the Permian basin to the port of Corpus Christi, in a move aimed at boosting exports.
Trafigura said it would transport the oil via the Cactus II Pipeline, which is targeted for service in the third-quarter of 2019.
