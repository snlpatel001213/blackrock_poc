ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkey’s military operation against a U.S.-backed Kurdish militia in Syria’s Afrin region will have a very limited impact on the Turkish economy and budget, Deputy Prime Minister Mehmet Simsek said on Monday. 
“Our investors should be at ease, the impact will be limited, the operation will be brief and it will reduce the terror risk to Turkey in the period ahead,” Simsek said at a ceremony in Ankara. Reporting by Nevzat Devranoglu; Writing by Daren Butler; Editing by David Dolan
