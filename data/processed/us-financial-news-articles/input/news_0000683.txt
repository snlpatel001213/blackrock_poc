The Treasury announced new sanctions Thursday on five Iranian entities affiliated with the country's ballistic missile program.

All five Iranian entities are subordinates of the Iranian company Shahid Bakeri Industrial Group. 
The new restrictions will prevent the entities from dealing financially with U.S. citizens and financial institutions. 

The announcement comes as tens of thousands of Iranians have taken to the streets , including in the nation's capital of Tehran, to protest the government.
