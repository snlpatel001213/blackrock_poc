SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Tianjin Tianhai Investment Co Ltd ( 600751.SS ), a unit of Chinese aviation and shipping conglomerate HNA Group [HNAIRC.UL], said on Sunday that media reports that the firm planned to sell Ingram Micro were false. 
The firm said the company was not involved in a situation as described by Chinese media reports, which said Tianjin Tianhai was looking to sell its U.S. electronics distributor subsidiary, Ingram Micro Inc, to Synnex Corp ( SNX.N ). 
“Ingram Micro is an important, strategic investment project to the company and is a key cornerstone and asset to the company’s transformation and development,” it said in a statement to the Shanghai Stock Exchange. 
It said that Ingram Micro’s operating income in the third quarter grew 10.79 percent year-on-year and net profits rose 6.14 percent over the same period. 
Tianjin Tianhai bought Ingram Micro last year for about $6 billion. The company on Friday halted share trading and said that it planned to disclose a “major plan”. Reporting by Brenda Goh, editing by Louise Heavens
