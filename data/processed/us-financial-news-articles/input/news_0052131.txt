(NASDAQ-GS: TROW) today reported its fourth quarter of 2017 results, including net revenues of $1.3 billion, net income of $347.1 million, and diluted earnings per common share of $1.37. For the fourth quarter of 2016, net revenues were $1.1 billion, net income was $379.8 million, and diluted earnings per common share was $1.50. On a non-GAAP basis, diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $1.52, compared with $1.21 in the 2016 quarter.
Financial Highlights
The table below presents financial results on a U.S. GAAP basis as well as a non-GAAP basis that adjusts for the impact of the Dell appraisal rights matter, the consolidated T. Rowe Price investment products, the supplemental savings plan, other non-operating income, and the non-recurring charge recognized in 2017 related to the enactment of U.S. tax reform. The firm believes the non-GAAP financial measures below provide relevant and meaningful information to investors about its core operating results.

The firm's common shares outstanding were 245.1 million at December 31, 2017, compared with 244.8 million at December 31, 2016, as the firm issued more shares from the exercise and vesting of equity awards than the firm repurchased in 2017. The firm expended $458.1 million in 2017 to repurchase 6.6 million shares, or 2.7%, of its outstanding common shares, including $1.4 million to repurchase 15,000 shares during the fourth quarter of 2017. The firm invested $186.1 million during 2017 in capitalized facilities and technology, and expects capital expenditures for 2018 to be about $180 million, of which about two-thirds is planned for technology initiatives. These expenditures are expected to continue to be funded from operating resources.

Financial Results
Investment advisory revenues earned in the current quarter from the T. Rowe Price U.S. mutual funds were $817.9 million, an increase of 16.7% from the comparable 2016 quarter. Average assets under management in these funds increased 17.1% to $600.6 billion.
Investment advisory revenues earned in the current quarter from other investment products were $338.1 million, an increase of 27.1% from the comparable 2016 quarter. Average assets under management for these products increased 27.5% to $375.8 billion.
Operating expenses were $755.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared with $527.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. The fourth quarter of 2016 operating expenses were reduced by the recognition of the $100 million insurance recovery related to the Dell appraisal rights matter. For the year, operating expenses were $2,684.2 million in 2017 compared with $2,489.5 million in 2016. On a non-GAAP basis, the firm's operating expenses in the fourth quarter of 2017 increased 19.4% to $747.7 million, and for the year increased 12.4% to $2,715.8 million. This 12.4% increase was primarily due to market driven expenses and continued strategic spend in light of strong markets and early successes of the firm's investments.
The firm currently expects 2018 non-GAAP operating expense growth to lessen relative to 2017, even as growth in market driven expenses and investments in the business continue. However, the firm could elect to adjust its expense growth should markets increase or decline significantly. In addition, other events not currently planned or expected could impact the firm's expense level in 2018. The firm is carefully evaluating the impact the U.S. tax reform will have on the firm, and factoring in the potential investment, operating expense, and capital management implications.
Compensation and related costs were $446.3 million in the current quarter, an increase of 17.0% over the fourth quarter of 2016, due primarily to additional headcount, an increase in the interim accrual of the annual bonus to reward strong performance, and higher benefits. Higher benefit expenses primarily relate to an increase in health care costs, greater payroll taxes resulting from the impact the firm's higher stock price had on equity based awards, and additional compensation expense related to the supplemental savings plan as stronger equity markets have increased the liability. Average staff size increased by 9.0% from the fourth quarter of 2016, and the firm employed 6,881 associates at December 31, 2017, an increase of 552 associates from the end of 2016.
Advertising and promotion costs were $33.8 million in the current quarter, an increase of 24.3% over the fourth quarter of 2016. For the full year, advertising and promotion costs increased 15.1% over the 2016 year. The firm increased its spend in 2017 in support of efforts to broaden its distribution reach and in response to investor sentiment and the strong market environment.
Occupancy and facility costs, together with depreciation expense, were $90.4 million in the current quarter, an increase of 14.9% compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase is due primarily to added costs to update and enhance technology capabilities, including related maintenance programs, as well as expanded office facilities and new locations.
Other operating expenses were $146.6 million in the current quarter, an increase of 39.8% from the comparable 2016 quarter. The increase was a result of the firm's investment in its strategic initiatives, higher distribution and client servicing costs driven by the strong market performance, and other growing operational and regulatory business demands.
Net non-operating income was $102.0 million in the current quarter, an increase of $89.8 million from the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase was driven primarily by higher investment income resulting from the strong market performance in 2017. The components of net non-operating income for the quarters as well as the full-years ended December 31, 2016 and 2017 are included in the tables at the back of this release.
The firm's income tax provision for the fourth quarter of 2017 includes a non-recurring charge of $71.1 million to reflect the estimated effect of the U.S. tax law changes enacted on December 22, 2017. The recognized charge is based on current interpretation of the tax law changes, and includes $18.9 million for the remeasurement of the firm's deferred tax assets and liabilities, and a $52.2 million tax liability for the mandatory deemed repatriation of foreign sourced net earnings. The increase in the firm's 2017 effective tax rate resulting from this charge was offset in part by higher than expected tax benefits related to the exercise of stock options, vesting of restricted stock, and net income attributable to redeemable non-controlling interests, which is not taxable to the firm. The following reconciles the statutory federal income tax rate to the firm's effective tax rate for the full-year 2017:

The firm estimates that the reduction in the U.S. corporate tax rate (from 35% to 21%) in 2018, combined with other miscellaneous tax changes that effect certain tax deductions, will reduce its 2018 effective tax rate to a range of 24.0% to 27.0%.
Management Commentary
William J. Stromberg, the company's president and chief executive officer, commented: "Capping a year of strong gains, U.S. stocks again rose in the fourth quarter, pushing most major indexes further into record territory. Led by emerging markets, international stocks continued their strong run, outperforming U.S. shares in 2017. In global fixed income markets, non-U.S., emerging markets, and high yield debt led the way for the quarter and year, supported by solid credit fundamentals.
"This was a very good quarter and year for T. Rowe Price, our clients, and our stockholders. Strong relative investment performance, robust markets, and healthy client activity boosted our assets under management by 22% in 2017, including 5% in the fourth quarter. Reflecting increased demand for our approach to active management, and our success in broadening our product offerings and distribution capabilities, our net flows and organic growth reached their highest annual levels since 2012. The strength of our core business and early success of our strategic efforts also is reflected in the diversity of these flows across geographies and asset classes, including positive flows for our international equity, fixed income, and multi-asset strategies.
"As we continue to advance our strategic priorities, we are encouraged by the progress we are making to add new capabilities and by the significant client interest we are experiencing. Recent highlights include:
Multi-Asset Investing - On the continued strength of investment performance, T. Rowe Price remains a leader in the active target date space. We have more than doubled the size of our dedicated multi-asset investment professional staff in the past two years and in 2017 further built out our solutions capabilities with several senior hires across the globe. We also remain on track for several upcoming product launches. U.S. Intermediary and Institutional Distribution - We continued to extend our leadership position with U.S. intermediaries and saw the early impact of last year's 20% expansion in the number of client-facing associates in this area. Flows through no transaction fee platforms remained strong and diverse across asset classes. We planted the seeds for future managed accounts activity by adding three more equity strategies to our model portfolio and retail separately managed account lineups. On the institutional side, we saw continued growth in our DCIO business, also supported by an expansion of client-facing resources. EMEA and Asia Pacific Distribution - The extension of our vehicle lineups continue, and we have expanded our local distribution resources. This has contributed to new and expanded client engagements, including the launch of two multi-asset Target Income funds in partnership with a key client in South Korea. Client Experience and Technology - Work is advancing in our Maryland Innovation Center to use technology and agile processes to accelerate delivery of redesigned and improved digital client experiences for individual investors and retirement plan participants. We saw initial success with these initiatives in 2017, and plan to expand these efforts in 2018. This work complements our progress in leveraging advanced analytics and machine learning to enhance customer segmentation and augment our investment process.
"We are confident that the hard work of our associates will enable us to be competitive and continue to grow and diversify the company on a global basis. We are well positioned to invest for the future and to create additional long-term value for our clients and our stockholders."

Non-GAAP Information and Reconciliation
The firm believes the non-GAAP financial measures below provide relevant and meaningful information to investors about its core operating results. These measures have been established in order to increase transparency for the purpose of evaluating the firm's core business, for comparing current results with prior period results, and to enable more appropriate comparison with industry peers. However, non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as a substitute for financial measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may be calculated differently by other companies. The following schedule (in millions, except for per-share amounts) reconciles U.S. GAAP financial measures to non-GAAP measures for the three months and year ended December 31, 2016 and 2017.

The non-GAAP adjustments add back the management fees that the firm earns from the consolidated T. Rowe Price investment products and subtract the investment income and operating expenses of these products that have been included in the firm's U.S. GAAP consolidated statements of income. Management believes the consolidated T. Rowe Price investment products may impact the reader's ability to understand the firm's core operating results. The following table details the calculation of net income of consolidated T. Rowe Price investment products, net of redeemable non-controlling interests:

This non-GAAP adjustment removes the impact of market movements on the supplemental savings plan liability and related investments designated as economic hedges of the liability beginning July 1, 2017. Amounts deferred under the supplemental savings plan are adjusted for appreciation (depreciation) of hypothetical investments chosen by the employees. Since the firm economically hedges the exposure to these market movements, management believes it is useful to offset the non-operating investment income earned on the hedges against the related compensation expense to increase comparability period to period. The following table details the supplemental savings plan related items:

This non-GAAP adjustment removes the non-operating income that remains after eliminating the portion related to the consolidated T. Rowe Price investment products and investments designated as an economic hedge of the firm's supplemental savings plan liability. Management believes excluding non-operating income helps the reader's ability to understand the firm's core operating results and increases comparability to prior years. Additionally, management does not emphasize the impact of non-operating income when managing the firm and evaluating its performance. The following table details the calculation of other non-operating income:

In the second quarter of 2016, the firm recognized a nonrecurring charge of $166.2 million related to the firm's decision to compensate certain clients in regard to the Dell appraisal rights matter. The firm also recognized an offset to this charge during the fourth quarter of 2016 for related insurance recoveries totaling $100 million. In the first quarter of 2017, the firm recognized additional insurance recoveries of $50 million as a reduction in operating expenses from claims that were filed in relation to the matter. Management believes it is useful to readers of the firm's consolidated statements of income to adjust for these charges and non-recurring insurance recoveries in arriving at adjusted operating expenses and net income attributable to T. Rowe Price Group and diluted earnings per share.
(5)
These were calculated using the effective tax rate applicable to each non-GAAP adjustment before tax reform.
(6)
In the fourth quarter of 2017, the firm recognized a nonrecurring charge of $71.1 million to reflect the effect of the U.S. tax law changes enacted on December 22, 2017. Management believes it is useful to readers of the firm's consolidated statements of income to adjust for this nonrecurring charge in arriving at net income attributable to T. Rowe Price Group and diluted earnings per share.
(7)
This non-GAAP measure was calculated by applying the two-class method to adjusted net income attributable to T. Rowe Price Group divided by the weighted-average common shares outstanding assuming dilution.
