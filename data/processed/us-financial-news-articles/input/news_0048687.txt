MORNING CALL: NO DIRECTION TREND YET FOR EUROPEAN SHARES (0621 GMT)
Good morning and welcome to Live Markets. No clear direction is emerging yet for European shares ahead of the ECB’s governing council meeting later today, which will be under intense scrutiny after a rapidly strengthening euro versus a faltering dollar rattled the continent’s bourses during the previous session.
Financial spreadbetters expect London’s FTSE to open 2 points lower at 7641.6 points, Frankfurt’s DAX to open 16 points higher at 13430.5 point and Paris’ CAC to open 1 point higher at 5496 points.
