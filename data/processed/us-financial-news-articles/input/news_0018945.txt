NEW YORK, Jan. 12, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Tripp Levy PLLC, a leading national securities and shareholder rights law firm, announces that it is investigating the potential sale of ZAIS Group Holdings, Inc.(NASDAQ: ZAIS)) ("ZAIS" or the "Company") on behalf of its shareholders. ZAIS announced that it has entered into a definitive agreement to be acquired by Christian Zugel, the Company's Chairman and Chief Investment Officer. Mr. Zugel will acquire the Company for only $4.10 per share in cash.
Our investigation has determined that the offer price of only $4.10 per share, unfairly under-values the true going forward inherent value of ZAIS and that shareholders may not be receiving the maximum value for their shares. Indeed, the stock reached a high of $5.18 per share this year. The investigation further seeks to determine whether ZAIS's senior management is entering into this deal for their own self-interests to the detriment of the Company's shareholders.
If you are a shareholder of ZAIS and would like additional information as to how the proposed acquisition may affect your rights as a shareholder, and how you may be eligible to obtain a higher price for your shares at no cost, please contact us at:
