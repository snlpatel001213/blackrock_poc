MADRID, Jan 9 (Reuters) - Spain’s second-biggest bank BBVA on Tuesday night said it would take a hit of 1.123 billion euros ($1.34 billion) on its 2017 results due to the decline in share price of its 5 percent stake in Telefonica SA . 
The Spanish lender said the writedown on its Telefonica stake would not have an impact on its total CET-1 core capital ratio. It also said it would not generate any cash outflow nor have an impact on dividends. $1 = 0.8377 euros Reporting by Jesús Aguado; Editing by Lisa Shumaker
