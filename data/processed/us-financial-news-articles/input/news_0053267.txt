Sales (-0.6%) and core operating profit (-8.8%) decreased due to the impact of certain items such as the transfer of the global dermatology business in April 2016 and the transfer of long-listed products in Japan in April 2017. Excluding these items, as well as the impact of foreign exchange, sales decreased -1.3% and core operating profit -2.6%, respectively. Sales of key global products such as XTANDI ® for the treatment of prostate cancer and Betanis ® / Myrbetriq ® / BETMIGA ® for the treatment of overactive bladder (“OAB”) grew. Operating profit (-22.3%) and profit for the period (-20.2%) on a full basis decreased mainly due to the impact of one-time impairment losses and charges associated with the review of development project plans and the wind-down of research operations of subsidiary Agensys, Inc. being recorded during the first six months of FY2017.
