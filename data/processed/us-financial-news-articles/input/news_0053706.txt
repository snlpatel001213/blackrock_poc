Jan 29 (Reuters) - Indian telecoms carrier Reliance Communications Ltd reported a narrower quarterly net loss of 1.30 billion rupees ($20.45 million) on Monday.
RCom is selling most of its wireless assets to carrier Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd to raise funds to repay billions of dollars it owes to a clutch of banks.
The loss for the three months ended Dec. 31 was RComâ€™s fifth straight quarterly loss but smaller than the net loss of 5.31 billion rupees it reported a year earlier.
Revenue from operations fell 31.7 percent to 11.44 billion rupees.
