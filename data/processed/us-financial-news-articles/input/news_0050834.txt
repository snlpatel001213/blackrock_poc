January 30, 2018 / 9:23 PM / Updated 5 minutes ago Trump administration drops Cha as pick for Seoul envoy: U.S. official Reuters Staff 1 Min   Victor Cha, a former White House official who had been the Trump’s administration’s choice to be the next U.S. ambassador to South Korea, is no longer being considered for the post, a U.S. official said on Tuesday. 
The Washington Post earlier quoted people familiar with the matter as saying that Cha had raised concerns with National Security Council officials over their consideration of a limited strike on North Korea and about the administration’s threats to tear up a bilateral trade deal with Seoul. 
Cha, a Washington-based academic who for months had been widely expected to be nominated for the sensitive diplomatic post, did not immediately respond to an email requesting comment. Reporting by Matt Spetalnick and David Brunnstrom; Editing by James Dalgleish
