In 2017, The Fall cancelled shows due to concerns over the health of Smith who underwent treatment, media reports said. 
Smith formed the band in 1976 and remained its only constant presence with many other members changing around him. 
Smith also released two solo albums - 'The Post Nearly Man' in 1998 and 'Pander! Panda! Panzer!' in 2002. He is described as a "singular figure in post-punk" by Rolling Stone magazine. rol.st/2n9b93R Reporting by Kanishka Singh; Editing by Matthew Mpoke Bigg
