SYDNEY (Reuters) - Bitcoin had lost a quarter of its value in early Asian trading on Wednesday as fears grew of a regulatory crackdown after reports that South Koreaâ€™s finance minister said banning trading in cryptocurrencies was still an option.
Bitcoin was last down 25 percent at $10,182.00 on the Luxembourg-based Bitstamp exchange.
