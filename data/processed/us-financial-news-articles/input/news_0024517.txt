SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korean refiner Hyundai Oilbank Co Ltd has picked six banks to advise a planned initial public offering (IPO) of at least $1 billion in 2018, IFR reported on Friday, citing people familiar with the situation.
The lead banks advising the IPO are Hana Daetoo Securities and NH Investment & Securities, while joint lead managers are Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Citigroup, Shinhan and Mirae Asset Daewoo Securities, according to IFR, a Thomson Reuters publication.
One of the people said the size of the fundraising could be as high as $2 billion, depending on the valuation, IFR reported.
Hyundai Oilbank, South Korea’s smallest refiner by capacity, and parent Hyundai Robotics ( 267250.KS ) declined to comment.
Hyundai Robotics owns 91 percent of Hyundai Oilbank.
Hyundai Heavy Industries ( 009540.KS ), the flagship company of South Korea’s ninth-largest conglomerate, said in December that Hyundai Robotics, the group’s holding company, had decided to list refining subsidiary Hyundai Oilbank in the second half of 2018.
