MONTREAL (Reuters) - A Canadian jury on Tuesday said it was at an impasse in the trial of three former rail employees in the 2013 Lac Megantic train derailment that killed 47 in Quebec and has asked the judge for guidance in the matter, local media reported. 
In July 2013, the downtown section of the town of Lac Megantic was destroyed following the derailment of a Montreal Maine & Atlantic Railway Ltd. train carrying Bakken crude oil. 
Locomotive engineer Tom Harding, 56, operations manager Jean Dema√Ætre, 53, and rail traffic controller Richard Labrie, 59, face charges of criminal negligence causing death in the crude-by-rail disaster. 
The three worked for the now-defunct Montreal Maine & Atlantic railway which operated the runaway train, according to court documents. 
All three pleaded not guilty and did not testify during the trial in Sherbrooke, Quebec. Reporting By Allison Lampert; Editing by Sandra Maler
