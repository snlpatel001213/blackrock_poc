LONDON (Reuters) - The crew of a British Airways flight from Bangkok to London requested a priority landing as the plane approached Heathrow airport on Tuesday due to an unwell passenger, the airline said. 
The plane, a Boeing 777-236, landed shortly afterwards. 
“That’s now landed safely,” a BA spokeswoman said.
