NEW YORK, Jan. 25, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Notice is hereby given that Monteverde & Associates PC has filed a class action lawsuit in the United States Central District Court of Maryland, case no. 8:18-cv-00173, on behalf of stockholders of Sucampo Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ("Sucampo" or the "Company") (NASDAQ: SCMP ) who held Sucampo securities and have been harmed by Guidance and its board of directors' (the "Board") for alleged violations of Sections 14(d)(4), 14(e), and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act") in connection with the tender offer of Company common stock to be purchased by Mallinckrodt plc ("Mallinckrodt").
Under the terms of the agreement, Sucampo stockholders are only anticipated to receive $18.00 per share in cash in exchange for each share of Sucampo. The complaint alleges that this offer is inadequate and alleges that the Schedule 14D-9 Solicitation/Recommendation Statement (the "Recommendation Statement") provides materially incomplete and misleading information concerning: (i) financial projections for the Company; and (ii) the valuation analyses performed by the Company's financial advisor, Jefferies LLC ("Jefferies"), in support of their fairness opinions.
If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than 60 days from today. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member.
