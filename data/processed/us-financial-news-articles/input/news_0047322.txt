WARSAW, Jan 25 (Reuters) - PKN Orlen, Polandâ€™s top oil refiner, said on Thursday fourth-quarter net profit fell by 11 percent year-on-year to 1.59 billion zlotys ($477.42 million) as higher oil prices hit its refining margins. 
Analysts had expected the state-run PKN Orlen to report a net profit of 1.72 billion zlotys in the fourth quarter compared with 1.79 billion zlotys a year ago, when refinery shutdowns weighed on the results. $1 = 3.3304 zlotys Reporting by Anna Koper; Writing by Marcin Goclowski and Agnieszka Barteczko, Editing by Sherry Jacob-Phillips
