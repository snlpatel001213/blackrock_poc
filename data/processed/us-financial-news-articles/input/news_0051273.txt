SAN FRANCISCO, Jan. 26, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Prologis, Inc. (NYSE: PLD), the global leader in logistics real estate, today announced the tax treatment of its 2017 distributions. While the distributions generally resulted in approximately 70% ordinary income and 30% capital gains, exhibits A and B reflect the tax treatment of distributions as prescribed by the Internal Revenue Code on Prologis, Inc. common and preferred stock, respectively.
Persons who held shares of common stock of Prologis, Inc. in their name at any time during 2017 will receive an IRS Form 1099-DIV via Computershare, Prologis' transfer agent. Persons who held shares in "street name" during 2017 should note that the IRS form provided by a bank, brokerage firm or nominee may report only gross distributions. Therefore, the information herein may be needed to properly complete a federal tax return.
This information has been prepared using the best available information to date. Prologis, Inc.'s federal income tax return for the year ended December 31, 2017 has not yet been filed. Please note that federal tax laws affect taxpayers differently, and we cannot advise on how distributions should be reported. Please also note that state and local taxation of REIT distributions may differ from federal rules. Prologis, Inc. recommends a consultation with a tax advisor regarding the federal, state and local income tax consequences of these distributions.
