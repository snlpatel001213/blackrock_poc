Net Income
The Company’s updated 2017 Net Income guidance includes incurred costs of approximately $0.51 per diluted share associated with the merger of Regency and Equity One, Inc. No additional costs are anticipated in 2018. 2018 Net Income is expected to be $1.47 to $1.56 per diluted share.
NAREIT FFO
The Company’s updated 2017 NAREIT FFO guidance includes incurred costs of approximately $0.51 per diluted share associated with the merger of Regency and Equity One, Inc. No additional transaction costs are anticipated in 2018. The increase in 2017 NAREIT FFO compared to previous guidance is primarily attributed to recognizing the tax benefit from adjustment to the deferred tax liability balances in the Company’s taxable REIT subsidiaries as a result of the recent tax law changes. 2018 NAREIT FFO is expected to be $3.73 to $3.82 per diluted share.
Core FFO and Introduction of Operating FFO
2017 Core FFO is now expected to be in the range of $3.68 to $3.70 per diluted share. The Company expects 2018 Core FFO to be $3.76 to $3.83 per diluted share.
In 2017, Regency completed its merger with Equity One. Due to purchase accounting adjustments required with the merger under Accounting Standards Codification 805, specifically related to the requirement to mark-to-market all Equity One leases or approximately 35% of Regency’s total rent, non-cash accounting adjustments will have a disproportionate impact on earnings. Regency management operates its business and makes financial decisions based upon earnings before the impact of these non-cash accounting adjustments. Therefore, Regency is introducing Operating Funds From Operations (“Operating FFO”), an earnings metric used by the Company to measure earnings growth.
Operating FFO will continue to exclude certain non-comparable items that affect the Company’s period-over-period performance consistent with the existing definition of Core FFO. The non-cash items that will be excluded from NAREIT FFO in the determination of Operating FFO are amortization of above and below market rent, straight-line rent and amortization of mark-to-market debt adjustments. The Company will provide guidance on Operating FFO on a go-forward basis. 2018 Operating FFO is expected to be $3.48 to $3.54 per diluted share.
Additional detail including a 2018 roll forward of Core FFO, a reconciliation of Operating FFO, and an Operating FFO historical lookback is provided in the guidance supplemental package on the Company’s website.
