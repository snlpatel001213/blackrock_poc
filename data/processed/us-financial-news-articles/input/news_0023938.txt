 British ministers are “very worried” about contractor Interserve and have set up a team of officials to monitor the company, following the collapse of competitor Carillion, the Financial Times reported on Wednesday.
The Financial Times said that civil servants had monitored Interserve since a profit warning in September due to concerns over its financial health, citing government advisers and officials.
Interserve declined to comment on the report. (Reporting by Alistair Smout; editing by Guy Faulconbridge)
