SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Shares in Brazilian wood pulp producer Fibria Celulose SA ( FIBR3.SA ) rose 7.6 percent in early Monday trading on a report that Netherlands-based Paper Excellence was considering acquiring it.
Paper Excellence, which is controlled by the owners of Indonesiaâ€™s Asia Pulp & Paper Co Ltd, has hired Banco BTG Pactual SA ( BPAC11.SA ) to advise on a possible acquisition of Fibria, newspaper O Globo reported on its website, without saying how it obtained the information.
But two sources close to Fibria said the company is not seeking a buyer and that controlling shareholders have not received any bid.
Fibria is expected to publish fourth-quarter results after market close on Monday.
Representatives for Fibria, BTG Pactual and Paper Excellence declined to comment.
