The Lakers started the second quarter on a 13-5 run and held on for a 67-63 halftime lead. Los Angeles, which shot 51 percent in the first half, held the advantage despite allowing the Knicks to shoot 59.1 percent for the first two quarters.
Hardaway started the third quarter with six straight points, including a four-point play, as the Knicks led by as many as six points. But Los Angeles closed the quarter on a 10-0 run and headed into the fourth with a 97-89 lead.
