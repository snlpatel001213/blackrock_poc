Jan 29 (Reuters) - British telecoms company KCOM Group Plc said it expects annual core earnings to come in slightly ahead of its expectations, thanks to a multi-year rebate on its Hull and East Yorkshire network infrastructure. 
The company, which provides communications services for customers such as Aviva Plc, said revenue performance for the year ending March 31 would be slightly below its expectations. (Reporting by Rahul B in Bengaluru; Editing by Saumyadeb Chakrabarty)
