NASHVILLE, Tenn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc. (Nasdaq/NGS: PNFP) reported net income per diluted common share of $0.35 for the quarter ended Dec. 31, 2017, compared to net income per diluted common share of $0.78 for the quarter ended Dec. 31, 2016, a decrease of 55.1 percent.

There were several items negatively impacting the firm's most recent quarterly and annual results for 2017 including:
Pre-tax merger-related charges of $19.1 million and $31.8 million for the three months and year ended Dec. 31, 2017, Pre-tax investment securities losses of $8.3 million for the three months and year ended Dec. 31, 2017 and After-tax charges related to the revaluation of the firm’s deferred tax assets of $31.5 million for the three months and year ended Dec. 31, 2017.
Excluding the above items, net income per diluted common share was $0.97 and $3.57 for the three months and year ended Dec. 31, 2017, respectively, compared to net income per diluted common share of $0.83 and $3.07 for the three months and year ended Dec. 31, 2016, excluding pre-tax merger-related charges of $3.3 million and $11.7 million, respectively. As a result, net income per diluted common share excluding the above items increased:
16.9 percent in the three months ended Dec. 31, 2017, compared to the three months ended Dec. 31, 2016 and, 16.3 percent for the year ended Dec. 31, 2017, compared to the year ended Dec. 31, 2016.
"With asset growth of 98.4 percent, revenue growth of 54.3 percent, adjusted fully-diluted earnings per share growth of 16.3 percent and tangible book value per share growth of 18.2 percent, 2017 was likely our best year yet," said M. Terry Turner, Pinnacle's president and chief executive officer. "During 2017, we announced and closed our merger with BNC Bancorp (BNC), that expanded our high-growth franchise to what we believe are the best banking markets in the Carolinas. I could not be prouder of our associates for their tireless efforts to create what I believe is one of the country’s most dynamic regional banking franchises.
"I am particularly excited about our continued growth prospects heading into 2018," Turner said. "We have now completed the BNC brand and technology integrations and are well on our way to a common culture across our four-state footprint. BNC was a double-digit asset grower and remains very strong in the commercial real estate segment. Our strategy has been to continue to support BNC’s high growth commercial real estate practice while further accelerating overall growth rates with the build out of a large commercial and industrial lending practice. In addition to our ongoing hiring in our Tennessee footprint, we have previously disclosed our intent to hire 64 financial advisors in the Carolinas and Virginia over a five-year period. We are excited that hiring has been on that pace, even during this period of transition."
