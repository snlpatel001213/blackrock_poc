NEW YORK, Jan 4 (Reuters) - U.S. fund investors pulled $8.4 billion from stocks and funneled $3.3 billion into taxable bonds during the most recent week, responding to a strong year of market gains defensively, Lipper data showed on Thursday.
The data covers cash that moved into and out of U.S.-based mutual funds and exchange-traded funds during the seven days through Wednesday. (Reporting by Trevor Hunnicutt; Editing by Lisa Shumaker)
