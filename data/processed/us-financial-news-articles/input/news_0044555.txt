ABUJA, Jan 22 (Reuters) - Nigeria’s Oando has addressed all the issues raised by a key shareholder, Dahiru Mangal, and will consider a board appointment for him, the energy company said on Monday.
Oando has been in a drawn-out conflict with Mangal, who petitioned Nigeria’s Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) last year, alleging financial mismanagement at the firm.
The SEC has ordered a forensic audit into the oil company’s shareholding structure citing concerns about possible insider trading. (Reporting by Chiji Ohuocha in Abuja; Editing by Adrian Croft)
