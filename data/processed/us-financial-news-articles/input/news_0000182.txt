ISTANBUL, Jan 4 (Reuters) - Turkeyâ€™s Halkbank said on Thursday its executive Mehmet Hakan Atilla has the right to appeal against a U.S. court verdict finding him guilty of helping Iran evade U.S. sanctions and said it always adheres to national and international regulations. 
In a stock exchange filing, Halkbank said it was not a party in the U.S. court case and that there was no administrative or financial decision taken against Halkbank by the court. 
Atilla, a deputy general manager at the majority state-owned bank, was convicted on five of six counts he faced, including bank fraud and conspiracy, in Manhattan federal court. (Writing by Ezgi Erkoyun; Editing by Daren Butler and David Dolan)
