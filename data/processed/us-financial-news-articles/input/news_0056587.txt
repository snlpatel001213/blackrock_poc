The joke (and the mystery) is apparently still alive one year later: One year tomorrow since @MichelleObama made this iconic face – quite possibly the least impressed anybody has ever been receiving a Tiffany box #OneYearInOffice pic.twitter.com/MYr5jWMJqL

Maybe you, too, also wondered what was inside the box. Wonder no longer. 
“It was a lovely frame,” Obama told DeGeneres. Obama went into further detail about meeting, hinting it might have been more awkward than it looked. (Even after how now-President Donald Trump went up to greet the Obamas , leaving Melania behind to walk up by herself while carrying the gift box.) Obama described the meeting between the outgoing and incoming First Families as similar to a state visit, with a number of protocols to follow—but it seems there wasn’t much prep for a gift exchange. 
Obama’s interview on Ellen will air on Thursday. Check local listings for network and showtimes. SPONSORED FINANCIAL CONTENT
