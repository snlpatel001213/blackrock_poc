TIRANA, Jan 10 (Reuters) - Albania's average consumer price inflation rose to 2 percent in 2017, the country's Statistics Institute said on Wednesday, up from 1.3 percent in 2016 but below the central bank's 2017 target of 3 percent. Annual inflation in December 2017 was 1.8 percent, down from 2.2 percent in December 2016, the Institute added. As is usual during the holiday period, the annual rise in inflation in December came from food and non-alcoholic beverages, which rose by 1.13 percentage points.
