AZZ Accused of Misstating Revenues for its Energy Segment
According to the complaint, AZZ repeatedly assured investors of the effectiveness of the company's internal control over financial reporting and that the company was continuously evaluating new revenue recognition standards. On January 9, 2018, AZZ revealed that the company's Audit Committee and independent registered public accounting firm, BDO USA, LLP, determined that AZZ historically should have accounted differently for certain contracts within its Energy Segment. It was further revealed that AZZ failed to report revenues in compliance with FASB's Accounting Standards for over two and a half years, and that AZZ was reviewing whether there are any significant impacts to the company's audited financial statements for the fiscal years ended February 2015, 2016, and 2017, and the quarters ending May 31 and August 31, 2017. As a result, AZZ could not file its Form 10-Q for the quarter ended November 30, 2017 on time.
