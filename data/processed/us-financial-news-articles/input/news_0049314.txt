Vanderbilt shot 52.5 percent from the field, hit 11 3-pointers, and didn’t allow TCU to attempt a foul shot, as the Commodores beat the Horned Frogs, 81-78, at Nashville’s Memorial Gymnasium on Saturday afternoon.
Vanderbilt was led in scoring by forward Jeff Roberson (20) and guards Riley LaChance (24) and Saben Lee (11).
TCU (15-6) placed guards Kenrich Williams (17), Desmond Bane (12) and Alex Robinson (13) in double figures, along with forwards Kouat Noi (11) and Vladimir Brodziansky (15).
The Horned Frogs had a 36-21 edge on the glass.
It was an entertaining game with great offensive flow. Neither team managed a double-figure lead at any point. Just 11 fouls were whistled on Vanderbilt, and 10 on TCU.
TCU trailed most of the second half, but Robinson drove and banked home a tough layup from the left side to tie the game at 76 with 2:19 left.
TCU then missed a 3 on its next trip, while Vandy’s LaChance answered with a 27-footer.
Broadziansky answered with a layup, then the Commodores (8-13), after Lee missed a layup, secured the rebound.
After a time out, LaChance then hit a pair of foul shots with 10.8 left to put Vandy up, 81-78,
Noi’s 3-pointer with three seconds left missed the mark, and TCU was unable to get off another shot.
It was a game of runs in the first half.
Commodores saw a nine-point lead evaporate into a five-point deficit, then went on a run to go up nine again, before settling into a 43-40 halftime lead.
Williams’s driving layup along the right side at the 10:47 mark put the Horned Frogs up 21-15.
But Vanderbilt, with Roberson scoring nine points in succession for the Commodores, went back up 25-23 when the senior hit a 3 from the left side at 7:41.
Another Roberson 3 from the left corner put Vandy up 35-26, but a Brodziansky hook and a mid-range jumper were part of a TCU run to cut it to three at half.
Brodziansky led TCU with 11 points at half, and proved tough to stop in the low blocks.
