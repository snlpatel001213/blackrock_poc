CAPE TOWN, Jan 31 (Reuters) - South Africa’s Government Employees Pension Fund (GEPF) said on Wednesday its shareholding in Steinhoff depreciated from 24.1 billion rand ($2 billion) on Nov. 30 to 1.8 billion rand by Dec.31 in the wake an accounting scandal at the retail group. 
GEPF made the remarks in a presentation handed in to a joint committee meeting at parliament, where a preliminary hearing on Steinhoff was being held. 
Steinhoff, owner of more than 40 retail brands including Poundland in Britain, has admitted “accounting irregularities”, triggering an 85 percent share slide. ($1 = 11.8900 rand) (Reporting by Wendell Roelf; Writing by Nqobile Dludla; Editing by James Macharia)
