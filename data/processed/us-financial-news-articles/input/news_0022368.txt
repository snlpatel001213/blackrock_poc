MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico’s left-wing presidential contender retained his lead in this year’s election race as the ruling party hopeful failed to gain traction, a poll showed on Wednesday. 
Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador of the National Regeneration Movement (MORENA) party maintained a leading position in the survey published in newspaper El Economista, winning support from 23.6 percent of respondents. 
Jose Antonio Meade, the contender of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), trailed in third place at 18.2 percent, losing ground from a poll last month in which he had 19.4 percent support ahead of the July 1 general election. 
National Action Party’s (PAN) Ricardo Anaya retained second place with 20.4 percent. 
The survey conducted by Consulta Mitofsky included 1,000 face-to-face interviews with voters nationwide between Jan. 12 and 14. Reporting by Daina Beth Solomon; Editing by Andrew Hay
