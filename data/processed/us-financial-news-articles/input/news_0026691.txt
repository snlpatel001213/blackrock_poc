WASHINGTON, Jan 18 (Reuters) - A majority of the conservative House Freedom Caucus will support a stopgap spending measure to avert a U.S. government shutdown when it is voted on by the chamber likely later on Thursday, the Republican group said on Twitter.
Earlier on Thursday, the caucus chairman, Representative Mark Meadows, said at least 25 members of the group - a large majority - opposed the funding bill.
