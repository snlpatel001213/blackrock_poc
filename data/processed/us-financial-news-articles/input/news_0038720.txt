KABUL—Suspected Islamic State militants set off a suicide car bomb and then stormed a local office of Save the Children in eastern Afghanistan, triggering a nearly 10-hour gunbattle with security forces that left three people dead and 25 others wounded, provincial officials said.
As Afghan soldiers and police fought to regain control of Save the Children’s compound in Jalalabad, the capital of Nangarhar province, the international charity suspended its operations and closed its offices across Afghanistan.
