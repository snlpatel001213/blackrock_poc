According to the lawsuit, defendants during the Class Period made materially false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) RYB Education failed to establish safety policies to prevent sexual abuse from occurring at its schools; (2) RYB Education's failure to remedy problems within its system exposed children to harm and unreasonable risk of harm while in its care; and (3) as a result of the foregoing, RYB securities traded at artificially inflated prices during the Class Period. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.
