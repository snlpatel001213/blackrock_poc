The mine is expected to produce slightly stronger quarters in Q2 and Q3. In addition, 2018 is expected to see a greater proportion of the mill feed met by stoping activities as opposed to ore development. Grades from the mine are expected to be in line with those seen in 2017 with an average of 13.7 g/t Au expected across the year.
In Q3 and Q4, the processing plant tie-ins for the Bagassi South expansion are expected to occur, slightly affecting mill operating time in those periods; however, it is planned that these exercises will largely occur within planned maintenance stoppages.
