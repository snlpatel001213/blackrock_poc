TORONTO, Jan 8 (Reuters) - Canada’s main stock index retreated on Monday as shares of some materials and financial services companies weighed, offset by gains for marijuana producers.
The Toronto Stock Exchange’s S&P/TSX composite index unofficially closed down 31.79 points, or 0.19 percent, at 16,317.65. Seven of the index’s 10 main groups ended lower. (Reporting by Fergal Smith; Editing by James Dalgleish)
