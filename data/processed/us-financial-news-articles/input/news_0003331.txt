TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Thursday voiced confidence that the economy was steadily heading toward an end to deflation.
“With a domestic demand-led recovery taking hold, Japan is making steady progress toward emerging from 20 years of deflation,” Abe told a news conference.
He also said his administration would focus on labor market reforms that would boost productivity and address a shrinking working-age population amid a rapidly aging society.
