US durable goods orders rose 2.9% in Dec, vs 0.8% increase expected Published 5 Hours Ago Ty Wright | Bloomberg | Getty Images Appliances on sale in Sarasota, Florida. 
The Commerce Department says that orders for long-lasting manufactured goods rose 2.9 percent in December, the fastest pace since June and another sign of strength for American industry. 
Orders were lifted by a 15.9 percent surge in demand for civilian aircraft and aviation parts, which can bounce around from month to month. Excluding the volatile transportation sector, orders increased 0.6 percent in December. 
Overall orders for durable goods, which are meant to last at least three years, have risen in four the last five months. 
Still, a category that measures business investment — orders for nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft — dipped 0.3 percent in December. 
American manufacturers are benefiting from a pickup in global economic growth and a weaker dollar, which makes U.S. goods less expensive in foreign markets.
