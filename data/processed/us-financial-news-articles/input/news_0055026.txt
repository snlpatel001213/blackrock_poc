Jan 30 (Reuters) - The U.S. Department of Justice and Securities and Exchange Commission are investigating whether Apple Inc violated securities laws concerning its disclosures that it slowed older iPhones with flagging batteries, Bloomberg reported on Tuesday.
The government has requested information from the company, Bloomberg reported, citing people familiar with the matter. bloom.bg/2DQhxaU
The chairman of a U.S. Senate committee overseeing business issues asked Apple to answer questions about its disclosures, Reuters reported earlier this month.
Apple did not respond to request for comment.
The company admitted earlier in December that iPhone software can slow down some phones with battery problems.
Apple said the problem was that aging lithium batteries delivered power unevenly, which could cause iPhones to shut down unexpectedly to protect the delicate circuits inside. (Reporting by Munsif Vengattil in Bengaluru; Editing by Anil Dâ€˜Silva)
