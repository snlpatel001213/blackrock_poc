DALLAS, Jan. 30, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Brinker International, Inc. (NYSE: EAT) today announced results for the fiscal second quarter ended Dec. 27, 2017.
Highlights include the following:
On a GAAP basis, earnings per diluted share were $0.54 for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 representing a 21.7 percent decrease from $0.69 in the second quarter of fiscal 2017 Earnings per diluted share, excluding special items, were $0.87 for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 representing a 22.5 percent increase from $0.71 in the second quarter of fiscal 2017 (see non-GAAP reconciliation below) The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the "Tax Act") negatively impacted GAAP net income by $3.9 million or $0.08 per diluted share, consisting of $8.7 million or $0.18 per diluted share for the revaluation of the Company's net deferred tax assets, partially offset by the impact from the decrease in the statutory tax rate of $4.8 million or $0.10 per diluted share for the second quarter of 2017 Brinker International's total revenues were $766.4 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 decreasing 0.6 percent compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2017, and company sales were $742.7 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 decreasing 0.8 percent compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2017 Chili's company-owned comparable restaurant sales decreased 1.5 percent in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2017. Chili's U.S. franchise comparable restaurant sales decreased 1.7 percent in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2017 Chili's international franchise comparable restaurant sales increased 0.1 percent in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2017 Maggiano's comparable restaurant sales increased 1.8 percent in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2017 Operating income, as a percent of total revenues, was 7.1 percent for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 compared to 8.0 percent for the second quarter of fiscal 2017 representing a decrease of approximately 90 basis points Restaurant operating margin, as a percent of company sales, was 14.9 percent for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 compared to 15.1 percent for the second quarter of fiscal 2017 representing a decrease of approximately 20 basis points (see non-GAAP reconciliation below) For the first six months of fiscal 2018, cash flows provided by operating activities were $119.7 million and capital expenditures totaled $48.6 million. Free cash flow was $71.1 million (see non-GAAP reconciliation below) The Company is updating its fiscal 2018 outlook and now estimates earnings per diluted share, excluding special items and the revaluation of the Company's deferred tax accounts, to be in the range of $3.42 to $3.52 for fiscal 2018
"Brinker saw performance improve across the business during the second quarter, especially related to our initiatives to change traffic trends at Chili's," said Wyman Roberts, chief executive officer and president. "With this foundational strategy in place, we will focus on targeted segments of the business we believe will enhance the guest experience and drive traffic."

1
Comparable restaurant sales includes all restaurants that have been in operation for more than 18 months.
2
Mix-shift is calculated as the year-over-year percentage change in company sales resulting from the change in menu items ordered by guests.
3
Revenues generated by franchisees are not included in revenues on the consolidated statements of comprehensive income; however, we generate royalty revenue and advertising fees based on franchisee revenues, where applicable. We believe including franchise comparable restaurant sales provides investors information regarding brand performance that is relevant to current operations and may impact future restaurant development.
4
Chili's Domestic comparable restaurant sales percentages are derived from sales generated by company-owned and franchise-operated Chili's restaurants in the United States.
5
System-wide comparable restaurant sales are derived from sales generated by company-owned Chili's and Maggiano's restaurants in addition to the sales generated at franchise-operated Chili's restaurants.
Quarterly Operating Performance
CHILI'S second quarter company sales decreased 1.3 percent to $623.6 million from $632.1 million in the prior year primarily due to a decline in comparable restaurant sales. As compared to the prior year, Chili's restaurant operating margin 1 declined. Restaurant labor, as a percent of company sales, increased compared to the prior year due to higher wage rates, partially offset by lower employee health insurance costs and incentive bonuses. Cost of sales, as a percent of company sales, increased slightly compared to the prior year due to unfavorable product mix on beef, ribs and chicken and unfavorable commodity pricing on produce, partially offset by increased menu pricing and favorable commodity pricing on beef. Restaurant expenses, as a percent of company sales, decreased due to lower advertising and repairs and maintenance expenses, partially offset by sales deleverage.
MAGGIANO'S second quarter company sales increased 2.1 percent to $119.1 million from $116.6 million in the prior year primarily due to an increase in comparable restaurant sales. As compared to the prior year, Maggiano's restaurant operating margin 1 improved. Restaurant expenses, as a percent of company sales, decreased primarily due to sales leverage and lower property taxes, preopening and workers' compensation insurance expenses. Restaurant labor, as a percent of company sales, decreased compared to the prior year due to sales leverage and lower incentive bonuses, partially offset by higher wage rates. Cost of sales, as a percent of company sales, was negatively impacted by unfavorable commodity pricing, partially offset by increased menu pricing.
1 Restaurant operating margin is defined as Company sales less Cost of sales, Restaurant labor and Restaurant expenses and excludes Depreciation and amortization expenses. (See non-GAAP reconciliation below)
FRANCHISE AND OTHER revenues increased 6.3 percent to $23.7 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 compared to $22.3 million in the prior year second quarter primarily due to higher gift card-related revenues. Brinker franchisees generated approximately $324 million in sales 2 for the second quarter of fiscal 2018.
2 Royalty revenues are recognized based on the sales generated and reported to the Company by franchisees.
Other
Depreciation and amortization expense decreased $1.7 million for the current quarter compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2017 primarily due to an increase in fully-depreciated assets and restaurant closures, partially offset by depreciation on asset replacements and new restaurant openings.
General and administrative expense decreased $0.5 million for the current quarter compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2017 primarily due to lower compensation-related expenses.
Income Taxes
The Tax Act was enacted on December 22, 2017 with an effective date of January 1, 2018. The enactment date occurred prior to the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2018 and therefore the federal statutory tax rate changes stipulated by the Tax Act were reflected in the current quarter. The Tax Act lowered the federal statutory tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent effective January 1, 2018. Brinker's federal statutory tax rate for fiscal 2018 is now 28 percent, representing a blended tax rate for the current fiscal year based on the number of days in the fiscal year before and after the effective date. For subsequent years, our federal statutory tax rate will be 21%. We were also required to revalue our deferred tax accounts using the new federal statutory tax rate in the period in which the Tax Act was enacted. The Company's deferred tax position is a net asset and as a result, the reduction in the federal statutory tax rate resulted in a one-time non-cash adjustment to our net deferred tax balance of $8.7 million with a corresponding increase to the provision for income taxes in the second quarter of fiscal 2018.
On a GAAP basis, the effective income tax rate increased to 38.3 percent in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 from 28.2 percent in the second quarter of fiscal 2017. This increase was driven by the revaluation of the Company's deferred tax accounts pursuant to the Tax Act, partially offset by the positive impact of lowering the federal statutory tax rate and lower profits. Excluding the impact of special items and the revaluation of the Company's deferred tax accounts, the effective income tax rate decreased to 19.5 percent in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 compared to 28.1 percent in the second quarter of fiscal 2017 primarily due to the lower corporate tax rate and lower profits.
Fiscal 2018 Outlook Update
The Tax Act will have a material impact on the Company's effective tax rate for fiscal 2018. The Company estimates adjusted earnings per diluted share, excluding special items and the revaluation of the Company's deferred tax accounts, for fiscal 2018 will be in the range of $3.42 to $3.52 including the effective rate impact of the Tax Act. Previously, the Company expected the effective income tax rate excluding the impact of special items to be approximately 27 to 29 percent for fiscal 2018. The Company's effective tax rate excluding the impact of special items and the revaluation of the deferred tax accounts is now expected to be approximately 20 to 22 percent. The Company believes providing estimated fiscal 2018 earnings per diluted share guidance provides investors the appropriate insight into the Company's ongoing operating performance.
Guidance Policy
Brinker provides annual guidance as it relates to comparable restaurant sales, earnings per diluted share, excluding special items, and other key line items in the statements of comprehensive income and will only provide updates if there is a material change versus the original guidance. We are unable to reliably forecast special items such as restaurant impairments, restaurant closures, reorganization charges and legal settlements without unreasonable effort. As such, we do not present a reconciliation of forecasted non-GAAP measures to the corresponding GAAP measures. If special items are reported in the remainder of fiscal 2018, reconciliations to the appropriate GAAP measures will be provided.
Non-GAAP Measures
Brinker management uses certain non-GAAP measures in analyzing operating performance and believes that the presentation of these measures in this release provides investors with information that is beneficial to gaining an understanding of the Company's financial results. Non-GAAP disclosures should not be viewed as a substitute for financial results determined in accordance with GAAP, nor are they necessarily comparable to non-GAAP performance measures that may be presented by other companies. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures are included in the tables below.

Amounts represent the revaluation of our net deferred taxes using the new lower corporate tax rate pursuant to the Tax Act. Additionally, this amount includes $0.4 million of tax benefits from the settlement of stock-based compensation awards in the provision for income taxes.
Table 3: Reconciliation of restaurant operating margin
Q2 18 and Q2 17; $ millions
Restaurant operating margin is not a measurement determined in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered in isolation, or as an alternative to operating income as an indicator of financial performance. Restaurant operating margin is widely regarded in the restaurant industry as a useful metric by which to evaluate restaurant-level operating efficiency and performance of ongoing restaurant-level operations. We define restaurant operating margin as Company sales less Company restaurant expenses, including Cost of sales, Restaurant labor and Restaurant expenses. Restaurant expenses includes advertising expense. We believe this metric provides a more useful comparison between periods and enables investors to focus on the performance of restaurant-level operations by excluding revenues not related to food and beverage sales at company-owned restaurants, corporate General and administrative expense, Depreciation and amortization, and Other gains and charges.
Restaurant operating margin excludes Franchise and other revenues which are earned primarily from franchise royalties and other non-food and beverage revenue streams such as banquet service charges, digital entertainment revenues and gift card breakage. Depreciation and amortization expense, substantially all of which is related to restaurant-level assets, is excluded because such expenses represent historical costs which do not reflect current cash outlays for the restaurants. General and administrative expense includes primarily non-restaurant-level costs associated with support of the restaurants and other activities at our corporate offices and is therefore excluded. We believe that excluding special items, included within Other gains and charges, from restaurant operating margin provides investors with a clearer perspective of the Company's ongoing operating performance and a more useful comparison to prior period results. Restaurant operating margin as presented may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies in our industry.
