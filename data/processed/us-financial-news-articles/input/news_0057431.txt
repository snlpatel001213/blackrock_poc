MYRTLE BEACH, S.C., Jan. 30, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- South Atlantic Bancshares, Inc. (the "Company") (OTCQX: SABK), parent of South Atlantic Bank, today reported net income of $3,414,260 for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $2,603,928 for the same period a year ago. These figures represent a 31.1 percent increase in net income.
Financial Highlights
Year-end 2017 represents the Company's best financial performance in its 10-year history. Net income per diluted share was $0.62 for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $0.47 for the year ended December 31, 2016. Credit quality remains strong with net charge-offs to total average assets of just 0.01 percent at December 31, 2017. The net interest margin improved to 4.02 percent at year end 2017, compared to 3.86 percent at year end 2016. Total loans grew 18.4 percent, to $436.8 million at December 31, 2017, from $369.0 million at December 31, 2016. Total deposits grew 14.9 percent, to $439.2 million at December 31, 2017, from $382.3 million at December 31, 2016. Total assets grew 16.8 percent, to $519.1 million at December 31, 2017, from $444.5 million at December 31, 2016.
"The Company achieved record profitability while reaching several important goals," said K. Wayne Wicker, chairman of the board and chief executive officer. "Our double digit increase in net income can be attributed to several factors, including the Bank's expanded geographic footprint which fueled growth in the commercial loan portfolio, and a record year in production for the Bank's mortgage loan department. All markets contributed to the Company's performance in 2017.
"The strong showing is all the more significant due to the Company's achievements in 2017," Wicker said. "During the first quarter, the Company completed a $20 million capital raise through the sale of its common stock. This additional capital will help support the Bank's continued growth goals and expansion going forward. In the third quarter, the Bank expanded its presence in Charleston, establishing a regional headquarters in Mount Pleasant and opening an office on East Bay Street, both of which have been well-received in the market. In the fourth quarter, the Company announced its agreement to acquire Atlantic Bancshares, Inc. which will add banking offices in Hilton Head and Bluffton to the South Atlantic Bank footprint. We expect to complete the merger by the end of April with conversion of the Atlantic Community Bank offices to the South Atlantic Bank brand in June."
