"HeadSpin is reimagining the continuous monitoring, performance testing and user experience management landscape," said Krishnan. "The solutions available are no longer applicable to today's world of rapid mobile adoption, and engineers and QA professionals need a solution pre and post-release that is easy by design. HeadSpin will support and maintain their applications’ performance and health."
HeadSpin helps mobile application developers, that serve more than a billion monthly active users globally, build high quality mobile experiences. With customers like Akamai, Telstra, Dell and Tinder, HeadSpin has helped mobile application developers identify 1% of their performance issues that cause 80% of the user complaints and 60% of their user experience issues pre-release, resulting in a 40% improvement in customer experience and 25% improvement in application reliability.
"Sriram comes to HeadSpin with a proven track record of scaling well known technology companies like Spotify and Tinder," said Manish Lachwani, co-founder and CEO of HeadSpin. "HeadSpin is already used by some of the largest enterprises in the world. My goal is to continue building the team so that we continue to cater to the demand from application developers that are enthusiastic about our simple yet powerful mobile experience solution."
Krishnan brings a decade of experience in high-tech companies to the new role. Prior to joining HeadSpin, he was the Head of International Growth at Tinder -- the number one grossing mobile application in the world -- which is owned by Match Group, a publicly traded company. His marketing strategies enabled Tinder to become the largest and most recognized market leader and secure a dominant market share position in key markets. He previously was the co-founder and COO of Cosmify, a knowledge discovery startup that was acquired by Meltwater, a leading media intelligence and social monitoring company, in early 2017.
