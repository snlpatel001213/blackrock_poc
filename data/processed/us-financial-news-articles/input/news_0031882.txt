PARIS (Reuters) - Airbus Chief Operating Officer Fabrice Bregier said on Friday that Emirates’ latest order for up to 36 A380 aircraft worth $16 billion at list price would allow the European planemaker to maintain a minimum production level of the superjumbo. 
Emirates’ [EMIRA.UL] commitment to take six of the double-decker A380s a year for a decade, including previous orders, fills a gap in planned production as Airbus touts business from other airlines. 
“Orders now are sufficient to maintain the program at a minimum level,” Bregier told RTL radio. Reporting by Mathieu Rosemain; Editing by Richard Lough
