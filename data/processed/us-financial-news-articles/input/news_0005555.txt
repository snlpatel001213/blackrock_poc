She hasn't spent a dime on advertising.
Even so, Roxanne Assoulin's eponymous jewelry line has grown 300 percent year-over-year thanks to one thing: The power of social media.
Admittedly, that's a shock to the 61-year-old designer who didn't have a carefully crafted business plan — or even a website — when she stumbled onto her first enamel bracelet prototype in 2016 and posted it on Instagram. But it is a sign of the times.
"I had these [enamel] tiles sitting on my desk for literally 30 years. We drew up a bracelet and I knew it was something," said Assoulin, who has been in the jewelry business for nearly four decades, previously as a private label designer for big names such as Urban Outfitters , J.Crew and Banana Republic.
"We drew up a bracelet and I knew it was something." -Roxanne Assoulin, jewelry designer Clearly Assoulin is well established and well connected. Still, she showed samples to her children as a gut check — including daughter-in-law Rosie Assoulin , a successful fashion designer in her own right.

"My marketing is more gifting than paying for ads," she said. (
