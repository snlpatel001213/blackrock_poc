FLORENCE, Italy, Jan 29 (Reuters) - Italy Industry Minister Carlo Calenda said on Monday that a decision on a possible fine against Telecom Italia (TIM) over golden power ruling infringement will be taken before the March 4 vote.
Speaking to journalists on the the sidelines of a meeting in Florence, the minister said that if it’s decided that there is a need for a fine, one would be applied “because we are a country that wants rules to be respected”.
“The situation will be made clear before the vote. We don’t wait until the election to do things,” Calenda said.
Italy has launched a process that could end with TIM being fined for failing to notify Rome that French media group Vivendi , TIM’s top shareholder with a 24 percent stake, had assumed de facto control of the phone company.
