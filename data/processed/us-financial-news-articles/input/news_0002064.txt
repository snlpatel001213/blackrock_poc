“Bomb cyclone” Grayson is delivering freezing temperatures, sleet, ice, and snow from Maine to Florida . And while the Northeast is expected to receive the brunt of the “winter hurricane” , potentially record-breaking weather is also hitting Southeast states. 
On Wednesday morning, Grayson delivered 0.1 inch of snow and sleet to Florida’s capital, Tallahassee, according to the National Weather Service. It was the first measurable snow there in 28 years, according to Weather.com , and led to closing parts of Interstate 10 on Wednesday morning.

Other southern states, including North Carolina, Virginia, Georgia and South Carolina, are also preparing for snowfall. “This could be one of the heaviest one-day snowfalls on record in both Savannah, Georgia, and Charleston, South Carolina,” Weather.com reported.
