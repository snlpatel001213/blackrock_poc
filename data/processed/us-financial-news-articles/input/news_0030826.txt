Divestiture
During the fourth quarter, the Company entered into an agreement to sell its ownership interest in Anchor in a transaction that will result in Anchor being majority owned by members of its management team. The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2018. Results attributed to Anchor’s performance remain consolidated in the Company’s results during current and prior periods.
