SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court on Monday agreed to reconsider an earlier ruling which had blocked a San Francisco law that mandated health warnings for soda and other sugary drinks. 
A three-judge panel on the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals had blocked the San Francisco ordinance last year. In an order on Monday, the appeals court said it would rehear the case before a larger, 11-judge panel. Reporting by Dan Levine; Editing by Paul Simao
