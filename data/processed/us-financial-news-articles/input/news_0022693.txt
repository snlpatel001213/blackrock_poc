The robust top-line growth continued in France, with sales totaling €1,582 K versus €1,182 K in 2016. That represents an increase of 34% over the full year and of 36% in the fourth quarter of 2017. In the second half of 2017, Safe Orthopaedics hired two new sales representatives, who will have a positive impact on business in 2018.
Sales in the Rest of the world (excluding United States) continued to grow, with the top line advancing 41% to €1,527 K in 2017. High growth was mainly generated by longstanding distributors and rapid expansion in Latin America. Following very strong revenue growth in the third quarter, orders were affected by a minor catch-up effect in the fourth quarter due to a business contraction in the Middle East. As a result, Safe Orthopaedics decided together with its distributor to respond by introducing fresh commercial initiatives to revitalize sales in the region in 2018. During the fourth quarter of 2017, Safe Orthopaedics also hired a 25year experience sales manager covering export markets.
Safe Orthopaedics expanded into Germany during 2017, and the company intends to extend its French in selling its products on this territory. A team of sales Director and two sales representatives was hired to develop business in Germany. Their knowledge of the local market and their long experience in the spinal surgery sector will be valuable assets for its development. Safe Orthopaedics also attended the DWG German Spine Congress, during which the company presented its innovative product ranges and comforted its position on the German market.
Safe Orthopaedics reinforced its marketing team and implemented a European action plan. Plan will be mostly focused on boosting sales support and provide surgeons with a number of training courses to treat vertebral fractures.
Cash position
At December 31, 2017, Safe Orthopaedics had €3,725 thousands in available cash, compared with €3,664 thousands at December 31, 2016. Its cash position was strengthened by the successful completion in June 2017 of a €5.8 million rights issue. The capital it raised gave Safe Orthopaedics the requisite additional resources to bolster its French and international sales teams and to convince surgeons of the benefits of single-use instruments in each market segment.
