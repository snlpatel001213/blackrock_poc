E-Trade Financial has opened trading in CME bitcoin futures for customers beginning at 6 p.m. ET on Tuesday, according to its website.
It is the latest online brokerage to expand trading in the relatively new products.
Futures exchanges Cboe and CME began offering bitcoin futures in mid-December after a wild run-up in the price of the underlying bitcoin cryptocurrency last year.
Interactive Brokers also rolled out trading in the products last month, and TD Ameritrade and E-Trade began offering customers access to Cboe futures as well.
Cboe Global Markets was the first to offer a bitcoin future followed a week later by CME.
