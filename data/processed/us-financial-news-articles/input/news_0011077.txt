(the “Company”) (TSX:CXI) (OTCBB:CURN), is pleased to announce its financial results and present management's discussion and analysis (" MD&A ") for the three month period and year ended October 31, 2017 (all figures are in U.S. dollars except where otherwise indicated). The complete financial statements and MD&A can be found on the Company's SEDAR profile at www.sedar.com.
Financial Highlights for the Year Ended October 31, 2017 compared to the Year Ended October 31, 2016:
During the year ended October 31, 2017, transactional activity between the Company and its customers increased 38.3% to 974,000 transactions from 704,000 for the year ended October 31, 2016. Since October 31, 2016, the Company has added 49 new wholesale banknote relationships representing 1,423 new transacting locations as well as three new branch locations;
Revenues increased 21% or $5.6 million to $32.5 million for the year ended October 31, 2017 from $26.8 million for the year ended October 31, 2016;
Net operating income increased 15% or $1 million to $7.9 million for the year ended October 31, 2017 from $6.9 million for the year ended October 31, 2016. The increase in net operating income is attributable to an increase in the number of customer transactions resulting from the addition of three new CXI branches as well as 10% growth in wholesale banknote transacting locations since October 31, 2016; and
Net income increased 5% or $180,000 to $3.8 million for the year ended October 31, 2017 from $3.6 million for the year ended October 31, 2016. The lower rate of growth in net income compared to net operating income is attributable to a 56% increase in income tax expense that arose because of a change in the mix of income between the Company’s Canadian and US based operations.
Financial Highlights for the Three Month Period Ended October 31, 2017 compared to the Three Month Period Ended October 31, 2016:
During the three month period ended October 31, 2017, transactional activity between the Company and its customers increased 31% to 278,000 transactions from 211,000 for the three month period ended October 31, 2016;

Net operating income increased 18% or $390,000 to $2.6 million for the three month period ended October 31, 2017 from $2.2 million for the three month period ended October 31, 2016. The increase in net operating income was primarily due to an increase in the number of customer transactions resulting from the addition of three new CXI branches as well as 10% growth in wholesale banknote transacting locations since October 31, 2016; and
Net income decreased 3% or $42,000 to $1.3 million for the three month period ended October 31, 2017 from $1.4 million for the three month period ended October 31, 2016. The decrease in net income is primarily due to increased income tax expense in the quarter.
