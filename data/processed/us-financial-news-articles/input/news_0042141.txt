DETROIT, Jan 24 (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co on Wednesday reported a quarterly net profit, versus a loss in the same period in 2016 caused by pension liabilities, but said its pre-tax profit was hit by commodity costs and unfavorable currency exchange rates.
The No. 2 U.S. automaker reported quarterly net income of $2.41 billion or 60 cents per share, versus a loss of $781 million or 20 cents per share a year earlier. Adjusted for one-time items, Ford reported earnings per share of 39 cents. On that basis, analysts had on average expected earnings per share of 42 cents.
