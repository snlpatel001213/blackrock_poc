The 21-year-old Denmark international has made 22 appearances for the English champions this term having cemented his place at the heart of Antonio Conte’s three-man defence. 
Christensen returned to Chelsea in the close season after two years on loan at Borussia Moenchengladbach in the Bundesliga. 
“It feels really good to sign a new contract and I’m just happy to be committed to Chelsea for the future. I’ve played a lot of games, I’m enjoying it at the club and everything is working well,” he said on the club website (www.chelseafc.com). 
Christensen helped Denmark qualify for this year’s World Cup by scoring in their 5-1 playoff win over Ireland in November. Reporting by Toby Davis; editing by Ken Ferris
