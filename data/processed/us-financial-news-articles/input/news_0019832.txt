Joel Berry II made two free throws with 7.1 seconds left and No. 20 North Carolina made a final defensive stand to defeat Notre Dame 69-68 on Saturday night at the Joyce Center in South Bend, Ind.
Notre Dame’s TJ Gibbs missed two shots on its final possession, including his putback attempt that bounced around the rim and fell away.
Luke Maye scored 13 of his 18 points in the first half, Berry finished with 15 points and Theo Pinson added 13 points for North Carolina (14-4, 3-2 Atlantic Coast Conference). Maye had 11 rebounds.
Gibbs tallied 19 points for Notre Dame (13-5, 3-2). Martinas Geben had 14 points, and Nikola Djogo provided 12 points.
The go-ahead sequence was an adventure as North Carolina’s Sterling Manley bobbled an inbound pass with four seconds on the shot clock. Berry rebounded Manley’s air ball and barely got the shot off before the shot clock expired with 7.1 seconds on the game clock.
