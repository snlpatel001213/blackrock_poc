ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkey’s military forces entered Syria’s Afrin province on Sunday, broadcaster Haberturk said, citing Prime Minister Binali Yildirim.
The military’s entrance into Afrin comes a day after Turkey launched air strikes in the region, targeting the U.S.-backed Syrian Kurdish YPG militia.
