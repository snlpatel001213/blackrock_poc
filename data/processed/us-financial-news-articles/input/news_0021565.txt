DALLAS--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Zix Corporation (Zix), (Nasdaq: ZIXI), a leader in email security, will host a conference call and webcast to discuss the company’s financial results for the fourth quarter and full-year 2017 on Thursday, February 22, 2018, at 5:00 p.m. ET. Zix’s financial results will be available on its investor relations Web site at http://investor.zixcorp.com and announced in a press release after the close of NASDAQ market hours on February 22, 2018.
All interested parties are invited to hear Dave Wagner , Zix’s Chief Executive Officer, and Dave Rockvam , Zix’s Chief Financial Officer, review the company’s financial results, 2017 business highlights, priorities for 2018 and the potential financial impact of the recently enacted U.S. tax reform legislation.
This change in U.S. tax law (effective January 1, 2018) will impact Zix’s fourth quarter 2017 financial results as a result of a required re-measurement of our deferred tax asset to reflect the future effect of the lower corporate income tax rate. Although the re-measurement is not complete, Zix expects the reduction in the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% to result in a one-time, non-cash charge to our GAAP earnings to be between $13 million and $18 million. Over the long term, however, Zix expects the impact to be generally favorable. More information will be provided in the company’s February 22, 2018, press release and annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017.
