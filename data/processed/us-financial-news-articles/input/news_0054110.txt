(Reuters) - Trucking company Knight-Swift Transportation Holdings Inc ( KNX.N ) on Tuesday posted a higher quarterly profit that beat Wall Street forecasts, boosted by changes to the U.S. tax law and strong freight demand. 
But North Americaâ€™s largest full truckload carrier reported revenue that fell short of analyst projections. 
The Phoenix, Arizona-based company reported fourth-quarter earnings of $447.56 million, or $2.50 per diluted share, up from $22.16 million, or 27 cents per diluted share in the year-ago period. 
Adjusting for one-time items, Knight-Swift reported earnings per share of 52 cents. Wall Street analysts expected 41 cents. Reporting by Eric M. Johnson in Seattle; Editing by David Gregorio
