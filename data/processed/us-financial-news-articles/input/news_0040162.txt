"We are pleased to report our first fiscal quarter for 2018 fiscal year with robust academic, financial and operating results," said Jerry He, Bright Scholar's Chief Executive Officer. "Our performance is a reflection of our commitment to quality education and to delivering the best academic results for our students. We are delighted that student enrollment has gone up 17% year–on-year with approximately 34,163 students enrolled at our schools as of November 30, 2017. We provide our students with premier education services that have consistently delivered outstanding academic outcomes. As of the date of this release, approximately 51.0% of students in the 2018 graduating class of our international schools have received over 350 offers from global top 50 institutions. We anticipate a growing proportion of our student body receiving offers from these elite institutions and continuous improvement in student grades across all age groups this academic year."
"We have delivered a very strong set of business and operational results and executed our business strategies well by remaining steadfast in our strategic priorities, maintaining rigorous discipline on maximizing profitability and focusing investments on long term profitable growth. Our revenue grew by 23.0% with further margin expansion as supported by continuous enhancement within existing schools in utilization, student/teacher ratio and effective cost management."
"Our results in first fiscal quarter demonstrate the continued progress we are making on our strategy. The rapid expansion of our network has never been more critical to our business success. We currently expect to open 12 new schools during fiscal 2018 of which eight commenced operation during the first fiscal quarter. In December 2017, we have entered into an agreement to acquire 75% equity interests in five kindergartens to further strengthen our foothold in Hubei province of China. We currently expect to complete the acquisition by the end of the second fiscal quarter."
"We could not have furthered our success without the support of our senior business and academic leaders and ongoing recruitment and retention of top talents, which are critical building blocks to our long term and sustainable business growth. On December 15, 2017, our board of directors granted share options to purchase approximately 900,000 Class A ordinary shares of the Company or 17% of the total shares reserved under our current share incentive plan, to school principals and management team members with vesting period varying from 3 to 5 years. We expect the dilution impact to be less than 1% on a fully converted basis."
"We are very pleased with the positive industry trends, the encouraging regulatory environments and full year outlook for the business. In fiscal 2018, we will continue to pursue domestic and international strategic investment opportunities in network expansion, test preparation, college counselling and extra curriculum that would further strengthen Bright Scholar's position as the leader in the premium school market and will provide significant momentum to our continued growth."

STATEMENT REGARDING UNAUDITED FINANCIAL INFORMATION
The unaudited financial information set forth above is subject to adjustments that may be identified when audit work is performed on the Company's year-end financial statements, which could result in significant differences from this unaudited financial information.
CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION
The Company's business is primarily conducted in China and almost all of the revenues are denominated in RMB. However, periodic reports made to shareholders will include current period amounts translated into U.S. dollars using the then current exchange rates, for the convenience of the readers. Translations of balances in the combined and consolidated balance sheets, and the related combined and consolidated statements of operations, shareholders' equity and cash flows from RMB into US dollars as of and for the year ended November 30, 2017 are solely for the convenience of the readers and were calculated at the rate of US$1.00=RMB 6.6090, representing the noon buying rate set forth in the H.10 statistical release of the U.S. Federal Reserve Board on November 30, 2017. No representation is made that the RMB amounts could have been, or could be, converted, realized or settled into US$ at that rate on November, 2017, or at any other rate.
NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
In evaluating our business, we consider and use certain non-GAAP measures, including primarily adjusted EBITDA and adjusted net income/(loss), as supplemental measures to review and assess our operating performance. The presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We define adjusted EBITDA as income from operations (which excludes interest income, income tax benefit and expense and depreciation and amortization expenses) excluding share-based compensation expenses and adjusted net income/(loss) as net income/(loss) excluding share-based compensation expenses. We define adjusted SG&A as expense excluding share-based compensation expenses. We incurred share-based compensation in the 2016 fiscal year only, which was associated with the acquisition of Mr. Jerry He's equity interests in Impetus in January 2016.
We present the non-GAAP financial measures because they are used by our management to evaluate our operating performance and formulate business plans. Such non-GAAP measures, including adjusted EBITDA and adjusted net income/(loss), enable our management to assess our operating results without considering the impact of non-cash charges, including depreciation expenses and share-based compensation expenses, and without considering the impact of non-operating items such as interest income and income tax benefit and expenses. We also believe that the use of the non-GAAP measure facilitate investors' assessment of our operating performance.
The non-GAAP financial measures are not defined under U.S. GAAP and are not presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools. One of the key limitations of using these non-GAAP financial measures is that they do not reflect all items of income and expense that affect our operations. Interest income, income tax benefit and expenses, depreciation expenses and share-based compensation expenses have been and may continue to be incurred in our business and are not reflected in the presentation of these non-GAAP measures, including adjusted EBITDA or adjusted net income/(loss). Further, these non-GAAP measures may differ from the non-GAAP information used by other companies, including peer companies, and therefore their comparability may be limited.
