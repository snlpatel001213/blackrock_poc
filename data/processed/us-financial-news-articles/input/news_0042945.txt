CARACAS, Jan 24 (Reuters) - Venezuela will relaunch its DICOM exchange rate on Thursday, Vice President Tareck El Aissami said at a press conference.
He did not specify the rate. DICOM is the weaker of the governmentâ€™s two official exchange mechanisms, currently at 3,345 bolivars per dollar.
The stronger DIPRO rate is at 10 per dollar, a far cry from the black market rate where a dollar buys more than 260,000 bolivars. (Reporting by Girish Gupta; Editing by Alexandra Ulmer)
