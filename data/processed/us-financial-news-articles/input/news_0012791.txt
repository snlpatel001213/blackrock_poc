I’ve racked up an embarrassing amount of time playing Desert Golfing on my iPhone X. It’s a lovely little app. It’s so stupid. Some horrible friend recommended it. I can’t remember who, but if I ever do, I need to punch that person in the face. The most humiliating thing is I think I have played more than 1,500 holes on it.

I’ve got a 1960s-era Omega Speedmaster Pro (similar model shown above) that was kind of a pre-shoot present to myself. I wore it through pretty much the whole production. It’s nice because it’s got a chronograph...
