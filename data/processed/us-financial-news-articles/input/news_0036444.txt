WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump will roll out the red carpet for French President Emmanuel Macron in late April when the White House hosts the first state visit of Trump’s presidency, a senior administration official said on Tuesday. 
The formal visit will include a state dinner hosted by Trump and his wife, Melania. 
Trump and Macron have developed a friendly relationship over the past year, though it got off to an unusual start. The two leaders gripped hands so tightly during their first meeting that their knuckles turned white. 
They also have struggled to find common ground on two major international issues: the 2015 Paris climate accord and the Iran nuclear deal. 
But in a July visit to Paris, Trump was delighted by a military parade to mark France’s annual Bastille Day holiday and the 100th anniversary of the U.S. entry into World War One, and has said Macron is “doing a terrific job in France.” Reporting by Steve Holland; Editing by Paul Simao
