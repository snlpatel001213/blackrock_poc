10-year compensation plan aims for Tesla market cap of $650 billion Bloomberg News/Landov

Tesla Inc. said it updated the pay package for Chief Executive Elon Musk with a plan that again ties his compensation entirely to key performance benchmarks--albeit this time much larger ones, including an ultimate goal to hit $650 billion in market value. 
The pay plan, which shareholders must still approve, is designed to keep Musk as Tesla’s TSLA, +0.65% top leader for years to come--although allows for the prospect that he might evolve away from the day-to-day role of CEO into one of executive chairman and chief product officer. 
The plan, which is modeled on an earlier program set for Musk in 2012, entails a 10-year grant of stock options that would vest in 12 tranches. Each would vest only if a set of two milestones are achieved, one based on market value, the other on a measure of revenue or profit. For each tranche achieved, Musk would receive shares equal to 1% of the company’s total shares outstanding as of Jan. 21, 2018. 
For example, the first tranche would vest if Tesla hits $100 billion in market value and $20 billion in revenue or $1.5 billion in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, after adjusting for stock compensation. For all 12 tranches to vest, Tesla’s market value would have to reach $650 billion.
