WASHINGTON, Jan 22 (Reuters) - Legislation to fund the U.S. government through Feb. 8 overwhelmingly cleared a procedural hurdle in the Senate, putting it on course for a final vote in the chamber as lawmakers aimed to end a partial shutdown that began on Saturday.
In voting 81-18 on Monday to limit debate on the bill, the Senate moved closer to a vote on passage. If that vote succeeds, the measure would go to the House of Representatives for consideration. (Reporting by Richard Cowan; Editing by Susan Heavey and Chizu Nomiyama)
