LOS ANGELES, Jan. 22, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- RBB Bancorp (NASDAQ:RBB) and its subsidiaries, Royal Business Bank ("the Bank") and RBB Asset Management Company ("RAM"), collectively referred to herein as "the Company", announced financial results for the quarter ended December 31, 2017.
The Company reported net income of $4.9 million, or $0.29 diluted earnings per share, for the three months ended December 31, 2017, compared to net income of $6.6 million, or $0.42 diluted earnings per share, and $5.4 million, or $0.39 diluted earnings per share, for the three months ended September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. Included in the fourth quarter 2017 results is a $2.4 million, or $0.14 per diluted share, write-down related to the reduction in the value of the Company's net deferred tax assets as a result of the decrease in the federal corporate tax rate.
"We had a milestone year in 2017, completing our initial public offering and generating the highest level of net income in the history of the Company," said Mr. Alan Thian, Chairman, President and CEO of RBB Bancorp. "We continued our positive momentum in the fourth quarter, generating strong loan growth, an improvement in our efficiency ratio, and pristine asset quality."
"In 2018, we plan to continue expanding our franchise through a combination of organic growth, acquisitions and de novo branch openings. In addition, we are investing in the business to diversify our revenue mix and provide additional catalysts for generating organic growth. Our Wealth Management unit is up and running. In addition we have hired a specialist to start our income property unit, mainly apartments, mobile home parks and student housing properties. We are also finalizing the hiring of a new SBA manager who will lead our business development efforts, as well as recruit new team members," concluded Mr. Thian.
Key Performance Ratios
Net income of $4.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 produced an annualized return on average equity of 7.31% and an annualized return on average assets of 1.18%. The efficiency ratio for the fourth quarter of 2017 was 31.8%, compared to 39.0% for the prior quarter. Adjusted annualized return on average assets and average tangible common equity for the fourth quarter of 2017 was 1.51% and 10.60%, respectively compared to 1.55% and 11.97% for the third quarter of 2017. (See adjusted earnings metrics table on the last page).
Net Interest Income and Net Interest Margin
Net interest income, before provision for loan losses, was $17.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $14.7 million for the third quarter of 2017. The increase was primarily attributable to a $43.3 million increase in average earning assets, combined with a 71 basis point increase in the net interest margin. Accretion of purchase discounts contributed $2.7 million to net interest income in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $0.6 million in the third quarter of 2017. The increase in accretion income was primarily attributable to the early payoff of one large acquired loan.
Compared to the fourth quarter of 2016, net interest income, before provision for loan losses, increased from $13.5 million. The increase was primarily attributable to a $187.8 million increase in average earning assets, partially resulting from the proceeds from the Company's July 2017 IPO, combined with a 64 basis point increase in the net interest margin.
Net interest margin was 4.62% for the fourth quarter of 2017, an increase from 3.91% in the third quarter of 2017. The increase was primarily attributable to a 67 basis point increase in the yield on earning assets (primarily due to a favorable shift in the mix of earning assets and to higher loan discount accretion income). Loan discount accretion contributed 71 basis points to the net interest margin in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to 17 basis points in the third quarter of 2017.
Compared to the fourth quarter of 2016, net interest margin increased from 3.98%. The increase was primarily attributable to a 62 basis point increase in the yield on earning assets, primarily due to a favorable shift in the mix of earning assets.
Noninterest Income
Noninterest income was $3.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, unchanged from $3.8 million in the third quarter of 2017. In the fourth quarter, gain on loan sales increased by $366,000, but was offset by a $163,000 net decrease in service charges and loan servicing fees and a $142,000 decrease in gain on OREO sale.
The Company sold $90.3 million in mortgage loans for a net gain of $2.0 million during the quarter ended December 31, 2017, compared to $43.4 million in mortgage loans for a net gain of $1.0 million during the quarter ended September 30, 2017. The Company originated $120.5 million in mortgage loans for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, compared with $118.6 million during the quarter ended September 30, 2017.
The Company sold $16.6 million in SBA loans for a net gain of $1.0 million during the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $22.6 million in SBA loans for a net gain of $1.6 million during the third quarter of 2017. SBA loan originations for the fourth quarter were $1.9 million, compared to $19.3 million for the third quarter of 2017. The decrease in SBA loan originations was attributable to the departure of certain SBA business development officers.
Compared to the fourth quarter of 2016, noninterest income increased from $2.7 million. The increase was primarily attributable to an additional $1.2 million in gains on loan sales.
Noninterest Expense
Noninterest expense for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $6.9 million, compared to $7.2 million for the third quarter of 2017. The decrease was primarily attributable to a $215,000 reduction in legal and professional expenses.
Compared to the fourth quarter of 2016, noninterest expense increased from $5.5 million. The $1.4 million increase was primarily due to an increase in salaries and employee benefits of $979,000 and an increase in other expenses of $491,000, partially offset by decreases in data processing costs.
Income Taxes
On December 22, 2017, "H.R.1", formerly known as the "Tax Cuts and Jobs Act", was signed into law. Among other items, H.R.1 reduces the federal corporate tax rate to 21% effective January 1, 2018. As a result, RBB concluded that the reduction in the federal corporate tax rate required the revaluation of the Company's net deferred tax assets. The Company's net deferred tax assets represents net operating loss carryforwards that will be used to reduce corporate taxes expected to be paid in the future as well as differences between the carrying amounts and tax bases of assets and liabilities carried on the Company's balance sheet. The Company performed an analysis and determined that the value of the deferred tax assets had declined by $2.4 million. To reflect the decline in the value of the deferred tax assets, the Company recorded additional tax expense of $2.4 million during the fourth quarter of 2017.
The effective tax rate for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017 was 60.5% and 45.5%, respectively, compared with 41.9% and 41.4% for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2016, respectively.
As a result of the newly enacted tax legislation, the Company estimates that its effective tax rate for 2018 will be in the range of 29% and 31%. The estimated annual effective tax rate will vary depending upon tax-advantaged income, stock option exercises, and available tax credits.
Loan Portfolio
Loans held for investment, net of deferred fees and discounts, totaled $1.25 billion as of December 31, 2017, an increase of $52.6 million, or 17.4% annualized growth, from $1.2 billion at September 30, 2017, and an increase of $138.6 million, or 12.5%, from December 31, 2016. The increase in loans held for investment from the end of the prior quarter was primarily attributable to growth in the commercial & industrial and residential real estate portfolios.
Mortgage loans held for sale were $125.8 million as of December 31, 2017, essentially unchanged from $125.7 million at September 30, 2017.
Deposits
Deposits were at $1.34 billion at December 31, 2017, an increase of $19.0 million, or 5.7% annualized growth, from $1.32 billion at September 30, 2017, and an increase of $184.5 million, or 16.0%, from December 31, 2016. The increase in total deposits from the end of the prior quarter was attributable to growth in interest-bearing non-maturity deposits, partially offset by decreases in certificates of deposit.
Noninterest-bearing deposits decreased slightly to $285.7 million as of December 31, 2017, compared to $287.6 million at September 30, 2017 and $174.3 million at December 31, 2016.
Asset Quality
Nonperforming assets totaled $2.9 million, or 0.17% of total assets at December 31, 2017, a decline from $4.2 million, or 0.26% of total assets, at September 30, 2017. Nonperforming assets consist of Other Real Estate Owned (foreclosed properties), loans modified under troubled debt restructurings (TDRs), non-accrual loans, and loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing interest. Nonperforming assets exclude PCI loans acquired in prior acquisitions.
Loans held-for-investment 30 to 89 days past due increased to $2.9 million at December 31, 2017, up from $2.4 million at September 30, 2017. One loan held-for-sale in the amount of $697,000 that was 30 to 89 days past due at December 31, 2017, was brought current in January.
Net charge-offs were 0.01% of average loans during the fourth quarter of 2017, consisting of $83,000 in gross charge-offs, and no loan loss recoveries.
The Company recorded provision for loan losses of $2.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, which was primarily attributable to the growth in total loans during the quarter. During the fourth quarter a Tomato Bank loan was paid off, eliminating the associated credit discount and thus requiring an additional $1.0 million replenishment of our loan loss provision.
The allowance for loan losses totaled $13.8 million, or 1.10% of total loans, at December 31, 2017, compared with $11.4 million, or 0.95% of total loans, at September 30, 2017.

Adjusted Earnings Metrics (non-GAAP)
Management uses the measure adjusted earnings to assess the performance of our core business and the strength of our capital position. We believe that this non-GAAP financial measure provides meaningful additional information about us to assist investors in evaluating our operating results. This non-GAAP financial measure should not be considered a substitute for operating results determined in accordance with GAAP and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures used by other companies. The following table reconciles adjusted earnings, adjusted diluted earnings per share, adjusted return on average assets and adjusted return on average tangible common equity to their most comparable GAAP measures.
