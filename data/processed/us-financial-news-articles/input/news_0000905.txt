SEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- OncoResponse today announced it has expanded its scientific leadership through the additions of Anil Singhal, Ph.D., and Kamal D. Puri, Ph.D., to the management team. Dr. Singhal joins OncoResponse from AbbVie, where he helped build an impressive portfolio and key translational science capabilities in oncology, immunology and other diseases. Dr. Puri joins from Celgene, where he discovered new molecular entities for the immunology pipeline and identified and supported new indications for portfolio molecules. Drs. Singhal and Puri have been appointed Chief Scientific Officer and Vice President of Research and Development, respectively.
“The addition of Anil and Kamal represents a tremendous step for OncoResponse in our effort to increase the success rate of cancer immunotherapies,” said Clifford J. Stocks, CEO of OncoResponse. “Kamal brings tremendous immunology expertise and played a key role in the development and approval of Zydelig. Anil has overseen the progression of numerous product candidates from early stage research into clinical development.”
During his tenure at AbbVie, Dr. Singhal oversaw the global regulatory approvals of Empliciti in multiple myeloma and Zinbryta in multiple sclerosis and helped build a leading portfolio and key translational science capabilities in oncology, immunology and other diseases. In all, Dr. Singhal has held senior roles in the U.S., Japanese and German biopharma/biotechnology industry for over 30 years.
Dr. Puri has more than 20 years of research and development experience in immunology, oncology and neurobiology. Prior to Celgene, Dr. Puri was Associate Director of Research at Gilead and contributed to the approval of Zydelig, a first-in-class PI3K delta inhibitor for the treatment of hematological malignancies. He also led teams to deliver a best-in-class PI3K delta inhibitor and advanced it into clinical development, and directed research efforts on multiple discovery projects in inflammation. Prior to Gilead, Dr. Puri was Head of Biology at Calistoga Pharma, where he was responsible for a wide range of activities and was successful in advancing three drug candidates into clinical development for multiple indications.
