Death in Florida was 21st caused by Takata air bags By The Associated Press The Associated Press SHARES 
Florida officials confirmed Wednesday that 34-year-old Nichol Barker was at least the 21st person to die worldwide due to exploding Takata air bag inflators. She was involved in a relatively minor crash in July but died of a head wound caused by shrapnel that shot out of her 2002 Honda Accord's air bag. Nineteen auto and truck makers are recalling up to 69 million inflators in the U.S. and 100 million worldwide because they can explode with too much force and hurl shrapnel at drivers and passengers.
