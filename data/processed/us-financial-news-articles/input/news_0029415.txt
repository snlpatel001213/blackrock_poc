MOSCOW (Reuters) - A storm has damaged parts of a Russian S-400 surface-to-air missile system while it was being shipped to China, RIA news agency said on Friday, quoting a Russian official.
China became the first foreign buyer of the system from Russia under a contract signed in 2014.
The vessel has brought back the damaged components to Russiaâ€™s port of Ust-Luga for evaluation, Mariya Vorobyova, spokeswoman for the military and technical cooperation service told RIA.
They would be delivered to China at a later date, she said.
She gave no details about the damaged components but described them as secondary.
Russia also signed a deal to supply the S-400 missile system to Turkey late last year.
