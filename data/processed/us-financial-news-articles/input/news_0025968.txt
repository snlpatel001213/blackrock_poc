TEL AVIV, Jan 15 (Reuters) - The Tel Aviv Stock Exchange (TASE) is planning to go public on the Tel Aviv bourse sometime in 2019, the bourseâ€™s chief executive officer said on Monday.
TASE has offered to buy out the shares held by its members - commercial and investment banks - at a valuation for the bourse of $150 million, Ittai Ben-Zeev told Reuters on the sidelines of a Dun & Bradstreet capital markets forum at the exchange.
The bourse will also holds talks with operators of stock exchanges abroad about a strategic partnership that could include taking a stake in TASE before it goes public, he said.
The stock exchange was demutualised and become for-profit in September. (Reporting by Tova Cohen and Steven Scheer, Editing by Ari Rabinovitch)
