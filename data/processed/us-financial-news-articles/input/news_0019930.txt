VANCOUVER, Jan. 11, 2018 /PRNewswire/ - GREAT PANTHER SILVER LIMITED (TSX: GPR; NYSE American: GPL) ("Great Panther"; the "Company") announces its fourth quarter ("Q4") and 2017 production results from its two wholly-owned Mexican silver mining operations: the Topia Mine in Durango and the Guanajuato Mine Complex ("GMC"), which includes the San Ignacio Mine.
2017 Production Highlights (Compared to Full Year 2016)
Consolidated metal production increased 2% to 3,978,731 silver equivalent ounces ("Ag eq oz") Silver production decreased 3% to 1,982,685 silver ounces ("Ag oz") Gold production increased 1% to 22,501 gold ounces ("Au oz"), an annual record Ore processed decreased 1% to 373,709 tonnes Topia achieved a record 1,086,663 Ag eq oz in metal production, representing 21% growth
Fourth Quarter 2017 Production Highlights (Compared to Fourth Quarter 2016)
Consolidated metal production increased 21% to 1,065,773 Ag eq oz Silver production increased 12% to 514,218 Ag oz Gold production increased 14% to 5,931 Au oz Ore processed increased 6%, with 98,396 tonnes milled
"Great Panther's 2017 production was consistent with the previous year, however, this was a considerable achievement given the work completed to accommodate the tailings expansion and plant improvements at the Topia Mine in the first quarter of the year", stated James Bannantine, President and CEO. "We are also pleased with the recent completion of the permitting process for the Phase II tailings storage facility at Topia. While the regulatory process took longer than we expected, our team did an outstanding job of maintaining operations by extending capacity while improving the state of the existing facility."

Silver equivalent ounces for 2017 were calculated using a 70:1 Ag:Au ratio, and ratios of 1:0.0559 and 1:0.0676 for the price/ounce of silver to price/pound of lead and zinc, respectively.

Silver equivalent ounces for 2016 were calculated using a 70:1 Ag:Au ratio, and ratios of 1:0.0504 and 1:0.0504 for the price/ounce of silver to price/pound of lead and zinc, respectively.
Guanajuato Mine Complex
Total metal production in the fourth quarter of 2017 increased by 3%, to 724,643 Ag eq oz, compared to the fourth quarter of 2016, due to an increase in gold grades and gold recoveries. The increase in the average gold grade was attributed to increased production from San Ignacio which has as a higher gold to silver ratio. San Ignacio accounted for 62% of the total ore processed at the GMC in Q4 2017, compared to 59% in Q4 2016.
When compared to the previous full year, total metal production decreased by 3%, to 2,892,068 Ag eq oz. The decrease was attributed to the lower silver grades reflecting lower tonnage mined from higher silver grade zones and grade variability in the mineral resource.

Silver equivalent ounces for 2017 and 2016 were calculated using a 70:1 Ag:Au ratio.
Topia Mine
Total metal production during the fourth quarter of 2017 increased by 88%, to 341,129 Ag eq oz, compared to the fourth quarter of 2016, mainly reflecting the planned processing suspension that commenced in December 2016 to complete a plant refurbishment and the addition of a dry tailings handlings facility.
When compared to the previous year, the total metal production increased by 21%, to a record 1,086,663 Ag eq oz, due to a combination of higher grades and recoveries. The increases in grades and recoveries were achieved from more selective mining and a controlled blending of the run of mine ore with stockpiled ore.

As announced last month, the Company obtained all permits for the Phase II tailings storage facility ("TSF") from the environmental authority and construction has since commenced. In the meantime, tailings continue to be deposited at the Phase I facility which has sufficient capacity to allow for an orderly transition to the new Phase II TSF.
OUTLOOK
For 2018, production is expected to be in the range of 4.0 to 4.1 million Ag eq oz (at a 70:1 silver to gold ratio). Cash cost per silver ounce ("cash cost") and all-in sustaining cost per payable silver ounce ("AISC") guidance for 2018 is US$5.00 – 6.50 and US$12.50 – 14.50, respectively. It is cautioned that cash cost and AISC are very sensitive to the Mexican peso foreign exchange rate and metal prices through the computation of by-product credits.
The focus for 2018 will be to maintain steady and efficient operations in Mexico, while advancing the Company's Coricancha Mine in Peru to set a platform for production growth in 2019 and 2020. While still in the early stage of evaluation, based upon historic production records, Coricancha has the potential to add 3 million Ag eq oz of annual production.
Last month, the Company announced an updated NI 43-101 Mineral Resource Estimate for Coricancha which was acquired in June of 2017, and is currently on care and maintenance. The Company is completing optimization studies and evaluating alternative mining methods to reduce costs and project risk, and plans to release additional technical studies for the project in the second quarter of 2018.
The Company also expects to release an updated NI 43-101 Mineral Resource Estimate for the GMC later this month.
