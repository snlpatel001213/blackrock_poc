FORT SMITH, Ark., Jan. 31, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- ArcBest ® (Nasdaq: ARCB) today reported fourth quarter 2017 revenue of $710.7 million compared to fourth quarter 2016 revenue of $688.2 million. Fourth quarter 2017 operating income was $16.7 million compared to operating income of $1.2 million last year. Net income of $36.6 million, or $1.37 per diluted share compared to fourth quarter 2016 net income of $1.6 million, or $0.06 per diluted share. Due to the lower corporate tax rate under the Tax Reform Act, fourth quarter 2017 net income reflects the impact of a $24.5 million reduction of income tax liabilities related to deferred income taxes established under GAAP. While GAAP requires the recognition of the Tax Reform Act impact on deferred taxes in 2017, the realization of those benefits are spread over many future years.
Excluding certain items in both periods as identified in the attached reconciliation tables, non-GAAP net income was $11.2 million, or $0.42 per diluted share, in fourth quarter 2017 compared to the fourth quarter 2016 amount of $7.3 million, or $0.28 per diluted share. On a non-GAAP basis, operating income was $18.5 million in fourth quarter 2017 compared to fourth quarter 2016 operating income of $12.1 million. Cost controls resulting from the enhanced market approach implemented at the beginning of the year continue to be in-line with expectations.
"We began 2017 with an aggressive plan to implement our enhanced market approach," said Chairman, President & CEO Judy McReynolds. "Our customers have been asking for full logistics solutions from us and more manageable points of contact. By responding with a unified sales force, customer service and capacity sourcing, we more expertly answer their total supply chain needs and position the company for growth."
"In addition," said McReynolds, "we undertook a number of significant actions to improve our pricing and ensure that we are adequately compensated for the value we provide customers, particularly in our Asset-Based business. We are pleased with the results of these actions to date, which are in line with our expectations, and are confident we have the right pricing strategy going forward."

Asset-Based
Results of Operations
Fourth Quarter 2017 Versus Fourth Quarter 2016
Revenue of $497.0 million compared to $482.1 million, a per-day increase of 2.3 percent. Tonnage per day decrease of 4.7 percent. Shipments per day decrease 8.1 percent. Total billed revenue per hundredweight increased 7.6 percent and was positively impacted by Asset-Based pricing initiatives and higher fuel surcharges. Excluding fuel surcharge, the percentage increase on ArcBest's Asset-Based LTL freight was in the mid-single digits. Operating income of $18.0 million and an operating ratio of 96.4 percent compared to operating income of $7.1 million and an operating ratio of 98.5 percent. On a non-GAAP basis, operating income of $19.4 million and an operating ratio of 96.1 percent compared to operating income of $8.7 million and an operating ratio of 98.2 percent.
Continued focus on yield management initiatives was reflected in solid increases in revenue per hundredweight and revenue per shipment. This was the most significant factor contributing to the improvement in fourth quarter Asset-Based profitability versus the same period last year. The fourth quarter emphasis on securing compensatory pricing contributed to reductions in shipment and tonnage levels despite a healthy economic environment and tightened industry capacity. Impacted positively by account pricing activities, the recent trend of increasing weight and revenue per shipment continued throughout the fourth quarter. Cost controls and focused workforce management contributed to overall operational labor savings that were somewhat offset by higher union health, welfare and pension expense. Reduced costs for outside resources including city cartage and local rental equipment also contributed positively to fourth quarter results.
Asset-Light ‡
Results of Operations
Fourth Quarter 2017 Versus Fourth Quarter 2016
Revenue of $222.2 million compared to $211.2 million. Operating income of $5.2 million compared to an operating loss of $0.9 million. On a non-GAAP basis, operating income of $5.4 million compared to $7.4 million. Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("Adjusted EBITDA") of $9.1 million compared to Adjusted EBITDA of $10.8 million.
ArcBest's Asset-Light revenue increased primarily as a result of strong revenue per shipment growth in expedite and truckload related to higher customer demand and tightened capacity in the marketplace. The revenue growth in these portions of the Asset-Light business occurred despite shipment count reductions. The fourth quarter operating income decline was related to several factors that included: lower net revenue margins related to rising purchased transportation costs and the difficulty of obtaining commensurate rate increases from Asset-Light shippers; reductions in the military moving business and the handling of fewer consumer moving loads requiring out-of-network resources; and the costs, and related business loss, associated with customer bankruptcies. At FleetNet, a slight increase in total events and improved pricing contributed to revenue growth.
Full Year 201 7 Results
ArcBest's revenue totaled $2.8 billion, compared to $2.7 billion in 2016. Net income was $59.7 million, or $2.25 per diluted share, compared to net income of $18.7 million, or $0.71 per diluted share in 2016. Net income in 2017 was impacted by the Tax Reform Act, as previously described. On a non-GAAP basis, ArcBest had 2017 net income of $35.6 million, or $1.33 per diluted share compared to net income of $24.3 million, or $0.92 per diluted share in 2016.
During 2017, ArcBest increased shareholder returns through payment of an eight cent per share quarterly dividend and purchase of ArcBest shares valued at approximately $6.0 million.
Asset-Based
Results of Operations
Full Year 2017 Versus Full Year 2016
Revenue of $2.0 billion, compared to $1.9 billion in 2016. Tonnage per day decrease of 2.1 percent. Shipments per day were flat. Total billed revenue per hundredweight increased 6.5 percent and was impacted by Asset-Based pricing initiatives and higher fuel surcharges in 2017. Excluding fuel surcharge, the percentage increase on ArcBest's Asset-Based traditional LTL freight was in the mid-single digits. Operating income of $51.9 million and an operating ratio of 97.4 percent compared to $33.6 million and an operating ratio of 98.2 percent. On a non-GAAP basis, an operating ratio of 97.2 percent compared to an operating ratio of 98.0 percent.
Asset-Light ‡
Results of Operations
Full Year 2017 Versus Full Year 2016
Revenue of $863.0 million compared to $803.4 million, an increase of 7.4 percent. Operating income of $22.1 million compared to $9.3 million. On a non-GAAP basis, operating income of $23.6 million compared to $17.7 million. Adjusted EBITDA of $37.2 million compared to $32.4 million.
Capital Expenditures
In 2017, total net capital expenditures equaled $146 million which was somewhat below previous expectations. This included $95 million of revenue equipment, the majority of which was for ArcBest's Asset-Based operation. Depreciation and amortization costs on property, plant and equipment were $99 million.
For 2018, total net capital expenditures are estimated to range from $155 million to $165 million. This includes revenue equipment purchases of approximately $100 million primarily for ArcBest's Asset-Based operation. Because ABF Freight's union labor negotiations are in progress, the timing and actual amount of these capital investments are highly dependent on the outcome of the union labor contract. ArcBest's depreciation and amortization costs on property, plant and equipment in 2018 are estimated to be in a range of $100 million to $105 million.
Closing Comments
McReynolds said 2017 presented challenging conditions with tighter capacity resulting from an improving economy, and impacts from the damaging hurricanes in August and September. "We expect tighter capacity will continue in 2018 as the Electronic Logging Device mandate took effect last December," McReynolds said. "I am confident that our assets, owner operators and relationships with contract carriers will continue to provide comprehensive and valued options for our customers."
"As we go forward, the operating results of our Asset-Based and Asset-Light segments should reflect the investments we are making today," McReynolds said. "We continue to have a great opportunity to grow our company, while also keeping our costs under control. In order to profitably grow our Asset-Based business, we must have the appropriate cost structure and work rules to do so, and we will continue to work on these areas in 2018. We also have a large opportunity to grow Asset-Light revenues thanks to our expanded range of logistics solutions and great relationships with our providers. The future for ArcBest is promising."

Includes the operations of Logistics & Distribution Services, LLC ("LDS") since the September 2016 acquisition date.
2)
The presentation of segment expenses allocated from shared services was modified during third quarter 2017 and reclassifications have been made to the prior period operating segment expenses to conform to the current year presentation. Previously, expenses allocated from company-wide functions were categorized in individual segment expense line items by type of expense. Allocated expense is now presented on a single "Shared services" line within the Company's operating segment disclosures. There was no impact on each segment's total expenses as a result of the reclassifications.
3)
Consolidated and segment operating results for all periods presented were impacted by nonunion pension expense, including settlement. (See ArcBest Corporation - Consolidated and Segment Operating Income Reconciliations of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures tables.)
4)
Restructuring charges relate to the realignment of the Company's organizational structure as announced on November 3, 2016.
5)
Depreciation and amortization consists primarily of amortization of intangibles, including customer relationships, and software associated with acquired businesses.
6)
"Other" corporate costs include $0.2 million and $1.8 million of restructuring charges for the three months and year ended December 31, 2017, respectively, and $0.9 million for the three months and year ended December 31, 2016. (See Segment Operating Income Reconciliations of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures table.) Other corporate costs also include additional investments to provide an improved platform for revenue growth and for offering ArcBest services across multiple operating segments.
ARCBEST CORPORATION
RECONCILIATIONS OF GAAP TO NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
Non-GAAP Financial Measures . We report our financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). However, management believes that certain non-GAAP performance measures and ratios, such as Adjusted EBITDA, utilized for internal analysis provide analysts, investors, and others the same information that we use internally for purposes of assessing our core operating performance and provides meaningful comparisons between current and prior period results, as well as important information regarding performance trends. Accordingly, using these measures improves comparability in analyzing our performance because it removes the impact of items from operating results that, in management's opinion, do not reflect our core operating performance. Management uses Adjusted EBITDA as a key measure of performance and for business planning. The measure is particularly meaningful for analysis of the Asset-Light businesses, because they exclude amortization of acquired intangibles and software, which are significant expenses resulting from strategic decisions rather than core daily operations. Additionally, Adjusted EBITDA is a primary component of the financial covenants contained in our Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. Other companies may calculate EBITDA differently; therefore, our calculation of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. Certain information discussed in the scheduled conference call could be considered non-GAAP measures. Non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative for, our reported results. These financial measures should not be construed as better measurements than operating income, operating cash flow, net income or earnings per share, as determined under GAAP.

2)
Nonunion pension expense is presented as a non-GAAP adjustment with pension settlement expense, for all periods presented, because expenses related to the plan have been excluded from the financial information management uses to make operating decisions, as an amendment to terminate the nonunion defined benefit pension plan with a termination date of December 31, 2017 was executed in November 2017. Plan participants will have an election window in which they can choose any form of payment allowed by the plan for immediate commencement of payment or defer payment until a later date with pension settlements related to the plan termination likely to occur in the second half of 2018.
3)
Transaction costs for the year ended December 31, 2016 are associated with the September 2, 2016 acquisition of Logistics & Distribution Services, LLC.
4)
Impact on current and deferred income tax expense as a result of recognizing a reasonable estimate of the tax effects of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ("2017 Tax Reform Act") that was signed into law on December 22, 2017.
5)
The Company recognized the tax impact for the vesting of share-based compensation resulting in excess tax expense during the three months ended December 31, 2017 and excess tax benefit during the year ended December 31, 2017.
