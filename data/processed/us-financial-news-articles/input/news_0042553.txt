Senator Dianne Feinstein, a senior member of the Senate Intelligence Committee and the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, and Representative Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House of Representatives Intelligence Committee, wrote to Twitter Inc and Facebook Inc requesting an “in-depth forensic examination.” (Reporting by Patricia Zengerle, Editing by Franklin Paul)
