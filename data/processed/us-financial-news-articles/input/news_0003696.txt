STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Malmo University in the south of Sweden informed students and teachers on Thursday it would be closed on Monday due to a threat emailed to the university.
The university said on its website the threat was serious and targeted Jan. 8 specifically. It gave no further details but said the police had launched a preliminary criminal investigation.
The police were not immediately available for comment.
On April 7 last year a man drove a truck into people on a busy pedestrian street in the Swedish capital, Stockholm, killing five. He later confessed to committing an act of terrorism.
