SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Singapore has ordered the removal of fugitive Vietnamese businessman Phan Van Anh Vu from the country, a government letter that was dated Thursday and reviewed by Reuters showed. 
The letter sent by Singapore’s Immigration and Checkpoints Authority to Vu’s lawyer, which includes an ‘order of removal’ dated Dec. 30, said Vietnamese authorities informed the agency the passport Vu used to enter the country with was “fake”. 
Vu remained in Singapore as of Wednesday, but one of his lawyers, Remy Choo, told Reuters on Thursday that he did not know the current whereabouts of his client. 
Singapore’s immigration authority had no immediate comment. Reporting by John Geddie; Editing by Christian Schmollinger
