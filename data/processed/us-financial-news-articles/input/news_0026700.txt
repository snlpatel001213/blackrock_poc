Sending the “chaiOS” link can cause the recipient’s Apple product to crash even if the recipient doesn’t click on it, computer security analyst Graham Cluley writes on his blog . The bug was shown to affect iPhones and cause Safari to crash on Mac computers, BBC reports . 
The software developer who uncovered the issue, Abraham Masri, posted the code on programming website GitHub, before it was later taken down, according to BBC. Masri claims to have reported the bug already. 
“No, I’m not going to re-upload it. I made my point. Apple needs to take such bugs more seriously,” Masri tweeted. No, I'm not going to re-upload it. I made my point. Apple needs to take such bugs more seriously.
