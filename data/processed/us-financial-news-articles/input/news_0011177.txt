Twitter said the coverage of the tournament, taking place from June 14 to July 15, will be available in the United States and can be seen using the @FOXsoccer Twitter handle. 
Live-streaming has been one of Twitter’s biggest focus areas since last year as it seeks to attract new users. 
The company had previously signed a multi-year deal with the U.S. National Football League to live-stream pre-game coverage as well as a 30-minute show. Reporting by Arjun Panchadar in Bengaluru; Editing by Saumyadeb Chakrabarty
