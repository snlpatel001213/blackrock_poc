The U.S. Federal Communications Commission on Tuesday faulted the Hawaii Emergency Management Agency's procedures over a false emergency alert on January 13 of a pending missile attack that prompted widespread panic.
The false alarm, which went uncorrected for 38 minutes after being transmitted to mobile phones and broadcast stations, caused widespread panic across the Pacific islands state.
The FCC said a miscommunication in part led to the mistake. The employee who transmitted the alert said in a written statement to Hawaii that he or she believed it was an actual alert.
The FCC said that Hawaii has been testing alert capabilities, and the employee mistook a drill for a real warning about a missile threat. He responded by sending the alert without sign-off from a supervisor.
The name of the worker hasn't been released. He still works at Hawaii Emergency Management Agency but has been reassigned to a job without access to the warning system.
The alert was sent to cellphones, TV and radio stations in Hawaii, leading people to fear the state was under nuclear attack. It took 38 minutes for officials to send an alert retracting the warning.
