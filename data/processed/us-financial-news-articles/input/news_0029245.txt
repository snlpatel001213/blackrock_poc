“ Venture capital funding into Digital Health spiked after plateauing the last couple of years. Artificial intelligence and Data Analytics companies had a breakout year with over a billion dollars raised. Digital Health public companies had a much better 2016 compared to previous years with a majority of stocks outperforming the S&P500. However, a buoyant stock market did not translate into companies going public. For the first time in years, no companies issued an IPO in all of 2017. M&A activity, on the other hand, has been declining slightly over the last few years. Investors do not want to miss out on the sheer size and potential of this growing market, but the exit path for many companies remains elusive,” commented Raj Prabhu, CEO and Co-Founder of Mercom Capital Group.
