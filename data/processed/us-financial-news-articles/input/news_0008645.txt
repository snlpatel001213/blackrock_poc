PRINCETON, N.J., Jan. 9, 2018 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- The New Jersey Hospital Association this week welcomed Victoria Brogan of Moorestown as senior vice president of strategic initiatives.
In the newly created position, Brogan will serve as the "point person" for NJHA initiatives to advance the goal of improving the health of New Jersey, said NJHA President and CEO Cathy Bennett.
Brogan most recently served as deputy chief of staff in the N.J. Department of Health where her responsibilities included strategic planning, public health initiatives and policy and legislation. She also has worked in both the N.J. Senate Republican Office and Assembly Republican Office.
"I've had the pleasure of working with Victoria at the Department of Health," said Bennett. "She is a dynamic thinker, strong on policy, data and trends. She's also a pleasure to work with, both as a colleague and a collaborator with other stakeholders. I'm excited to have her be part of NJHA's ongoing work as a thought leader on good health for the people of New Jersey."
Brogan joins NJHA as the organization is engaged in a strategic planning process in response to dramatic changes nationally in healthcare delivery. The goal is to better position NJHA and its 300-plus members, comprised of hospitals, health systems, nursing homes, home health, hospice and other providers, to focus on population health, wellness and keeping New Jersey residents healthy in their communities.
