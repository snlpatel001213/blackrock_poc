Fourth Quarter 2017 Financial Highlights
(Commentary is on a fully taxable-equivalent basis unless otherwise noted. Consistent with SEC guidance in Industry Guide 3 that contemplates the calculation of tax-exempt income on a tax equivalent basis, net interest income, net interest margin, total revenue, and efficiency ratios are provided on a fully taxable-equivalent basis, which generally assumes a 35% marginal federal tax rate and state income taxes, where applicable. We provide unadjusted amounts in the table on page 3 of this news release and detailed reconciliations and additional information in Appendix A on pages 12 through 13.)
Income Statement
Net income available to common shareholders was $710 million, or $1.48 per average common diluted share, compared to $1.06 for the prior quarter and $0.90 for the fourth quarter of 2016. This quarter was favorably impacted by $0.39 per share of net discrete benefits in connection with the items announced in the December 4, 2017 Form 8-K and tax reform-related items. Total revenue was stable compared to the prior quarter and increased 5% compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. The year-over-year increase was driven primarily by higher net interest income and slightly higher noninterest income. Net interest margin was 3.17% in the current quarter, up 2 basis points sequentially and up 17 basis points compared to the prior year. The year-over-year increase was driven by higher earning asset yields arising from higher benchmark interest rates, positive mix shift in the loans held for investment ("LHFI") portfolio, and higher securities AFS yields given lower premium amortization expense. Provision for credit losses decreased $41 million sequentially due to the prior quarter reserve build related to hurricanes, and decreased $22 million year-over-year due to lower net charge-offs. Noninterest expense increased 9% sequentially and year-over-year. The December 4, 2017 Form 8-K and tax reform-related items impacted noninterest expense by a net $111 million ($50 million charitable contribution to the SunTrust Foundation, $36 million net charges related to efficiency initiatives, and $25 million discretionary 401(k) contribution and other employee benefits). Excluding these discrete items, noninterest expense was relatively stable compared to the prior quarter and prior year. The efficiency and tangible efficiency ratios for the current quarter were 65.9% and 64.8%, respectively, which were unfavorably impacted by the effect of Form 8-K and tax reform-related items presented in the table on page 1. Excluding these items, the adjusted tangible efficiency ratio was 59.9% for the current quarter, compared to 59.2% for the prior quarter and 63.1% for the fourth quarter of 2016. For the full year, the efficiency and tangible efficiency ratios were 63.1% and 62.3%, respectively. The adjusted tangible efficiency ratio was 61.0%, down approximately 100 bps from 2016 as a result of positive operating leverage.
Balance Sheet
Average performing LHFI were stable sequentially and grew 1% year-over-year, driven primarily by growth in consumer lending. Average consumer and commercial deposits increased modestly compared to the prior quarter and 2% compared to the fourth quarter of 2016, driven largely by growth in NOW and time deposit account balances.
Capital
Estimated capital ratios continue to be well above regulatory requirements. The Common Equity Tier 1 ("CET1") ratio was estimated to be 9.8% as of December 31, 2017, and 9.6% on a fully phased-in basis, slightly higher than the prior quarter. During the quarter, the Company repurchased $330 million of its outstanding common stock in accordance with its 2017 Capital Plan and issued $500 million of 5.125% noncumulative perpetual preferred stock, Series H. Book value per common share was $47.94 and tangible book value per common share was $34.82, up 2% and 1%, respectively, from September 30, 2017, driven primarily by growth in retained earnings.
Asset Quality
Nonperforming loans ("NPLs") decreased $23 million from the prior quarter and represented 0.47% of period-end LHFI at December 31, 2017. The sequential decrease was driven primarily by continued improvements in the energy portfolio. Net charge-offs for the current quarter were $107 million, or 0.29% of total average LHFI on an annualized basis, up $29 million sequentially and down $29 million year-over-year. The sequential increase was driven by higher net charge-offs associated with C&I and consumer loans, while the year-over-year reduction was driven by overall asset quality improvements and lower energ
