PARIS (Reuters) - French President Emmanuel Macron stressed to Donald Trump in a telephone call on Thursday the importance of abiding by a nuclear deal with Iran ahead of a decision by the U.S. president that could reimpose sanctions on the country. 
“The president ... recalled France’s determination in favor of a strict application of the agreement and the importance of its respect by all of its signatories,” the French presidency said in a statement. 
“The proper implementation of the agreement should be accompanied by a strengthened dialogue with Iran on its ballistic program and its regional policy, in order to guarantee better stability in the Middle East.” Reporting by John Irish; editing by Andrew Roche
