-- Fiscal 2017 Marked by Actions to Advance Drug Pipeline; First New Drug Application (NDA) on Track for Submission in First Half of 2018; Three Additional NDAs Expected to be Filed: Two in 2019 and One in 2020 --
Company to Host Investor Conference Call on Friday, January 5, 2018, 8 AM Eastern Time
MIAMI, Jan. 02, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Veru Inc. (NASDAQ:VERU) today announced its financial results for the fiscal 2017 fourth quarter and full year ended September 30, 2017.
“Our fiscal 2017 financial results reflect the risk and volatility associated with being a single product company and, more importantly, validate the strategic rationale for the acquisition completed late last year, which brought a pipeline of multiple high-value, low-risk product candidates,” said Mitchell Steiner, M.D., President and Chief Executive Officer of Veru. “While revenues from FC2 were disappointing due in part to the sales cycle and dependence on a few global public-sector customers, the past year was marked by a number of critical accomplishments and actions, including the excellent progress we made advancing the development of our pipeline toward commercialization. These efforts included meeting with the FDA to streamline and clarify the regulatory pathway for approval of almost all of our drug candidates.
“Following is a summary of our progress for products added as a result of the acquisition: Tamsulosin DRS, a novel formulation of a widely prescribed drug for benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), completed the first and second stages of a bioequivalence clinical trial; VERU-944, for hot flashes in men receiving hormone therapy for prostate cancer, completed the necessary steps required to initiate a Phase 2 clinical trial in early 2018; and VERU-111, a New Chemical Entity (NCE) for advanced prostate and other cancers, completed a significant portion of the required preclinical work as well as established the process to manufacture the drug in preparation of commencing human clinical trials in 2018.
“More recently, we monetized a portion of outstanding accounts receivable and completed the acquisition of two exciting new drug candidates, which not only address large patient populations but also further expand our portfolio of products for the urology and oncology markets. Importantly, the FDA has agreed that for each product a single bioequivalence study would be acceptable for a 505(b)(2) NDA filing. We also are encouraged by positive preclinical data that showed additional efficacy of our VERU-111 product for a number of different cancer types. The new data will be presented at national scientific meetings in 2018.
“Looking ahead, we expect to file with the FDA the Company’s first New Drug Application (NDA) for Tamsulosin DRS in the first half of 2018. Moreover, we plan to submit three additional NDAs: two in 2019 and another NDA in 2020. Regarding sales of our commercial products, we are seeing traction following the implementation of several initiatives to grow our US revenue for FC2 and we are optimistic about potential near-term orders for FC2 from two large international public-sector customers.”
