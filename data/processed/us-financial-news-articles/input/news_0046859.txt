Management Discussion
Clint Severson, chairman and chief executive officer of Abaxis, said, "We are very pleased to achieve revenues of $59.7 million in the third quarter, an increase of 13% compared to the same period last year. Driven by a strong growth in instrument and consumable sales during the third quarter, revenues in our medical and veterinary market segments increased by 18% and 12%, respectively, compared to the same period last year. Year-over-year revenue growth of medical and veterinary reagent discs was 17% and 12%, respectively, in the third quarter, over the same period last year."
Mr. Severson continued, "Our new VetScan UA, a urine chemistry analyzer, had a tremendous launch, as we sold over 1,300 instruments since its introduction in late September 2017. Additionally, during the third quarter of fiscal 2018, we placed over 100 units of the VetScan FUSE, a bi-directional connectivity system that provides integration between Abaxis point-of-care analyzers and veterinary practice management systems worldwide.
"We are excited about our outlook for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 based on our expectations for growth in the core business and several important new product launches. For example, we plan to launch our new urine sediment analyzer which targets a large veterinary market segment later this quarter. Furthermore, the USDA, Center for Veterinary Biologics, recently approved our VetScan FLEX4 Rapid Test, a combination test for heartworm, lyme, ehrlichia and anaplasma. We are excited to introduce and sell this product to veterinarians at the VMX conference in early February 2018."
Mr. Severson concluded, "Looking to the future, we anticipate making additional investments in new product development. With our focus on innovation and an expanding field sales force we are optimistic about our future."

Other Reported Information
Non-cash compensation expense recognized for share-based awards during the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 was $3.6 million and $2.4 million, respectively. Abaxis paid $3.6 million in cash dividends to shareholders during the third quarter of fiscal 2018.
Following the recent enactment of the TCJA on December 22, 2017, Abaxis expects its effective income tax rate to decline by 200 to 300 basis points in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017, excluding a one-time non-cash charge described above. Abaxis estimates its effective income tax rate in fiscal 2019 will be lower by 1,000 to 1,200 basis points compared to fiscal 2017. The actual impact of the TCJA on the Company's effective income tax rates may differ from the estimates due to changes in interpretations and assumptions made by the Company. The Company anticipates subsequent regulations associated with the TCJA will be forthcoming and will continue to analyze the tax legislation to determine the full effects of the new law on Abaxis' consolidated financial statements.

Non-GAAP Financial Measure
To supplement the financial statements presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP), Abaxis uses the non-GAAP financial measure of non-GAAP diluted net income per share. The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. Abaxis defines non-GAAP diluted net income per share as net income per share on a diluted basis excluding from net income the one-time non-cash charge due to a reduction in deferred tax assets as a result of the TCJA enacted on December 22, 2017. Abaxis uses this non-GAAP financial measure for financial and operational decision making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. Management believes that this non-GAAP financial measure provides meaningful supplemental information regarding Abaxis' performance and liquidity by excluding a one-time non-cash charge resulting from changes to tax laws, that may not be indicative of recurring core business operating results or operating performance. A reconciliation from GAAP net income and GAAP diluted net income per share to non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted net income per share, respectively, has been provided in the financial statement tables included below in this press release.
