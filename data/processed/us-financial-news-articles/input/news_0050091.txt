MOSCOW (Reuters) - New U.S. sanctions against Russia are a destructive step which further worsens relations between Moscow and Washington, RIA news agency cited a senior Russian lawmaker as saying on Friday.
The United States added Russian officials and energy firms to a sanctions blacklist earlier on Friday, days before details of further possible penalties against Moscow are due to be released.
Leonid Slutsky, head of the lower house of parliamentâ€™s foreign affairs committee, said Russia would retaliate against the new sanctions, RIA reported.
